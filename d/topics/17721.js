This genetic abnormality results in the formation of a unique gene product (BCR-ABL), which results in a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. It is this deregulated tyrosine kinase that is implicated in the development of CML and is the target of current therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imatinib</a> mesylate was the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used in the treatment of CML. Since then, several other TKIs have been developed for the treatment of patients with CML, most notably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosutinib</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ponatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ponatinib</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors-for-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CML has historically been a triphasic disease. Approximately 85 to 90 percent of patients present in a chronic stable phase. Without treatment, this inevitably progresses to a more aggressive, accelerated phase, and then culminates in a very difficult to treat blast crisis. With advances in the treatment of chronic phase CML, fewer patients (approximately 6 percent at five years) are progressing to accelerated phase and blast crisis. In addition, 10 to 15 percent of patients will initially present in accelerated phase or blast crisis.</p><p>The treatment of CML in blast crisis is discussed here. The treatment of CML in chronic or accelerated phase is discussed separately, as is the use of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-accelerated-phase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in accelerated phase&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-chronic-phase-after-failure-of-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase after failure of initial therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In approximately 30 percent of cases, blast crisis in CML is of the lymphoid (ie, acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), rather than the myeloid (ie, acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) phenotype. TKIs can be incorporated into a treatment plan for these and other patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults#H58829265\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;, section on 'TKI plus chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF BLAST CRISIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blast crisis of CML, occasionally of sudden onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], is an ominous clinical event that is difficult to treat. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines blast crisis by the presence of one or more of the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;20 percent peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large foci or clusters of blasts on the bone marrow biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of extramedullary blastic infiltrates (eg, myeloid sarcoma also known as granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]</p><p/><p>Of note, previous definitions of blast crisis used different cutoff values for the percent blasts in the bone marrow such that patients with 20 to 30 percent blasts were not included. This is important to keep in mind when making historical comparisons between response rates to treatment. In most patients, blast crisis evolves from a prior accelerated or chronic phase. The clinical and morphologic features seen in patients developing lymphoid blast crisis after a known period with CML are similar to those presenting de novo with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93914312\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION UPON TRANSFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with CML typically present in chronic phase and in the tyrosine kinase treatment era, progress to blast crisis at a rate of approximately 1 percent per year. In patients who achieve and maintain a complete cytogenetic remission two years after diagnosis, transformation is very rare. In contrast, before these drugs were available, the median time to progression was three to four years after diagnosis. Thus, most cases of blast crisis will have a known diagnosis of CML at the time of transformation. A minority of patients with CML will be in blast crisis at the time of diagnosis. </p><p>Transformation may be suggested clinically by the development of signs and symptoms more typical of acute leukemia (eg, night sweats, weight loss, fever, bone pain, symptoms of anemia). Evaluation of the patient with suspected blast crisis includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, and glucose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be sent for pathology review, flow cytometry, cytochemistry, and cytogenetics. Flow cytometry and cytochemistry are performed to classify the blasts as myeloid or lymphoid and cytogenetics evaluates for clonal evolution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BCR-ABL kinase mutational analysis to aid in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing should be performed for patients who are candidates for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and a donor search should be initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Patients with blast crisis should be hospitalized if they have complications including fever, tumor lysis, and renal failure. If they have no complications and appear to be responding to treatment with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, they can be treated as outpatients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">REMISSION INDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aim of initial management is to revert to chronic phase with plans to proceed with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in chronic phase, if possible.</p><p>There are two major forms of blast crisis in patients with CML: lymphoid and myeloid. Lymphoid blast crisis (ie, acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]) accounts for approximately 30 percent and myeloid blast crisis (ie, acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) accounts for approximately 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A small percentage of cases have an undifferentiated or mixed phenotype. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93914278\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphoid blast crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphoid blast crisis with a B lineage immunophenotype accounts for approximately 30 percent of cases and often responds to treatments used for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). Details regarding the treatment of Ph+ ALL are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults#H58829265\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;, section on 'TKI plus chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>Retrospective studies have reported on the outcomes of patients with lymphoid blast crisis treated with regimens for Ph+ ALL. In one report from MD Anderson, 42 patients with lymphoid blast phase CML were treated with hyperfractionated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (Hyper-CVAD) alternating with high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> (27 patients) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a> (15 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The majority (90 percent) achieved a complete hematologic response, with complete cytogenetic remission and complete molecular remission occurring in 58 and 25 percent, respectively. Median duration of remission was 14 months, and median overall survival was 17 months. Allogeneic HCT was associated with longer median survival (93 versus 9 months).</p><p>Currently, lymphoid blast crisis develops most often in patients who either have been, or are currently being, treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In such individuals, a switch to a second or third generation TKI is necessary. In the occasional patient who has had CML but has not been treated with a TKI, therapy should be given as described for apparently &quot;de novo&quot; Ph+ ALL. Sometimes TKI can be administered in combination with lower intensity chemotherapy in an attempt to achieve remission prior to transplantation. This approach is also sometimes considered in older, frailer individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults#H58829265\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;, section on 'TKI plus chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93914267\"><span class=\"h2\">Myeloid blast crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myeloid blast crisis, which occurs in approximately 70 percent of cases, does not respond well to standard induction regimens for AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], although responses to TKIs, alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>] or in combination with chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], have been noted. The preferred initial treatment is the use of a TKI (with or without chemotherapy) followed by an allogeneic HCT for eligible patients. The decision to incorporate AML-type induction chemotherapy into the treatment regimen depends upon whether the patient presents de novo or evolves to blast crisis while on a TKI. Although we treat de novo myeloid blast crisis with TKI alone until we can assess the response, if myeloid blast crisis develops while a patient is already taking a TKI, we administer AML-type induction chemotherapy combined with a more potent TKI for remission induction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia in younger adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Survival after allogeneic HCT correlates with disease phase at the time of transplantation with estimated two-year survival rates of 25, 50, and 65 percent for those in blast crisis, accelerated phase, and chronic phase, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A reasonable plan is an attempt to return the patient to an earlier phase of disease, with suitable candidates subsequently undergoing allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. TKI treatment prior to transplantation has not been associated with an increase in transplant-associated morbidity or mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-chronic-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation in chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93914621\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of TKI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of data regarding the choice of TKI to be used as the initial therapy for patients with blast crisis, regardless of whether the patient is a candidate for HCT. In general, we suggest treatment with a second generation TKI (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilotinib</a>) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>. Second generation TKIs should certainly be used if the disease <span class=\"nowrap\">progression/blast</span> crisis occurred while the patient was already taking imatinib for earlier stage CML. Similarly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ponatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ponatinib</a> can be considered if the progression occurred while the patients was receiving dasatinib, nilotinib, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosutinib</a>. This preference is largely based on the extrapolation of data from randomized trials of these agents as initial therapy in patients with chronic phase CML. In these trials, second generation TKIs resulted in faster and deeper responses than imatinib, especially among patients with higher risk chronic phase CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Given the expected lower response rates in blast crisis, the greater potency of these agents would be expected to have an even more important role. In addition, second generation TKIs have been proven to induce responses in imatinib-resistant CML, and this resistance is more likely to occur in blast crisis. </p><p>A choice among agents should also take into consideration the drug side effect profiles, results from a BCR-ABL kinase mutation analysis, and the patient's comorbidities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89930 \">table 1</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dasatinib</a> has the advantage of being able to cross the blood brain barrier. The following sections review data regarding their use in blast crisis. Randomized trials comparing these agents in chronic phase CML are presented separately.

The approved dose in this setting is 600 mg by mouth daily. The following is a summary of trials that have investigated the use of imatinib in the treatment of CML in blast crisis. It should be noted that these trials were conducted in the &quot;pre-imatinib&quot; era and hence these patients had not previously been treated with a TKI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a dose-escalating pilot study, patients with CML in blast crisis (defined in this study as &gt;30 percent blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow) were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> at doses ranging from 300 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

A variety of monitoring schedules for patients with CML are acceptable. Patients in blast crisis need to be seen frequently for management of cytopenias and frequently require red blood cell and platelet transfusion. Post-transfusion platelet increments are often compromised by the splenomegaly that commonly accompanies blast crisis. Because cytogenetic response can sometimes occur in the absence of hematologic count recovery, it is reasonable to perform a bone marrow examination after approximately a month of treatment in patients who seem to have responded in terms of elimination of circulating blasts and palpable splenomegaly.</p><p>The European LeukemiaNet has developed definitions of treatment failure, optimal response, and warning signs following the use of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) as first-line therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90418 \">table 2</a>) and the use of second-line therapy in cases of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90421\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90421 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

As such, all patients should be evaluated at the time of transformation for transplant eligibility. Eligibility for HCT varies across countries and institutions. Although data supporting such criteria are limited, patients are often excluded based on age (&gt;70 years old), uncontrolled infection, cardiac, pulmonary, liver or renal dysfunction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychosocial variables. General guidelines are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Either matched-related, matched-unrelated donors, or haploidentical related donors (preferable at times since donors can be identified rapidly) can be used for CML in the setting of blast crisis since other treatment options are not very effective.

We suggest transplantation once a maximum response to a TKI has been realized rather than continuation of the TKI without HCT. The rationale for this approach is that success with HCT is most likely in patients with relatively quiescent disease. There are no data comparing continuation of a TKI versus transplantation in the relatively small group of patients in whom a complete cytogenetic response is obtained with TKI treatment. There is concern, however, that if HCT is postponed until a second TKI is required for relapse, the chance of inducing a similar level of response is lower. </p><p>Treatment with a TKI is given prior to HCT in an attempt to return the patient to an earlier phase of disease. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imatinib</a> treatment for blast crisis can result in objective responses in approximately half of patients with 15 percent attaining a second chronic phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Responses appear to be higher for those treated with second generation TKIs. Because of the truly transient nature of responses in this phase of CML, treatment with imatinib alone should be considered palliative and is not an appropriate longer term treatment alternative for patients who are eligible for HCT.</p><p>It is uncertain whether there is any benefit to using a TKI after HCT for patients transplanted for chronic phase CML if a molecular remission has been achieved. Frequent BCR-ABL minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring is advisable for such patients. For patients transplanted for CML in myeloid or lymphoid blast crisis, we suggest the use of a TKI for two years after allogeneic HCT, if tolerable, rather than postponing its use until the emergence of MRD positivity, especially if nonmyeloablative conditioning is used. It should be noted, however, that there are few data about whether longer use of a TKI is advisable.</p><p>Chemotherapy has been used for patients in blast crisis in an attempt to return the patient to an earlier phase of disease and then proceed with transplantation in eligible patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Treatment options include the chronic administration of a TKI or enrollment in a clinical trial. The median survival of patients with blast crisis treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> therapy in several phase II trials were 3, 6, and 17 months for those with no response, unsustained response, or sustained response, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Among patients who show a response to treatment, we recommend continuing the TKI as long as the patient continues to show a response. Even though TKIs are not curative and responses are often short-lived, they are oral medications that are fairly well tolerated. In addition, very occasional patients may enjoy a long term response with TKIs alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Detailed information on drug toxicity and management of side effects is discussed separately.

Although there have been no randomized trials that have directly compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> with such regimens, a historical comparison shows significantly better response rates (55 versus 29 percent) and median survival (7 versus 4 months) with less toxicity with imatinib compared with treatment with chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia-in-blast-crisis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>No trials have compared the use of a TKI alone possibly followed by chemotherapy after a response has been achieved (if a transplant is not feasible) with the combination of chemotherapy and a TKI given together as initial treatment. Given the poor results with chemotherapy alone, most, if not all, patients should receive a TKI as part of their initial induction regimen.</p><p>Lastly, a small (&lt;1 percent) number of patients with apparently de novo AML with no prior history or signs of CML will be found to have a t(9;22) when their cytogenetic results become available. Often, they have already received and sometimes completed standard AML induction therapy.
