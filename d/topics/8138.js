(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HAV infection is usually self-limited, and treatment consists of supportive care. Medications that might cause liver damage or are metabolized by the liver should be used with caution. Full clinical and biochemical recovery are observed within two to three months in most patients, and complete recovery is observed by six months in nearly all patients.
