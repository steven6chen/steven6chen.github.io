This commonly reported sensation is produced by the muscular contraction of the bladder and the peristaltic activity of the urethra, both of which stimulate the pain fibers of the edematous and inflamed mucosa. In addition, pain may occur when urine comes into contact with the inflamed mucosa. </p><p>In young children, the caregiver may report dysuria because of crying associated with urination or a wet diaper. In these patients, the chief complaint of dysuria is not as specific and may reflect other sources of discomfort. For example, young children may also complain of painful urination when they are instead experiencing related symptoms, such as pruritus as is seen with <em>Enterobius vermicularis</em> (pinworms) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;, section on 'Pinworm'</a>). Diaper dermatitis may also present with dysuria caused by skin irritation after voiding. In addition, those who have experienced sexual abuse may present with a complaint of dysuria, which has no physical basis, or they may exhibit behaviors that are interpreted by adult observers as indicative of genital pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysuria may be caused by a wide range of infectious and noninfectious causes, but it usually stems from one of several common disorders of childhood and adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55819 \">table 1</a>). Most children with dysuria as a chief complaint will have primary disorders of the genitourinary tract. Although patients with urethritis secondary to systemic illnesses may have dysuria as one of their many symptoms, this specific complaint is only occasionally the principal reason for seeking care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are severe mucocutaneous reactions, most commonly triggered by medications, characterized by extensive necrosis and detachment of the epidermis, which may affect the mucous membranes throughout the body; this produces conjunctivitis, oral ulceration, and urethritis. Although dysuria may be present, the primary finding is a rash consisting of ill-defined, coalescing erythematous macules with purpuric centers, although many cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> may present with diffuse erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67632%7EDERM%2F68458%7EDERM%2F59418%7EALLRG%2F66134\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67632 graphicRef68458 graphicRef59418 graphicRef66134 \">picture 1A-D</a>). The skin is often tender to the touch and skin pain can be prominent and out of proportion to the cutaneous findings. Lesions start on the face and thorax before spreading to other areas and are symmetrically distributed. The scalp is typically spared, and palms and soles are rarely involved. Atypical target lesions with darker centers may be present.

In adolescents, <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> are the most commonly isolated pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-dysuria-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes urethritis, vesicles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ulcers are usually apparent on examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-dysuria-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Note that HSV in prepubertal children may occur from autoinoculation in conjunction with herpetic stomatitis, herpetic whitlow, or may result from sexual contact. Autoinoculation of HSV in prepubertal children is more common in boys. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexually transmitted infections: Issues specific to adolescents&quot;, section on 'STI clinical patterns'</a>.)</p><p>A sexually transmitted etiology in prepubertal children should raise concern for sexual abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bulbar urethritis, a urological problem that affects adolescent males, presents with dysuria and microscopic hematuria. It is presumably of viral origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-dysuria-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H865257733\"><span class=\"h4\">Cystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cystitis or lower urinary tract infection (UTI) often present with suprapubic pain or tenderness. They may or may not have fever, which, if present, is usually low grade.

Painful swelling of the glans penis and foreskin are typically present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanoposthitis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Balanoposthitis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5582857\"><span class=\"h4\">Vaginitis and cervicitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginitis may cause dysuria in both prepubertal girls and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-and-evaluation-of-dysuria-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Sexually transmitted pathogens and <em>Candida albicans</em> are frequently isolated in postpubertal girls. Although these same organisms may be found in younger girls, one must consider nonsexually transmitted agents, such as Group A <em>Streptococcus</em> and <em>Shigella</em> species. When sexually transmitted pathogens are isolated in prepubertal girls, the clinician should suspect sexual abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p>In many cases, the physical examination reveals a discharge, which varies from scant (nonspecific vaginitis) to thick and green (gonorrhea) to white and cheesy (Candida). Foreign bodies may also be a cause of vaginitis leading to dysuria in prepubertal girls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexually transmitted infections: Issues specific to adolescents&quot;, section on 'STI clinical patterns'</a>.)</p><p>Cervicitis is seen in postpubertal girls and is associated with sexually transmitted infection. Like vaginitis, it typically presents with vaginal discharge. However, isolated dysuria is also well described.

It usually manifests with fever, frequently above 38.5 to 39&deg;C, and flank pain or tenderness (older children and adolescents).

Although PID may be accompanied by dysuria, fever and <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain are usually the chief complaints. Vaginal discharge and cervical motion tenderness are frequently present upon examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Noninfectious conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Irritation around the urethra from any source can cause dysuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5582889\"><span class=\"h4\">Nonspecific (chemical) urethritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential local irritants include detergents, fabric softeners, perfumed soaps, and possibly bubble baths.

In both older children and adolescents, normal self-exploratory sexual play, masturbation, voluntary sexual activity, or sexual abuse may be the source of the trauma. As in patients with chemical urethritis, the examination is generally unremarkable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3615848145\"><span class=\"h4\">Urinary stones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary stones (nephrolithiasis) develop occasionally in children and adolescents, usually in the setting of anatomic abnormalities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent infection. Their passage may be associated with complaint of dysuria in about 10 percent of patients, but usually associated with flank pain and hematuria. Children with idiopathic hypercalciuria and idiopathic hyperuricosuria, known antecedents of renal calculi, may complain of dysuria even in the absence of an observable stone and may also have hematuria. A minority of patients with urinary stones may also have a UTI. The evaluation of children with hematuria due to kidney stones, hypercalciuria, or hyperuricosuria is discussed separately.

After two to three days, a characteristic pruritic rash appears centrally and then spreads peripherally. By the second or third day of the eruption, lesions may involve the perineum and vagina and lead to a complaint of itching <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysuria.

The choice of specific testing depends upon whether the evaluation is due to suspicion of sexual abuse or relates to evaluation of an adolescent engaging in consensual sexual intercourse. (See <a href=\"#H5582591\" class=\"local\">'Possible sexually transmitted infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmenarchal females warrant pregnancy testing in addition to urine tests and, if indicated based upon clinical findings, testing for sexually transmitted infection. Several of the conditions causing dysuria occur more frequently in sexually active <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gravid women. In addition, pregnancy may influence the subsequent therapeutic choices.
