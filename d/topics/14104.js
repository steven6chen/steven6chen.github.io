For women who have not had preconception counseling, a complete risk evaluation should occur at the first antenatal visit. </p><p>In developed health care systems, women are typically aware of significant health conditions in advance of pregnancy; however, occasionally, pregnancy unmasks a previously unrecognized valve lesion. This latter scenario may be more frequent in developing health care systems, for instance in women with undiagnosed rheumatic mitral stenosis who first present during pregnancy. </p><p>In general, there are many health outcome benefits to seeking preconception counseling. Women with valvular heart disease (VHD) should have a preconception evaluation by a cardiologist with expertise in pregnancy and VHD. Risk assessment for women with VHD should involve a focused evaluation of the risk for the mother and baby. Many women with heart disease are unaware of the risks of pregnancy, and patient education is an important aspect of the preconception assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In patients presenting with valve disease, it is important to determine a cause such as a history of rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease, prior chest irradiation, systemic illness that can induce valvulitis, or a family history of VHD, congenital heart disease, aortopathy, or premature sudden cardiac death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-coronary cardiac manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10779060\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiographic assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A transthoracic echocardiogram is indicated in patients with known or suspected valve disease, preferably prior to conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The echocardiogram is important to determine the type and severity of valvular lesions, the degree of left or right ventricular dilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dysfunction, and the presence of pulmonary hypertension or any other associated cardiac defects. In the setting of stenotic valve lesions, valve gradients may increase during pregnancy and should be interpreted accordingly. The severity of regurgitation may remain unchanged, increase, or decrease during pregnancy. Left ventricular systolic function is generally grossly preserved during pregnancy, though alterations in Doppler indices of ventricular function during normal pregnancy have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging as a risk stratification tool in pregnancy is most useful in women with VHD who have associated aortopathies (ie, women with Marfan syndrome and aortic coarctation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10779067\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise testing (with or without echocardiograms) or cardiopulmonary testing may aid risk assessment and can objectively estimate functional capacity, which is an important determinant of pregnancy outcome. An abnormal (blunted) chronotropic response to exercise has been associated with adverse outcomes in pregnancy in women with congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Exercise testing is useful in women with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis to quantify functional capacity and assess blood pressure response to exercise. In women with mitral stenosis who have symptoms out of proportion to the degree of valve stenosis, stress echocardiography can be helpful to examine changes in the right ventricular systolic pressure with exercise. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10779074\"><span class=\"h2\">Biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utility of cardiac biomarkers for risk stratification in women with VHD considering pregnancy is not described. Elevated levels of natriuretic peptides are reported during uncomplicated pregnancies of women with established heart disease, making interpretation difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Normal levels of natriuretic peptides may be useful in excluding cardiac decompensation in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Median brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels during normal pregnancy are approximately twofold those in nonpregnant controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], while median BNP levels in a series of pregnant women with heart disease were over twofold those in pregnant women without heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10779081\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Review of current medication use and dose will inform a discussion between the practitioner and patient on the benefits and risks of medication use in pregnancy. Some cardiac medications (eg, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) will need to be discontinued or substituted with an alternative drug if they are teratogenic or pose a risk for the developing fetus. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10779088\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTIONS PRIOR TO PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women with high-risk valvular heart disease (VHD) may require intervention prior to pregnancy to minimize risks or may be advised to avoid pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. High-risk lesions include severe symptomatic or asymptomatic mitral stenosis and severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. </p><p>Patients referred for valve intervention prior to possible pregnancy should receive prepregnancy counseling by a cardiologist with expertise in managing patients with VHD during pregnancy. This review should include a discussion of the risks and benefits of all options for transcatheter or surgical intervention, including mechanical prosthesis, bioprosthesis, and valve repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cardiac surgery should be avoided, if possible, during pregnancy. The maternal risks are approximately the same as those in nonpregnant women, but cardiopulmonary bypass during pregnancy poses significant risk for the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The decision is much more complex when a valve replacement is required and necessitates a detailed discussion on the risk and benefits of various valve options with the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In brief, the trade-off involves the risk of pregnancy-related thromboembolic complications and the risk of anticoagulant therapy with mechanical valves versus the limited durability of bioprosthetic valves. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with bioprosthetic heart valves who are hemodynamically stable and do not require anticoagulation generally tolerate pregnancy well. However, approximately 30 to 35 percent of heterograft prostheses and 10 to 20 percent of homograft prostheses fail within 10 to 15 years of implantation. Thus, women of childbearing age who have a bioprosthesis are likely to require at least one additional valve surgery during their lifetime. Although some studies suggested that valve deterioration is accelerated during or shortly after pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>], subsequent reports have not confirmed this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who require valve replacement prior to pregnancy, replacement of the aortic valve by a pulmonary autograft (Ross procedure) by an experienced surgeon is a potential option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, patients undergoing the Ross procedure face a risk of reoperation of 20 percent or more at 15 to 20 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-prosthetic-heart-valve-for-surgical-aortic-or-mitral-valve-replacement#H116779749\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of prosthetic heart valve for surgical aortic or mitral valve replacement&quot;, section on 'Ross procedure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of pregnancy is high for both the mother and fetus when a mechanical valve is present, largely due to risk of valve thrombosis and thromboembolism and the need for anticoagulation to prevent these complications. All anticoagulants are associated with increased risk of miscarriage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F115116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115116 \">table 1</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a>, which is the most reliable anticoagulant for prevention of thromboembolic complications in pregnant women, is associated with a risk of fetal defects (warfarin embryopathy) as well as increased risk of fetal loss compared with low molecular weight heparin. On the other hand, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> and low molecular weight heparin are associated with an increased incidence of mechanical valve thrombosis and thromboembolism. Another potential complication includes bleeding secondary to anticoagulation. These issues are discussed in detail separately.

If possible, prosthetic valve replacement should be avoided when valve intervention is required prior to pregnancy. </p><p>The alternative approaches for valve intervention prior to pregnancy vary with the valve lesion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balloon valvotomy is preferred to valve replacement for patients with mitral stenosis with appropriate valvular anatomy; however, open commissurotomy is required if valve morphology is not favorable or the patient has left atrial thrombus or associated moderate or more mitral regurgitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy for mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valve repair is the preferred surgical procedure in patients with mitral regurgitation with indications for valve surgery. If valve replacement is necessary, a bioprosthetic valve should be used when possible because long-term anticoagulation is not required (in the absence of atrial fibrillation). However, degeneration of bioprosthetic valves occurs after 10 to 15 years (depending upon the valve location); as a result, bioprosthetic valve replacement will be needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical procedures for severe chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic stenosis in young women is, in developed countries, almost always due to bicuspid aortic valve. Women with noncalcified valves can sometimes be treated with percutaneous aortic balloon valvotomy rather than aortic valve replacement.

However, we agree with the 2008 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association guidelines for the management of adults with congenital heart disease that suggest that in select high-risk patients, such as those with prosthetic heart valves, it is reasonable to consider antibiotic prophylaxis before vaginal delivery at the time of membrane rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the risk of postpartum endometritis is routinely given prior to all cesarean deliveries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 5</a>), and will provide protection against endocarditis as well.

In a 2014 review of the literature, 90 cases of infective endocarditis in pregnancy or postpartum were identified. The most common risk factors associated with infective endocarditis were intravenous drug use (14 percent), congenital heart disease (12 percent), and rheumatic heart disease (12 percent). Maternal mortality was 11 percent. However, most of the data came from individual case reports and are subject to publication bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H674174559\"><span class=\"h2\">Postpartum management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of postpartum monitoring will be dictated by the type and severity of the valve lesions and symptom status. The hemodynamic changes of pregnancy may not return to normal for as long as six months following delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. During this period, especially early postpartum, there is a continued risk of developing cardiac and obstetric complications. In view of the ongoing risks, we suggest monitoring women early (6 to 10 weeks) and late (four to six months) after delivery. These visits also provide an opportunity to adjust medications to pre-pregnancy dose scheduling if compatible with lactation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-valve-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H847843242\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
