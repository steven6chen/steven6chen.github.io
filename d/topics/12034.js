The characteristic pathologic feature that unites these disorders is the presence of linear deposits of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, IgM, or C3 in the epithelial basement membrane zone. The term ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) refers to mucous membrane pemphigoid that clinically presents as a chronic cicatrizing (scarring) conjunctivitis. Involvement of other mucosal sites and nonmucosal skin may also occur in OCP.</p><p>Left untreated, OCP eventually results in severe conjunctival scarring and visual loss secondary to keratopathy, with scarring and neovascularization. Thus, early diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy are essential for optimal management. The treatment of OCP involves the suppression of autoimmune conjunctival inflammation via the use of systemic immunomodulatory drugs. Conscientious ocular care to minimize the secondary consequences of chronic inflammation also is important.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of OCP will be reviewed here. Other forms of pemphigoid are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid-and-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2913448\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of OCP is estimated to be between 1 in 8000 and 1 in 46,000 ophthalmic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. No geographical or racial predilection has been detected.</p><p>OCP is primarily a disease of older adults, with an average age of diagnosis between the ages of 60 and 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. However, due to the nonspecific conjunctival inflammation that characterizes early stage OCP, in some patients the disease may be present for years prior to recognition of the diagnosis. </p><p>OCP appears to have a predilection for women. The female to male ratio is estimated to be between 1.5:1 and 3:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The occurrence of OCP in children is rare; as of 2011, less than 20 pediatric patients have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2913490\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chronic, cicatrizing conjunctivitis of OCP is a manifestation of a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by the aberrant production of antibodies that recognize normal components of the mucosal epithelial basement membrane zone. As in other forms of pemphigoid, the interaction of these antibodies with their target antigens is believed to precipitate the clinical manifestations of OCP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-bullous-pemphigoid-and-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several components of the basement membrane zone have been identified as potential antigenic targets in cicatricial pemphigoid, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta 4 peptide of alpha 6 beta 4 integrin (a transmembrane anchoring protein that links basal cell hemidesmosomes to the underlying basement membrane zone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laminin 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 (BP 180) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unspecified 168 kilodalton and 45 kilodalton antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]</p><p/><p>In particular, in OCP, the 205 kilodalton beta 4 peptide of alpha 6 beta 4 integrin appears to be a frequent target antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/9,10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,18</a>]. An epitope in the large cytoplasmic domain of the beta 4 peptide has the strongest binding affinity for autoantibodies in sera from patients with OCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A study has identified specific epitopes of beta 4 integrin that may be involved in the pathobiology of OCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In contrast to pemphigoid involving cutaneous surfaces, which typically manifests as disassociation of the epidermis and dermis (eg, blistering skin in bullous pemphigoid), in OCP the immune-mediated process manifests as a chronic, scarring conjunctivitis. The following sequence of events may contribute to the development of the clinical findings in OCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoantibody binding in the basement membrane zone stimulates an inflammatory cascade that involves the secretion of cytokines and the recruitment of inflammatory cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recruited inflammatory cells sustain inflammation through the secretion of additional proinflammatory cytokines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The release of profibrotic cytokines by inflammatory cells, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and interferon (IFN)-gamma contributes to the development of scarring </p><p/><p>The inciting factors for OCP are not definitively known. It is suspected that a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental insults contributes to the production of pathogenic autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The HLA DQW7 (HLA DQ-beta*0301) allele has been identified as a potential risk factor for OCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], and medications or microbial organisms may be relevant environmental contributors. </p><p>In a small subset of patients with OCP, a potential contributing factor is detected. Cases in which topical ophthalmic medications or systemic practolol have been linked to the development of OCP (also known as pseudopemphigoid or pseudo-OCP) have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/25-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-32</a>]. </p><p>In addition, intense conjunctival inflammation has been proposed as a potential inciting factor for OCP via a process referred to as epitope spreading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The epitope spreading theory describes the immune detection of normal host antigens during tissue inflammation and the subsequent mounting of an aberrant autoimmune response against those antigens. The development of OCP following Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been attributed to this theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether this is a legitimate pathway for the induction of OCP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2913497\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of OCP vary according to the stage of the disease. Extraocular involvement may or may not be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378742\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the time of initial symptoms, OCP may present with unilateral eye involvement. However, bilateral disease usually develops within two to four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/5,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35</a>].</p><p>Early disease may present only with signs of a chronic or relapsing conjunctivitis, with symptoms such as tearing, irritation, burning, or mucus drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65724\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65724 \">picture 1A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Frank vesicles on the conjunctiva are infrequently detected. </p><p>As the disease progresses, fibrosis ensues, resulting in conjunctival shrinkage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78279\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78279 \">picture 1B</a>). Symblephara (fibrotic adhesions between the bulbar and palpebral conjunctivae), which typically begin in the inferior fornix, can become so severe that they impair eye movement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54207\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54207 \">picture 1C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. As a consequence of scarring, some patients also may develop lagophthalmos (loss of the ability to completely close the eye). </p><p>Moreover, involvement of the eyelid margin can lead to ankyloblepharon (fusion of the lid margins of the upper and lower eyelids). Inflammation and scarring in this area may also disrupt the orientation of eyelash follicles, resulting in trichiasis (inward growth of the eyelashes) or distichiasis (a duplicate row of eyelashes in which one or both grow inward against the eye) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75647\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75647 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p>Visual impairment eventually occurs if OCP is not adequately controlled. Xerophthalmia leading to corneal keratinization occurs as a consequence of the destruction of the ducts of the lacrimal glands, the elimination of goblet cells, which produce the mucus component of the tear film, or the development of lagophthalmos. Additionally, direct trauma to the corneal surface in the setting of entropion or trichiasis contributes to corneal keratinization, neovascularization, and scarring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F66981\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66981 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378785\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Staging systems have been developed to assist in the assessment of disease severity and treatment response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/5,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,37,38</a>]. In 1986, we proposed the following categories for the classification of OCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stage I </strong>&ndash; Chronic conjunctivitis with subepithelial fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65724\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65724 \">picture 1A</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stage II </strong>&ndash; Shortening of the inferior fornix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78279\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78279 \">picture 1B</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stage III </strong>&ndash; Symblepharon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54207\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54207 \">picture 1C</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stage IV </strong>&ndash; End stage disease manifesting as ankyloblepharon, severe sicca syndrome, severe ocular surface keratinization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F66981\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66981 \">picture 3</a>)</p><p/><p>In the modified version of this staging system, stages II and III are further subdivided in to four groups that describe the degree of involvement (a = 0 to 25 percent, b = 25 to 50 percent, c = 50 to 75 percent, and d = 75 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. For stage II, the designation describes the percent loss of the inferior fornix depth, while in stage III this describes the percentage of horizontal involvement by symblephara. The number of symblephara is also noted. For example, a patient with stage IIcIIIb(2) would have an eye with 50 to 75 percent loss of the inferior fornix and 25 to 50 percent involvement by two symblephera.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378771\"><span class=\"h2\">Extraocular involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concomitant oral disease is common in patients with OCP. Oral lesions are estimated to occur in approximately 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Erosive gingivitis is the most common oral manifestation, but involvement manifesting as erosions or vesicles may also occur on the buccal mucosa, palate, alveolar ridge, tongue, and lip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Other mucosal sites affected less frequently than the oral cavity include the pharynx, nose, larynx, genitalia, anus, and esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Compared with oral disease, a smaller subset of patients with OCP has involvement of nonmucosal skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In one study from an ophthalmologic practice, 16 percent of patients had skin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Such patients most frequently present with inflammatory bullae and erosions on the head, neck, and upper trunk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2913529\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTABLISHING THE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The systemic immunomodulatory therapies required for the treatment of OCP are associated with a number of potential adverse effects. This, and the fact that the approach to treatment differs significantly from the therapeutic approach for some of the other disorders that clinically resemble OCP, strongly favor confirmation of the diagnosis whenever feasible (see <a href=\"#H378908\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). A conjunctival biopsy with immunohistochemical studies is a valuable tool for confirming the diagnosis in patients with clinical findings suggestive of OCP. However, clinicians must remain cognizant that inconclusive or negative results do not rule out the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2828114\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who have extraocular lesions, such as skin or other mucosal lesions, the tissue biopsy for diagnosis should first be attempted in these more easily accessible sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35</a>]. Conjunctival biopsies are generally performed in patients with active disease limited to the ocular mucosa or in patients in whom the disease is strongly suspected despite negative or inconclusive results from extraocular biopsies.</p><p>Conjunctival biopsies should always be performed on inflamed conjunctival tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Conjunctival biopsies may be obtained from a variety of sites; we typically biopsy the bulbar conjunctiva. The approach to cutaneous biopsies in patients with concomitant skin involvement is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid-and-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid#H554282\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid&quot;, section on 'Skin biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>Negative or inconclusive results can occur due to poor biopsy technique or poor handling of the specimen. Conjunctival biopsies should only be performed by ophthalmologists, and only experienced laboratory technicians should process conjunctival tissue. Disease exacerbation and the induction of scarring are potential risks of conjunctival biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2198362\"><span class=\"h3\">Hematoxylin and eosin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The findings in specimens stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) are nonspecific. Examination typically demonstrates an inflammatory infiltrate of variable intensity composed of neutrophils, macrophages, plasma cells, lymphocytes, and Langerhans cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F55683\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55683 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Squamous metaplasia may also be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68490\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68490 \">picture 5</a>). The performance of additional histopathologic stains facilitates the identification of other common features, such as decreased goblet cells (PAS stain) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F61302\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61302 \">picture 6</a>) and increased mast cells (Giemsa stain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H378882\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunohistochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct immunofluorescence should be performed on all conjunctival biopsy specimens. Linear deposition of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, IgM, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C3 is the characteristic finding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F74474\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74474 \">picture 7</a>). However, because the diagnostic sensitivity of direct immunofluorescence in most laboratories may be only around 50 percent, a negative test does not rule out the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p>The utilization of an immunoperoxidase assay may improve the likelihood of diagnosis, and the technique should be performed if immunofluorescence is negative in a patient with clinical features strongly suggestive of OCP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F82652\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82652 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In a retrospective study of 166 patients with suspected OCP, performance of an immunoperoxidase avidin-biotin-complex assay on specimens that yielded negative or inconclusive immunofluorescence results was associated with the detection of additional diagnoses of OCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The addition of the immunoperoxidase assay increased the sensitivity of testing from 52 to 83 percent.</p><p>Of note, immunohistochemical findings consistent with OCP do not definitively rule out all other possible diagnoses. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and linear IgA bullous dermatosis, both of which may involve skin and ocular tissue, present with similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, other diagnostic clues are utilized to distinguish OCP from these disorders. The presence of prominent milia formation in skin lesions and the detection of antibodies against type VII collagen via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting, or immunoprecipitation support a diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Predominant linear IgA binding at the basement membrane zone in combination with classic skin lesions resembling a &quot;cluster of jewels&quot; suggests the possibility of linear IgA bullous dermatosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2198445\"><span class=\"h2\">Indirect immunofluorescence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circulating antibodies against the basement membrane zone are less consistently detected in patients with cicatricial pemphigoid than in patients with bullous pemphigoid, and are of little value for diagnosis.

We aim to maintain the white blood cell count above <span class=\"nowrap\">3000/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> the absolute neutrophil count above <span class=\"nowrap\">1000/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> and the platelet count above <span class=\"nowrap\">70,000/microL</span>. When utilizing oral cyclophosphamide therapy we prescribe initial doses of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Prednisone (1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> is initiated at the same time as cyclophosphamide therapy. Once improvement is achieved, we taper the prednisone over the course of approximately three months. </p><p>As noted above, leukopenia is expected during treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and a complete blood count should be monitored weekly for the first two to three months of therapy and at least monthly thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Gastrointestinal distress, hemorrhagic cystitis, bladder cancer, infections, hair loss, and reproductive problems such as amenorrhea, premature ovarian failure, and azoospermia also can occur with cyclophosphamide. The drug is teratogenic and, thus, is contraindicated in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-toxicity-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General toxicity of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Due to the potential long-term effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, we limit the duration of treatment with cyclophosphamide to 12 months.

In a nonrandomized study of 16 patients with OCP, the administration of IVIG with gradual withdrawal of conventional therapy was associated with a shorter time to clinical remission compared with the time required in patients who were maintained on conventional therapy (4 versus 8.5 months). In addition, total control of disease activity was achieved in all patients treated with IVIG compared with only three out of eight patients who continued conventional therapy. Sustained remissions of 24 to 48 months have been reported after completion of IVIG therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Although the initial cost of treatment with IVIG can be limiting, a retrospective study in the United States that compared the cost of IVIG and conventional immunosuppressive therapy in patients with severe mucous membrane pemphigoid found that the overall cost of disease management was lower in patients treated with IVIG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ocular-cicatricial-pemphigoid/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>Adverse effects of IVIG include hypersensitivity reactions, headache, vasculitis, aseptic meningitis, renal failure, myocardial infarction, and thrombosis.

Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for the prevention of severe scarring and blindness. (See <a href=\"#H2913441\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OCP is a relatively uncommon disorder that preferentially affects older adults. Women are more likely to be affected than men. OCP rarely occurs in children. (See <a href=\"#H2913448\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of OCP is likely to involve the stimulation of an inflammatory response by autoantibodies that bind to normal components of the conjunctival basement membrane zone. The beta 4 peptide of alpha 6 beta 4 integrin appears to be a frequent target antigen. (See <a href=\"#H2913490\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical findings in OCP vary according to the stage of the disease. Disease initially manifests as a chronic conjunctivitis and progresses to conjunctival fibrosis manifesting and conjunctival contracture or symblepharon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65724%7EDERM%2F78279%7EDERM%2F54207\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65724 graphicRef78279 graphicRef54207 \">picture 1A-C</a>). Xerophthalmia (dry eye) and trichiasis (inward turning of the eyelashes) are additional common findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75647\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75647 \">picture 2</a>). Corneal damage resulting in visual impairment may also occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F66981\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66981 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2913497\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatments used for the management of OCP have multiple potential adverse effects, and confirmation of the diagnosis with immunohistochemical studies on biopsy specimens should be performed whenever feasible. The characteristic immunohistochemical finding is linear deposition of IgG, IgA, or C3 along the basement membrane zone. Negative direct immunofluorescence results are common and should <strong>not</strong> be used to rule out the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2913529\" class=\"local\">'Establishing the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with extraocular skin or mucosal lesions, initial biopsies for diagnosis can be performed at those sites. Conjunctival biopsies are necessary in patients with disease limited to the ocular mucosa or in those in whom the diagnosis is highly suspected despite negative extraocular biopsy results. (See <a href=\"#H2828114\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with known or suspected OCP require referral to an ophthalmologist. Whenever possible, patients should be managed by clinicians experienced in the management of this disease. (See <a href=\"#H464168\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic immunomodulatory therapy and eye care practices aimed at reducing the risk for scarring and visual impairment are the most important components of the management for patients with OCP. For patients with mild to moderate OCP, we recommend treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> based upon the evidence in support of its efficacy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

Topical therapy alone should <strong>not</strong> be used for the management of OCP. (See <a href=\"#H2913554\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H192070\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe, rapidly progressive, or refractory disease require aggressive treatment. We recommend treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). IVIG and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> are additional treatments that have shown promising results in early studies.
