We encourage the clinician to contact a regional poison control center or consult a medical toxicologist for all serious rodenticide exposures.

Rodents carry disease and affect food supply, and multiply rapidly when left unchecked. The process of eradicating rodent populations, however, is not without challenges. For example, rodents will avoid some toxic compounds by taste alone (primary bait refusal), will not feed twice on a substance that causes illness (bait shyness), and learn to avoid certain supplies of food or water if they cause death in other rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For this reason, one-dose rodenticides are often used because using a toxin that must accumulate after multiple feedings will kill only a fraction of target animals.</p><p>Moreover, finding an agent that is easy to spread, highly toxic to rodents, but low in toxicity to nontarget species (such as humans and domesticated animals) is not straightforward. An ideal rodenticide has the following qualities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It must be effective in small enough amounts that adding it to food or water supply will not cause bait refusal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It must not partially sicken rodents who ingest it, lest it cause bait shyness for future encounters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The manner in which it kills the rodents cannot arouse suspicion in the surviving animals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The substance should be specific to rodents in toxicity and less toxic to humans and domestic animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>The anticoagulant rodenticides best meet these criteria.</p><p>Rodenticides are utilized in a number of formulations, depending on the circumstances and location of use. Edible baits must be ingested by the target species, whereas tracking powders and contact dusts are picked up on the fur during transit and subsequently ingested during grooming. Edible solid baits may be in the form of pellets, wax blocks, or loose &quot;cereal&quot; baits, which can be mixed in with or sprinkled on food. Pellet baits are often used as a packet or sachet that remains fresh until opened by the rodent, as is seen with household anticoagulant rodenticides. Edible liquid baits are mixed with water and best placed in a dry area where they are likely to entice thirsty rodents. Extreme care is required in the placement of liquid baits to avoid ingestion by children and pets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352512621\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rodenticides account for approximately 0.5 percent of the approximately 2.3 million human exposures reported annually to regional poison control centers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The majority of these exposures involve long-acting &quot;superwarfarin&quot; anticoagulants, followed by bromethalin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, phosphides, and strychnine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Poisoning patterns in the United Kingdom are very similar, with a vast predominance of long-acting and warfarin anticoagulant rodenticides, followed by cholecalciferol, phosphides, and alpha-chloralose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Fortunately, the use of highly toxic rodenticide agents in these countries is largely restricted only to commercial exterminators. Thus, mortality from rodenticide exposure is low. </p><p>However, global rodenticide exposures vary widely. For example, according to national poison center data in India, zinc phosphide, barium carbonate, and aluminum phosphide remain the most common cause of household and agricultural rodenticide poisoning, and deaths frequently occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Illegal rodenticides must also be considered, as in the case of outbreaks of tetramine poisoning in mainland China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In the event that the exposure cannot be clearly identified, the practitioner evaluating a patient after rodenticide exposure should be aware of the regional differences in both household and agricultural pesticide use. Consultation with a regional poison control center can assist with identifying the likely rodenticide and is strongly encouraged. (See <a href=\"#H386040093\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352512628\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rodenticides or &quot;rat poisons&quot; refer to any product commercially available and designed expressly to kill rodents, mice, squirrels, gophers, and other small animals. Although toxicity varies widely among these agents, most rodenticides produce their toxic effect in humans by ingestion of a large single dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The most clinically helpful categorization of rodenticides utilizes the amount of poison that causes death in 50 percent of patients following exposure (lethal dose<sub>50 </sub>or LD<sub>50</sub>) and a corresponding &quot;signal word&quot;, which in some regions (eg, the United States) appears on the product label by law and reflects the highest possible toxicity of the product as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Highly toxic</strong> &ndash; LD<sub>50</sub>: 0 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> signal word &quot;<strong>Danger</strong>&quot; </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxic</strong> &ndash; LD<sub>50</sub>: 50 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> signal word &quot;<strong>Warning</strong>&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Less toxic</strong> &ndash; LD<sub>50</sub>: 500 to 5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> signal word &quot;<strong>Caution</strong>&quot; </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1747512816\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should make every effort to identify the specific rodenticide and the circumstances of the exposure to guide care. The clinician is encouraged to contact a regional poison control center to assist with identification and interpretation of rodenticide labeling. (See <a href=\"#H386040093\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1747513411\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify the poison</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional poison control centers are a valuable resource when identifying rodenticides and can be contacted in the United States by calling (1-800-222-1222). In addition, some hospitals have clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inpatient care. The World Health Organization provides a listing of international poison centers at its <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/poisoncentres/&amp;token=yqChGO0eHAjuA8dyAICLal0CT8YPG8QtJrxl7QlKGC0D0EV5AOJ5LfFhstsuSIaW&amp;TOPIC_ID=94398\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.</p><p>Proper identification of the rodenticide involves collection of the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location of ingestion </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rodenticide description (eg, appearance, color, and odor)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Packaging information </p><p/><p>Whenever possible, the rodenticide package should be inspected for the brand name, the full chemical name of the product, the &quot;signal word&quot; (eg, &quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;Warning&quot;, or &quot;Caution&quot;), and any other relevant warning labels, such as a skull and crossbones. Of note, the brand name alone is insufficient for correct identification of the rodenticide because it can correspond to several rodenticides sold by one manufacturer. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1747512896\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consultation with a regional poison control center <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical toxicologist is advised for clinicians managing symptomatic patients following rodenticide poisoning.

Thus, exposure to these agents usually warrants hospital admission to a unit with intensive care capability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who are asymptomatic after possible ingestion of highly toxic agents that do not cause delayed poisoning should undergo the following treatment:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastrointestinal decontamination as appropriate for the specific agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F97349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97349 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pertinent ancillary testing (eg, continuous electrocardiogram monitoring for barium carbonate, phosphide compounds, and phosphorus compounds; serum lactate and blood gas analysis for <span class=\"nowrap\">SMFA/fluoroacetamide;</span> serum calcium in patients possibly exposed to elemental phosphorus; serum potassium following barium carbonate exposure or phosphide compound ingestion; or glucose monitoring after Vacor ingestion).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Observation for a minimum of six hours after exposure. If the patient has any symptoms of poisoning or abnormal findings on ancillary testing, then hospitalization is warranted. Otherwise, these patients may be discharged home after six hours of observation, as long as the clinical picture is unchanged and the possibility of exposure to any delayed-toxicity agents such as thallium, arsenic, SMFA, or fluoroacetamide can be excluded. However, given the high toxicity of all of these agents, a low threshold for admission and observation is appropriate for exposure to any highly toxic rodenticide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other agents (signal word &quot;Warning&quot; or &quot;Caution&quot;)</strong> &ndash; Small ingestions of agents such as alpha-naphthyl thiourea, cholecalciferol, or anticoagulant rodenticides are unlikely to cause any toxicity.

Gastric lavage should not be performed in patients who have already vomited spontaneously.

Health care providers should ensure that all clothing is removed and soaked with water to prevent spontaneous ignition. Elemental phosphorus on the patient's skin should be copiously irrigated with water or saline. Wounds should be covered with saline-soaked gauze to prevent drying. White phosphorus particles embedded in wounds must be kept wet; particles will reignite if allowed to dry. Immediate surgical debridement is often necessary and repeated debridements may be needed to remove all phosphorus particles.

Acute arsenic poisoning can also result in QTc prolongation with subsequent torsades de pointes. In severe cases, patients may experience cardiac arrhythmias, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sometimes death. In some cases, acute encephalopathy can develop and progress over several days, with delirium, coma, and seizures.

In general, measurement of arsenic levels in urine is preferable to blood, since blood arsenic is cleared rapidly. In the emergent situation, a spot urine arsenic can be obtained prior to beginning chelation therapy.

A greyish, heat-stable, odorless powder, ANTU mixes easily with cereal or corn baits to induce respiratory failure after one feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. In target species, disruption of vascular endothelium causes rapid onset of pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.

Exploiting the rodent's specific vulnerability to small changes in calcium homeostasis, it causes death within two to five days from dehydration, organ calcification, and dysrhythmias. Because death is not immediate and it does not impart an unusual taste or appearance to food, it does not induce bait shyness, as is seen with phosphides, strychnine, and alpha-naphthyl thiourea. It is used by both the general public as well as commercial exterminators, and often sold in 30 g packs of pellets. One pellet contains approximately 2300 International Units (IU) of vitamin D.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vitamin D3 brings about hypercalcemia by promoting calcium mobilization from bone and increasing intestinal absorption. Although there are no human case reports of hypervitaminosis D from a rodenticide exposure, it is well described with vitamin D supplementation errors. Usually, human toxicity involves a chronic ingestion of &gt;50,000 IU daily. Calcium levels over 11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> cause anorexia, fatigue, disorientation, polyuria, vomiting, nephrocalcinosis, and renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-rodenticide-poisoning/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there is a history of only a small ingestion, no further evaluation is indicated. After a significant exposure (ie, daily dose &gt;50,000 IU) patients should be monitored for symptoms of hypercalcemia, and serum calcium levels obtained at presentation.
