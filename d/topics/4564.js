They serve as conduits that bridge severe stenoses or connect a territory supplied by one epicardial coronary artery with that of another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Collaterals therefore provide an alternative source of blood supply to myocardium jeopardized by occlusive coronary artery disease, and they can help to preserve myocardial function in the setting of a chronic total coronary occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Two classes of collateral vessels have been recognized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Capillary size collaterals, in which smooth muscle cells are absent, may be observed throughout the myocardium, although they have a predilection for the subendocardium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Larger, muscular collaterals, which develop from pre-existing arterioles, are typically located epicardially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINANTS OF RECRUITMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical and pathophysiologic determinants of collateral recruitment are poorly understood. Although primarily thought to be initiated by ischemia, appreciable collateral perfusion is present in some patients who do not have coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Studies of transient coronary occlusion during balloon angioplasty have found that the following independent clinical and angiographic variables are correlated with increases in collateral flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/4,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longer duration of angina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater level of long-term physical activity during leisure time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater lesion severity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal lesion location</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater duration of lesion occlusion</p><p/><p>Collateral recruitment may be diminished in older adults. In a study of over 1900 patients undergoing angiography within 72 hours after an acute myocardial infarction, the prevalence of collaterals decreased from 48 percent in patients &lt;50 years of age to 34 percent in patients &ge;70 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In addition, there have been studies determining whether there is a genetic association that can be found for the presence and development of coronary collateral circulation. The results have not been consistent, and at least one study did not find that functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in vascular growth were associated with coronary collateral circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying mechanisms by which ischemia induces collateral vessel formation are unknown. Several endothelial and smooth muscle cell mitogens have been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. As an example, markedly elevated levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have been demonstrated in the pericardial fluid of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting for unstable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In patients with coronary disease undergoing angioplasty, intracoronary concentrations of bFGF and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are associated with a directly-measured index of collateral flow; the concentration of VEGF is influenced by the degree of coronary atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, increased expression of VEGF has been shown in animal models of acute myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and in patients with an acute myocardial infarction; levels are higher in those with, compared to those without, improvement of left ventricular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. VEGF induces or stimulates collateral vessel formation and improves the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation of collaterals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; the induction of coronary collateralization by VEGF requires the production of nitric oxide, which is an important regulator of collateral growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Although suggestive, these studies do not directly prove a causative role for these molecules in the induction of collateral vasculogenesis. On the other hand, inhibitors of angiogenesis, such as protamine, interfere with collateral vessel development in dogs subjected to transient left anterior descending artery occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a canine model of collateral development, gradual occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery resulted in collateral vessel growth sufficient to provide approximately 80 percent of the blood flow to normally perfused myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although collateral vessel blood flow after epicardial coronary occlusion may be adequate to meet myocardial needs at rest, collateral circulation is generally <strong>not</strong> sufficient to meet myocardial demands during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and may not prevent myocardial ischemia during coronary occlusion. This was illustrated by one study of 450 patients, which found that 67 percent did not have enough collateral flow to prevent myocardial ischemia produced by balloon angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Quantitative radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography has added to the understanding of blood flow regulation in collateral circulation in humans. Applying this technique to patients with single vessel coronary occlusion, blood flow to collateral-dependent myocardium was shown to increase by nearly 35 percent during atrial pacing-induced tachycardia, a condition that increases myocardial oxygen demand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This degree of flow augmentation, however, was far less than that observed among normal controls.</p><p>The precise mechanisms underlying exercise-induced augmentation of collateral blood flow are not well understood. Coronary collaterals exhibit vasoconstrictor activity both early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], when vessels are thin-walled and nearly devoid of smooth muscle, and late, when vessels have developed further and have a thick muscular media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, endothelium-dependent relaxation is reduced early after the development of collaterals and may require up to several months to become normal, suggesting a possible increased propensity for vasospasm early after collaterals have formed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Endothelial release of nitric oxide&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and activation of beta-adrenergic receptors, whose existence has been demonstrated in collateral vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], may be responsible for vasodilation of coronary collaterals. In contrast, alpha-adrenergic receptors have not been identified in isolated rings of collateral tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Studies in animal models have shown that beta blockers induce vasoconstriction of coronary collaterals during exercise, thereby reducing collateral blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A similar effect can be induced by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and by a platelet activating factor that causes platelet aggregation and the release of the potent vasoconstrictors thromboxane A2 and serotonin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These observations may have clinical implications in patients with collateral-dependent myocardium, especially during episodes of ischemia and subsequent platelet activation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3158633880\"><span class=\"h2\">Changes in collateral vessel function over time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased antegrade flow through a collateralized coronary artery following successful percutaneous coronary intervention results in gradual regression of collateral function. In a study of 103 patients who underwent successful recanalization of chronically occluded coronary arteries, coronary pressure-derived collateral function dropped by 23 percent immediately following the intervention, and by another 23 percent during median five-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In this study, recruitable coronary collateral flow was best preserved among patients with larger collaterals. </p><p>One study compared temporal changes in coronary collateral function following coronary recanalization among 23 patients with acute occlusions and 74 patients with chronic occlusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].<sup> </sup>Notably, recruitable coronary collateral flow was greater in successfully recanalized chronically occluded coronaries compared with acutely occluded coronaries. Furthermore, among patients who received successful recanalization of chronically (but not acutely) occluded coronaries, those who had greater collateral recruitability (as determined by the collateral pressure index) had fewer adverse cardiac events during the follow-up period. </p><p>This study provides further evidence of a correlation between collateral vessel function and long term clinical outcomes.</p><p>Another study demonstrated that collateral recruitment as measured by coronary flow index improved in patients with stable coronary artery disease following four weeks of moderate or intense exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronary collaterals have been traditionally assessed using selective coronary angiography; this technique offers direct visualization of collateral vessels exceeding 100 microns in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coronary-artery-pressure-flow-measurements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coronary artery pressure flow measurements&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients undergoing angioplasty, the Doppler-derived or pressure-derived collateral flow index (CFI), which is defined as the ratio of flow during balloon inflation divided by resting flow, may be calculated. CFI is a useful measure for assessing the effects of various pharmacologic agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, on coronary collateral perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Pressure-derived CFI was shown to predict left ventricular dilatation one year following thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], making this measurement a potentially valuable clinical tool for prognostication.</p><p>Myocardial contrast echocardiography, which for this purpose involves the selective coronary injection of sonicated microbubbles, is an alternative diagnostic tool for the assessment of coronary collaterals. This technique may more precisely identify the spatial extent of perfusion via collateral vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved agents for cardiac imaging are contraindicated for intraarterial injection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast echocardiography: Contrast agents, safety, and imaging technique&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast echocardiography: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Myocardial contrast echocardiography and angiography appear to differ in their ability to detect the functional significance of collateral beds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/34,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,41,42</a>]. Surprisingly, there is a poor correlation between the presence of well-visualized collaterals at angiography and the preservation of segmental wall motion in patients with chronically occluded epicardial coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. By comparison, myocardial contrast echocardiography more reliably reflects wall motion in these patients, perhaps due to more precise delineation of microvascular perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Myocardial contrast echocardiography can also be used to predict functional recovery after revascularization of collateralized myocardium. In one series, for example, improvement in left ventricular function correlated with successful angioplasty of the infarct-related artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Among patients in whom angioplasty was successful, those with &gt;50 percent of the infarct bed perfused by collaterals, as demonstrated by myocardial contrast echocardiography, had superior baseline wall motion and wall motion one month following revascularization compared with those whose infarct beds were &le;50 percent perfused by collateral flow.</p><p>Other noninvasive techniques can assess the collateral circulation. The severity of 99m-technetium-sestamibi tomographic perfusion defects, for example, has been shown to correlate closely with absolute collateral flow as measured by radiolabeled microspheres in animal models of coronary occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and with collateral fractional flow reserve, an index of collateral flow in patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, thrombotic occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery results in downstream myonecrosis, with resultant segmental abnormalities of regional wall motion. Pre-existing collateral vessels have the potential to reduce the severity of injury by providing blood flow to the threatened segments.</p><p>Specific beneficial effects observed in the presence of collateral vessels include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced infarction size &mdash; In a canine model of electrically-induced left circumflex coronary thrombosis, infarct size as determined histochemically was smaller among dogs with contrast echo-detected collateral perfusion than among those without collaterals (4 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In the TIMI trial, infarct size, as determined by serum creatine kinase, was smaller among patients with collateral vessels compared to those without such vessels (20.6 versus 31.4 CK gram equivalents, p = 0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater postinfarction ejection fraction &mdash; Smaller infarct size should translate into a greater postinfarction left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. One study found that, in patients with sufficient collaterals, left ventricular recovery after reperfused myocardial infarction is primarily determined by the amount of collateral blood flow and is less dependent upon the time to reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In one series of patients with occluded culprit arteries after fibrinolytic therapy, the presence of significant collateral flow (as determined angiographically) was associated with a significantly higher postinfarction LVEF (60 versus 54 percent for those with lesser collateral flow) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Preservation of left ventricular function has also been observed following the late administration of fibrinolytic therapy to patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction who had a collateralized infarct-related artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced risk for rupture &mdash; The presence of collaterals can reduce the risk for rupture of papillary muscle, myocardial free wall, or interventricular septum.

In the study with the longest follow-up (median of 797 days), and which included 227 patients with STEMI, the presence of extensive coronary collateral flow before primary PCI was associated with a significantly lower mortality (4.4 versus 13.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p/><p>Indirect support for a long-term protective effect of an adequate coronary collateral circulation in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) comes from a study of 845 individuals with either stable (739 patients) or no important coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

In a small study of 22 patients, the administration of a serotonin receptor antagonist improved exercise duration and the double product at ST segment depression and reduced the severity of ischemia on radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging among patients with well-developed collaterals, but had no effect in those without collaterals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve the endothelial dysfunction seen in atherosclerosis, suggesting that they may have a role in angiogenesis. Support for this comes from a study of rabbits with hindlimb ischemia that found that quinaprilat, an ACE inhibitor with high tissue affinity, augmented angiogenesis to a degree similar as vascular endothelial growth (VEGF); <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a>, an ACE inhibitor with low tissue affinity, and placebo were ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-collateral-circulation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Statins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no strong evidence supporting the angiogenic potential of statin therapy.
