The emergency evaluation of children with acute abdominal pain and the evaluation and management of children with chronic abdominal pain are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-the-child-with-acute-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-to-the-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1237976058\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain is one of the most common complaints in childhood and one that frequently requires urgent evaluation in the office or emergency department. The cause is typically a self-limited minor condition, such as constipation, gastroenteritis, or viral syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The challenge for the clinician is to identify those few patients with abdominal pain who have potentially life-threatening conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65488 \">table 1</a>). The diagnosis is often suggested by the child's age and clinical features (ie, associated symptoms and physical examination findings). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Life-threatening causes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROLOGIC BASIS OF ABDOMINAL PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain receptors in the abdomen include visceral receptors (located on serosal surfaces, within the mesentery, and within the walls of hollow viscera) and mucosal receptors. Visceral receptors respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli whereas mucosal receptors respond primarily to chemical stimuli.</p><p>Visceral pain is usually poorly localized. Most visceral digestive tract pain is perceived in the midline because of bilaterally symmetric innervation. In some conditions, such as appendicitis, precise localization of the pain may develop once the overlying parietal peritoneum (which is somatically innervated) becomes inflamed.</p><p>Pain originating in the viscera may sometimes be perceived as originating from a site distant from the affected organ. Referred pain usually is located in the cutaneous dermatomes sharing the same spinal cord level as the visceral inputs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115623\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115623 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The neurologic basis of abdominal pain is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology of abdominal pain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3390666644\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most frequently encountered causes of acute abdominal pain in children presenting for emergency or primary care evaluation and their clinical manifestations are discussed below. The evaluation of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents, including the role of laboratory studies and imaging is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-the-child-with-acute-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of the child with acute abdominal pain&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE-THREATENING CAUSES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with abdominal pain who have sustained trauma must be carefully evaluated for intraabdominal injuries. Mechanisms typically associated with significant injury (ie, solid organ laceration or perforated viscus) include motor vehicle collisions, pedestrian struck by a motor vehicle, falls, sports-related injuries, and child abuse. Clinical manifestations of serious injury include abdominal bruising (eg, &quot;seat belt sign&quot;), abdominal distension, abdominal tenderness, and peritoneal signs (eg, abdominal wall rigidity, rebound, or guarding), or shoulder pain referred from diaphragmatic irritation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Appendicitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three most predictive clinical features of appendicitis are pain in the right lower quadrant, guarding, and migration of periumbilical pain to the right lower quadrant. However, at least one of these manifestations is frequently absent, particularly in younger children. Clinicians should therefore consider the diagnosis of appendicitis in children who have a history of abdominal pain and vomiting, with or without fever or focal abdominal tenderness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Intussusception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intussusception (invagination of a part of the intestine into itself, causing obstruction) typically occurs among children two months to two years of age. Although rare, intussusception may occur in older children, and is typically associated with a &quot;lead-point&quot; such as a Meckel's diverticulum. </p><p>Children most commonly present with characteristic pain that develops suddenly, is intermittent, severe, and classically accompanied by inconsolable crying with drawing up of the legs toward the abdomen. Bilious emesis may develop as the obstruction progresses.</p><p>Between the painful episodes, the child may behave normally. Initial symptoms can be confused with gastroenteritis. Lethargy or altered consciousness can be the primary symptom of intussusception, especially in infants. Although few children will have gross blood or currant jelly stool, most will have fecal occult blood. Presentations may be variable, however, with some children having no apparent pain or blood in the stool. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intussusception-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intussusception in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Malrotation with midgut volvulus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates may have emesis (bilious or nonbilious) with apparent abdominal discomfort as the result of midgut volvulus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78111\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78111 \">figure 2</a>). Over 50 percent of children with malrotation present before one month of age with this life-threatening condition. Among older children with volvulus from malrotation, the onset of symptoms is usually acute, but some children present with more chronic patterns of episodic vomiting and abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Incarcerated inguinal or umbilical hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with incarcerated inguinal hernias are usually irritable and crying. Vomiting and abdominal distention may develop, depending on the duration of incarceration and whether or not intestinal obstruction has occurred. On physical examination, a firm, discrete inguinal mass, which may extend to the scrotum or labia majora, can be palpated in the groin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;, section on 'Incarcerated mass'</a>.)</p><p>Umbilical hernias are common in young infants but rarely become incarcerated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-of-the-umbilicus-and-management-of-umbilical-disorders#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Care of the umbilicus and management of umbilical disorders&quot;, section on 'Umbilical hernia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Adhesions with intestinal obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with abdominal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting who have had previous abdominal surgery may have a small bowel obstruction (SBO) as the result of adhesions. Ischemic bowel injury may cause shock due to hypovolemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sepsis. </p><p>In retrospective series describing children who had abdominal surgery, 1 to 5 percent developed adhesions within five years of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Factors associated with the development of adhesions in these series included multiple procedures, peritonitis, and surgery involving the ileum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Necrotizing enterocolitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborns who develop necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a syndrome of intestinal necrosis, typically have vomiting, abdominal distention, and tenderness. Systemic signs include apnea, respiratory failure, lethargy, poor feeding, temperature instability, or hypotension resulting from septic shock in the most severe cases. Although the majority of affected infants are born prematurely, rarely normal term infants may develop NEC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Peptic ulcer disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) occurs less commonly in children than in adults, and may be complicated by severe hemorrhage or perforation. The clinical manifestations of PUD vary by age. Vomiting, hemorrhage, and perforation are more commonly seen in young children, while older children and teenagers have a presentation similar to adults consisting of epigastric pain, often occurring several hours after eating. Some cases of PUD are related to Helicobacter pylori infection, although this is also less common in children compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Peptic ulcers among children less than 10 years of age are often due to medications (corticosteroids or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) or major stresses. Approximately half of PUD cases are idiopathic in nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and management of peptic ulcer disease in adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Ectopic pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ectopic pregnancy must be considered in the diagnosis of abdominal pain for postmenarchal girls, as it may be associated with life-threatening hemorrhage. Risk factors include previous genital infection and previous ectopic pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82282 \">table 2</a>). Abdominal pain, amenorrhea, and vaginal bleeding are the classic symptoms, with or without rupture. The vaginal bleeding associated with ectopic pregnancy is typically preceded by amenorrhea. However, some adolescents may misinterpret bleeding as normal menses, and may not realize they are pregnant prior to developing symptoms associated with ectopic pregnancy. This is particularly true in adolescents who have irregular menses or who do not keep track of menstrual cycles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Uncommon life-threatening causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following unusual life-threatening causes of abdominal pain generally have other distinguishing clinical features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis</strong> &ndash; Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening condition that usually presents with polyuria, polydipsia, and glycosuria, but may also present with abdominal pain and vomiting, especially in young children. Patients with severe DKA may have altered mental status, Kussmaul breathing, and an appearance of marked dehydration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hirschsprung disease</strong> &ndash; Hirschsprung associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is an uncommon, fulminant complication of Hirschsprung disease. Children typically have explosive diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. HAEC can occur prior to surgical intervention, in the immediate postoperative period, or more than two years after definitive repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-complications-of-hirschsprung-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency complications of Hirschsprung disease&quot;, section on 'Enterocolitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemolytic uremic syndrome</strong> &ndash; Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) typically develops after an infection with Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) or Shigella (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75352\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75352 \">figure 3</a>). HUS has also been associated with pneumococcal infection, HIV, and genetic factors. Clinical and laboratory features of HUS include bloody diarrhea, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal injury manifested by elevated blood urea nitrogen.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-nephrotic-syndrome-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of nephrotic syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Bacterial infection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myocarditis</strong> &ndash; Myocarditis may cause abdominal pain as the result of passive hepatic congestion from heart failure or referred pain caused by pericarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnet ingestion</strong> &ndash; Case reports have described children who have developed volvulus and bowel perforation following ingestion of small rare-earth magnets. Injury occurs when objects become magnetically attached to each other across bowel wall. Symptoms are nonspecific and typically include abdominal pain.

In a series of 83 children presenting to primary care providers or an emergency department with acute abdominal pain, acute or chronic constipation was the most common underlying cause, occurring in 48 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In many cases, rectal examination was a key step in establishing the diagnosis.</p><p>Constipation is likely in children with at least two of the following characteristics: fewer than three stools weekly, fecal incontinence (usually related to encopresis), large stools palpable in the rectum or on abdominal examination, retentive posturing, or painful defecation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Associated features may include diarrhea and weight loss. Although the onset of symptoms for children with ulcerative colitis is usually subacute, a fulminant presentation with severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, tenesmus, and fever can occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Crohn disease in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Presenting symptoms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-mild-to-moderate-ulcerative-colitis-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pancreatitis</strong> &ndash; Pancreatitis generally causes acute upper abdominal pain (usually in the mid-epigastrium or right upper quadrant) at the onset, which may radiate to the back. Vomiting (that may be bilious) and fever also occur commonly. Causes of pancreatitis among children include trauma, infection, structural anomalies, and some medications (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tetracycline</a>, L-asparaginase, valproic acid, and steroids) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

It is more common after age seven years. The pain is often incapacitating, with or without vomiting and headache. A family history of migraine is common. Since this condition is a recurrent problem, there may be a history of similar presentations. The first episode must be differentiated from gastrointestinal and other non-gastrointestinal causes of acute onset abdominal pain. Physical examination may be normal or reveal mild abdominal discomfort. Blood work and imaging studies are usually normal.

As a result, patients are at increased risk of splenic torsion and infarction. Wandering spleen is most commonly seen in children and is associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, prune-belly syndrome, renal agenesis, and gastric volvulus. It typically presents with acute, diffuse, severe abdominal pain. Patients may also have an abdominal mass which is mobile to the left upper quadrant and may have an indented border. Ultrasound is most helpful in establishing a preoperative diagnosis and can assess adequacy of splenic perfusion. According to case series, approximately two-thirds of patients require splenectomy. Early diagnosis permits splenopexy and preservation of splenic function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Accessory spleens arise from incomplete fusion of the spleen during embryonic development and may occur in up to 30 percent of patients. Although typically asymptomatic, torsion of the accessory spleen on its blood supply can be associated with acute, acute intermittent, or chronic abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Wilms' tumor and neuroblastoma occur more commonly in infants, whereas leukemic or lymphomatous involvement of the liver, spleen, or retroperitoneal lymph nodes occurs more often in older children. Other causes include hepatic tumors, ovarian tumors, Burkitt lymphoma, and soft tissue sarcomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-the-child-with-suspected-cancer#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of the child with suspected cancer&quot;, section on 'Abdominal masses'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urolithiasis </strong>&ndash; Nonspecific abdominal pain is typical as a presenting feature of urolithiasis among young children. In comparison, adolescents are more likely to experience colicky flank pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Hematuria and urinary tract infection are other frequent manifestations of urolithiasis among children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Testicular torsion</strong> &ndash; Testicular torsion causes scrotal pain that may radiate to the abdomen. Patients may have associated nausea, vomiting, and fever. The affected testis usually is tender, swollen, and slightly elevated because of shortening of the cord from twisting. It may be lying horizontally, displacing the epididymis from its normal posterolateral position. A careful genitourinary examination should be performed in all males with abdominal pain, as the pain is often referred, and a history of scrotal pain may not always be disclosed by the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Testicular torsion'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ovarian torsion</strong> &ndash; Ovarian torsion typically develops as the result of an ovarian mass or cyst but may occur in isolation. Although more common in postmenarchal girls, it may be seen in premenarchal girls with an ovarian mass. Nausea and vomiting frequently occur. Partial or intermittent ovarian torsion typically presents as intermittent severe, adnexal abdominal pain associated with an adnexal mass.

Lead poisoning is usually the result of chronic ingestion and causes intermittent abdominal pain. By contrast, iron poisoning is typically an acute ingestion with other gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea.

These can include potentially life-threatening neurological effects (eg, seizures, coma, bulbar paralysis) and are associated with elevations in the porphyrin precursors delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). Symptoms usually occur as acute attacks, but are sometimes chronic.

Although the cause is typically a self-limited, minor condition, such as constipation, gastroenteritis, or viral syndrome, potentially life-threatening causes that require urgent treatment, such as appendicitis or bowel obstruction, must be promptly identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65488 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visceral abdominal pain is generally poorly localized. Once the parietal peritoneum becomes irritated (as occurs in appendicitis when the serosal surface becomes inflamed), pain may become more localized.
