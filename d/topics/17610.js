Prompt initiation of treatment for HLH is essential for the survival of affected patients.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of patients with HLH and the macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a form of HLH in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and other rheumatologic conditions, will be discussed here. The genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of HLH are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8905097\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW AND INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a progressive syndrome of unchecked immune activation and tissue damage. If left untreated, patients with HLH survive for only a few months, due to progressive multi-organ failure. In 1994, the Histiocyte Society organized the first treatment protocol for HLH (HLH-94), which dramatically increased this survival rate to 54 percent with a median follow-up of six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Often, the greatest barrier to treatment and a successful outcome for individuals with HLH is a delay in diagnosis. Several aspects of the clinical presentation of HLH contribute to this delay, including the rarity of the syndrome, the variable clinical presentation, and the lack of specificity of the clinical and laboratory findings. Diagnostic criteria for HLH are based upon those used in the major HLH studies, and therefore may be too stringent to capture all patients with HLH. Thus, treatment is appropriate for some who do not meet the strict diagnostic criteria but for whom there is a high degree of clinical suspicion for HLH. Any patient with suspected HLH should be seen by a hematologist, and those who are acutely ill should be transferred emergently to a facility where they can receive HLH therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H570591\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnostic testing'</a> and <a href=\"#H16456372\" class=\"local\">'Hematologist referral and pretreatment testing'</a> below.)</p><p>The goal of therapy for patients with HLH is to suppress life-threatening inflammation by destroying immune cells. Induction therapy based on the HLH-94 protocol consists of a series of weekly treatments with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a> (VP-16). Intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> are given to those with central nervous system disease. After induction, patients who are recovering are weaned off therapy, while those who are not improving are continued on therapy as a bridge to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). HCT will be required in those with an HLH gene mutation, central nervous system disease, or disease relapse.</p><p>In 2004, a new HLH protocol was initiated (HLH-2004). The major modifications were to use cyclosporin earlier (ie, during the induction phase of therapy), and to add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> to the intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Until the results of this trial are available, we prefer to treat patients with a regimen based on the HLH-94 protocol. (See <a href=\"#H22426855\" class=\"local\">'Initial HLH-specific therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no one parameter that drives the decision to start HLH-specific therapy. If a patient is clinically stable and the ferritin is consistently below 10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or rises from 1000 to 3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> with only slightly elevated D-dimer and liver enzymes, this author would not start treatment. However, if those two parameters became progressively more abnormal, early initiation of at least <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> treatment may halt the inflammation. Importantly, treatment should not be withheld while awaiting results of genetic or specialized immunologic testing. (See <a href=\"#H16456372\" class=\"local\">'Hematologist referral and pretreatment testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8905129\" class=\"local\">'Acutely ill or deteriorating patients'</a> below.)</p><p>The appearance of hemophagocytosis on serial bone marrow studies is not necessarily a sign of disease worsening. For patients who also have a triggering infection or rheumatologic condition, treatment of the triggering condition should be initiated simultaneously with HLH-specific chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H16456638\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8905161\" class=\"local\">'MAS/Rheumatologic conditions'</a> below.)</p><p>When HLH is triggered by an acute infection or other condition (eg, rheumatologic condition), treatment of the trigger is appropriate because this may remove the stimulus for immune activation. Patients who are less acutely ill and stable may be able to tolerate treatment of the triggering condition alone without HLH-specific therapy; this strategy may allow some patients to avoid potentially toxic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16456576\" class=\"local\">'Clinically stable patients'</a> below.)</p><p>Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a form of HLH associated with juvenile inflammatory arthritis (JIA) and other rheumatologic conditions. Patients with MAS represent a subset of those with HLH for whom successful therapy of the underlying condition may produce a good response and allow the patient to avoid HLH-specific therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H23116141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Rheumatologic disorders/MAS'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with malignancy-induced HLH require control of the HLH followed by treatment of the underlying malignancy. Unless the malignancy can be cured and the stimulus for HLH permanently eliminated, we perform hematopoietic cell transplant. (See <a href=\"#H22426855\" class=\"local\">'Initial HLH-specific therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16456454\" class=\"local\">'Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16456372\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMATOLOGIST REFERRAL AND PRETREATMENT TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid treatment of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is essential, especially for those who are acutely ill or clinically deteriorating. (See <a href=\"#H8905129\" class=\"local\">'Acutely ill or deteriorating patients'</a> below.)</p><p>If a clinician with experience using the agents required for the HLH-94 protocol is not available, transfer to another facility should be initiated immediately.</p><p>Despite the significant improvement in survival with the HLH-94 protocol, mortality with HLH remains high. Thus, clinicians are encouraged to enroll patients in clinical trials testing HLH therapies or other clinical or research questions. (See <a href=\"#H22426855\" class=\"local\">'Initial HLH-specific therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>We perform the following pre-therapy testing in all patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLA typing and search for an HCT donor &ndash; Patients with HLH gene mutations, hematologic malignancy, relapsing symptoms on or off therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> central nervous system disease will require HCT. Because the response to therapy is not known at the time therapy is started, all patients and appropriate family members should undergo HLA typing to facilitate identification of an HCT donor. Early initiation of HLA typing and selection of a donor shortens the pretransplantation interval, potentially improving the likelihood of survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If siblings are considered as potential donors, they should be tested for HLH gene mutations as well, to confirm that the donor does not have undiagnosed HLH. (See <a href=\"#H16456454\" class=\"local\">'Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac function &ndash; We also perform a baseline evaluation of cardiac function (ie, electrocardiogram and echocardiogram) prior to starting chemotherapy, because some patients develop cardiac complications from inflammation or chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease markers &ndash; It is important to be able to monitor disease response to therapy because treatment may need to be escalated if the patient is not improving. The distinction between chemotherapy toxicity and worsening disease may be difficult to make clinically. We do baseline immunologic studies (eg, soluble IL-2 receptor alpha [sCD25], soluble hemoglobin-haptoglobin scavenger receptor [sCD163]) as well as other markers of disease activity (eg, complete blood count, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, liver function tests).

The major triggering conditions are infection, rheumatologic conditions, and lymphoid malignancies. A search for these conditions can be undertaken in clinically stable patients, provided that the patient's status does not deteriorate.

If the patient is still febrile and has unchanged hepatomegaly, it is unlikely the laboratory parameters will be improving. Usually patients requiring salvage therapy will have a minor, or no, drop in ferritin levels, D-dimer, or liver enzymes. If the patient has improved clinical function, but unchanged laboratory parameters, the decision of changing to salvage therapy must be highly individualized.

Clinical worsening during induction therapy should also prompt a search for a new or previously untreated associated condition that could affect the patient's clinical status or trigger worsening of the HLH. For distinction between disease worsening versus infection or therapy-related toxicities, following disease markers can be especially helpful.

A relapse is typically signaled by the development of fever, organomegaly, and steadily increasing ferritin, D-dimer, and liver enzymes, with falling hemoglobin and platelet levels.
