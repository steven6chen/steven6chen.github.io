Myelomeningocele (spina bifida) is the most common NTD.</p><p>Myelomeningocele is characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column, with a corresponding defect in the skin so that the meninges and spinal cord are exposed. Because the neural tissue is exposed, it is also known as open spinal dysraphism, or spina bifida aperta. By contrast, occult spinal dysraphism is characterized by a cleft in the vertebral column, without a corresponding epithelial defect, and neural tissue is not exposed. There are many different forms of occult spinal dysraphism, ranging from asymptomatic vertebral anomalies to clinically significant defects in the spinal cord and related structures. Occult spinal dysraphism is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-spinal-dysraphism-pathogenesis-and-types\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closed spinal dysraphism: Pathogenesis and types&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The embryology and pathophysiology of myelomeningocele will be reviewed here.

The lateral edges of the neural plate become elevated to form the neural folds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These folds subsequently become further elevated, approach each other, and fuse to form the neural tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72061\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72061 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The fusion begins in the cervical region and proceeds in both the cephalad and caudal directions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81711 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The cranial neuropore closes on the 25<sup>th</sup> day after conception. Fusion is delayed at the caudal end of the embryo so that the caudal neuropore forms an open communication between the lumen of the neural tube (the neurocele) and the amniotic cavity. Closure of the caudal neuropore normally occurs approximately two days later. This process is called primary neurulation and forms all of the functional CNS, which extends to the mid-sacral levels of the embryo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Myelomeningocele is caused by a failure of primary neurulation (ie, failure of the spinal neural tube to close normally by 28 days after conception).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Occlusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After closure of the anterior neuropore, but prior to closure of the caudal neuropore, the neurocele (the embryonic central canal of the spinal cord) closes throughout its length. This process, termed occlusion, isolates the cranial vesicles, prevents drainage of fluid from the vesicles, and maintains them in a distended state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Approximately 48 hours later, after the caudal neuropore has closed, the neurocele reopens without loss of fluid from the cranial vesicles.</p><p>Maintenance of the distended cerebral vesicles is critical to normal development of the entire brain and cranium. Failure of the neural tube to close prior to reopening of the neurocele allows the cranial vesicles to collapse, and this is a mechanism for the development of the Chiari II malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The marked reduction in the intracranial volume results in a very small posterior fossa. The fetal cerebellum and brainstem then blossom into this small fossa. This causes the fetal cerebellum and brainstem to extrude inferiorly into the spinal canal and upward into the middle fossa. Surgical closure of the open neural tube during fetal life can diminish the severity of or reverse the Chiari II malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Chiari II malformation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Chiari II malformation (sometimes termed the Arnold-Chiari malformation, a misnomer) is characterized by downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils and medulla, in association with myelomeningocele. Associated abnormalities of the fornix and other structures in the fetal brain are probably responsible for the abnormalities in cognitive function that are frequently seen in individuals with myelomeningocele. The malformation obstructs the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the posterior fossa, causing hydrocephalus. Almost all patients with a myelomeningocele have the Chiari II malformation, and most have associated hydrocephalus.</p><p>These anomalies have important effects on the developing brain, which distinguish the clinical manifestations of myelomeningocele from those of traumatic paraplegia and other anomalies of the caudal spinal cord. They are the major cause of cognitive deficits, attention deficits, poor executive skills, stridor, and apnea displayed by many patients with myelomeningocele, and are also responsible for most of the increased mortality.

The four are distinct lesions and essentially unrelated to each other. Myelomeningocele is usually associated with Chiari II malformation, but may also occur in association with Chiari IV malformation, which consists of severe cerebellar hypoplasia.

In the human embryo, this process occurs in the caudal cell mass and forms the tip of the conus medullaris and the filum terminale. Because it occurs below the surface ectoderm, abnormalities of secondary neurulation produce lesions that are covered by skin, and are not involved in the pathogenesis of myelomeningocele.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs) (of which myelomeningocele is the most common) is highly variable and depends upon ethnic, geographic, and nutritional factors. It usually ranges from &lt;1 to 7 per 1000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The highest rates are found in China, Ireland, Great Britain, Pakistan, India, and Egypt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Within the United States, the rate is approximately 0.2 per 1000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]; rates are much higher in the Latino population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. They are higher in the East and South compared with the West. Girls are affected more often than boys. For a woman delivered of a child with myelomeningocele, the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is 2.5 percent (approximately 20 times the rate in the general population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Prevalence estimates for myelomeningocele in pediatric populations in the United States are proportionately lower, averaging 3.1 cases per 10,000 children and adolescents 0 to 19 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These estimates also vary by ethnicity, gender, and region. These prevalence estimates are lower than the incidence estimates quoted above, both because they do not include other types of NTDs and because prevalence is reduced by early deaths.</p><p>Rates of NTDs have declined where prenatal maternal serum screening programs for alpha fetoprotein and periconceptional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a> supplementation and food fortification (instituted in the 1990s) are practiced.

AFP screening is primarily intended for the detection of open myelomeningocele and anencephaly, but can also detect several non-neural fetal abnormalities. It does not detect skin-covered lesions (spina bifida occulta). When the serum AFP is positive, it is important to repeat the serum AFP, because repeat testing will be negative in many cases, and such findings are not associated with an increased frequency of false-negative NTD diagnoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management&quot;, section on 'Prenatal screening and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myelomeningocele can be detected before the 12<sup>th</sup> postmenstrual week by noting irregularities of the bony spine or a bulging within the posterior contour of the fetal back. After the 12<sup>th</sup> postmenstrual week, sonographic fetal markers for open NTDs include the lemon sign and the banana sign. The lemon sign refers to a concave shape of the frontal calvarium. The banana sign describes the posterior convexity of the cerebellum in the presence of spina bifida (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81929%7EOBGYN%2F64380\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81929 graphicRef64380 \">image 1A-B</a>). These changes result from the Chiari II malformation (ie, herniation of the cerebellum and brainstem through the foramen magnum). Other suggestive findings include ventriculomegaly, microcephaly, and obliteration of the cisterna magnum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound diagnosis of neural tube defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fetal surgery to repair myelomeningocele is offered at a few select centers. Fetal surgery is discussed in detail separately.

The diagnosis of myelomeningocele is usually obvious at birth because of the grossly visible lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55354\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55354 \">picture 1</a>). In approximately 80 percent of cases, the vertebral defect involves the lumbar and sacral region (including the thoracolumbar or lumbosacral area), which is the last portion of the neural tube to close. However, any segment of the vertebral column may be involved, and the defect typically includes the entire spine distal to the most proximal malformed vertebra.</p><p>At birth, the neural plate appears as a raw, red, fleshy plaque seen through a defect in the vertebral column (spina bifida) and the skin. A protruding membranous sac containing meninges, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and nerve roots is under the dysplastic spinal cord, which protrudes through the defect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy of the lesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An understanding of the anatomy of this lesion is important for surgical repair. The exposed neural tissue may be flat or elevated by a CSF sac below. Rostral to the open lesion, the spinal cord is closed. There may be an associated split cord malformation, in which case the dorsal portion of the spinal cord is only a hemicord, and the other portion of the split cord is ventral to the lesion.</p><p>At the superior margin of the lesion in the midline is a small opening that is the opening into the central canal of the closed spinal cord. If the sac has not ruptured, CSF from the central canal of the spinal cord can be seen coming out of this opening. Running caudally in the midline is the embryonic ventral sulcus. On either side of the sulcus are the motor plates with the motor nerves exiting from the ventral surface of these plates. The outer lateral tissues are the sensory (alar) plates and the sensory nerves enter at the lateral edge. At the lateral edge, the lesion is attached to dysplastic meninges and skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROLOGIC ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic deficits in myelomeningocele are usually present at birth, but may progress if complications such as hydrocephalus or tethered cord develop. Careful evaluation and monitoring of the neurologic deficits and identification of their anatomical origins is important to detect and prevent further deterioration of function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal cord</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neurologic deficits usually depend upon the level of the lesion, and typically affect the trunk, legs, bladder, and bowel. The deficits usually are severe, resulting in complete paralysis and absence of sensation. The bladder and bowel are affected in 97 percent of patients, resulting in urinary and fecal incontinence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract complications of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some segments of the spinal cord may retain some central connections and have partial function, resulting in voluntary control of isolated movements or the appreciation of sensation in part of the involved limbs. Often, the distal cord may retain some function, but the afferent pathways to the brain are disrupted. In this case, tendon reflexes or withdrawal to pain may be preserved, although voluntary control of movement and appreciation of pain are absent. Isolated reflex segments can be a problem because they often cause spasticity of the bladder and the muscles of the lower extremities. Aberrant connections in the involved spinal cord may result in unusual findings such as contraction of the contralateral limb when tendon reflexes are elicited. Markedly asymmetrical involvement of the lower extremities on physical examination usually indicates a split cord malformation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Brainstem</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with myelomeningocele have brainstem dysfunction, due to the Chiari malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. This causes problems such as swallowing difficulties, vocal cord paresis causing stridor, and apneic episodes. Strabismus and facial weakness can also occur. Most individuals with spina bifida will have an abnormal ventilatory response to respiratory gases. Weakness in the upper extremities and poor tone may also be caused by severe forms of the Chiari malformation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydrocephalus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ninety percent of newborns with spina bifida will have enlarged ventricles, indicating some degree of hydrocephalus. This is caused by the Chiari II malformation. The risk of developing hydrocephalus requiring shunting is lower among infants with sacral lesions, as compared with those with a higher vertebral level of involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Hydrocephalus often leads to multiple hospitalizations for shunt revisions and the complications of this procedure, and is the major cause of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Primary neurulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prenatal diagnosis of myelomeningocele is accomplished by maternal screening of serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) levels and the diagnosis is established by ultrasonography. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Chiari II malformation is a pancranial malformation that causes hydrocephalus and hind brain dysfunction. Downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils and medulla is just one of the abnormalities in this complex malformation. It occurs in almost all patients with myelomeningocele and is responsible for the cognitive difficulties displayed by many. The malformation can also cause brainstem dysfunction, with swallowing difficulties, vocal cord paralysis, and apneic episodes. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chiari II malformation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Brainstem'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with myelomeningocele usually have complete paralysis and absence of sensation affecting the lower extremities and trunk, depending upon the level of the spinal lesion. The bladder and bowel are affected in 97 percent of patients, resulting in urinary and fecal incontinence. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Spinal cord'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some degree of hydrocephalus occurs in most individuals with myelomeningocele. This is caused by the Chiari II malformation and is a major cause of mortality. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Hydrocephalus'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">M&uuml;ller F, O'Rahilly R.
