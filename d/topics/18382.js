Histologically, urticarial dermatitis is described by most pathologists as a &quot;dermal hypersensitivity reaction,&quot; a nonspecific reaction pattern that is seen in a broad range of skin conditions, including drug reactions, scabies, and the prodromal phase of bullous pemphigoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, in a subgroup of patients no underlying cause can be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158412161\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence and prevalence of urticarial dermatitis are unknown. It occurs most frequently in individuals older than 50 years, with a slight female predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158412168\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of urticarial dermatitis is incompletely understood. One hypothesis is that urticarial dermatitis is a lymphocyte mediated (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction. Clinical and histologic similarities have been noted between urticarial dermatitis and eruptions that occur in patients treated with anti-CTLA4 antibodies to break self-tolerance during immunotherapy for cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This finding suggests that urticarial dermatitis may represent a waning of the regulatory function of the immune system that allows a reaction to develop against a self-antigen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60029624\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathologic features of urticarial dermatitis are nonspecific and include a normal stratum corneum, mild epidermal edema with minimal spongiosis, and a superficial to mid-dermal perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils with occasional neutrophils (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97899\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97899 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A few basal apoptotic keratinocytes are sometimes present. Similar features may be seen in a variety of skin conditions, including drug reactions, arthropod assault, viral infections, and prodromal stage of bullous pemphigoid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158412176\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with urticarial dermatitis typically present with an extremely pruritic, persistent eruption of dull red papules coalescing into plaques, associated with areas of urticated erythema, sometimes accompanied by eczematous lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97654\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97654 \">picture 2C</a>). In contrast with urticaria, lesions last for more than 24 hours and often for many days or weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The eruption usually involves the trunk and extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97653%7EDERM%2F97652\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97653 graphicRef97652 \">picture 2A-B</a>). The palms, soles, and face are typically spared. Lichenification and excoriation from rubbing and scratching is commonly seen in affected areas.</p><p>The eruption follows a chronic relapsing course. Spontaneous regression is unusual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158412190\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the clinical and histologic features of urticarial dermatitis are nonspecific, the diagnosis is one of exclusion. A detailed history, including medication history, a complete physical examination, and additional testing (eg, complete blood cell count, direct immunofluorescence, skin scraping, patch testing) are necessary to identify possible triggers and exclude other skin diseases that may present with similar clinical and pathologic features. </p><p>Conditions that may present as urticarial dermatitis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prodromal bullous pemphigoid</strong> &ndash; In bullous pemphigoid, the development of bullae may be preceded by a prodromal phase characterized by intense pruritus and eczematous, papular, or urticaria-like skin lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F80385\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80385 \">picture 3</a>) that may persist for weeks to months or, infrequently, may remain as the only manifestation of the disease. The presence of any vesicles or blisters and the histologic finding of eosinophilic spongiosis and a mid- to deep-dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes and eosinophils suggest the diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a skin biopsy for direct immunofluorescence and serologic test for antibodies against the basement membrane antigens BP180 and BP230. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid-and-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scabies</strong> &ndash; Scabies can mimic urticarial dermatitis clinically and histologically. Clinical findings that favor scabies include an ill-defined eruption, more significant scaling, involvement of the hands <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feet, involvement of the male genitalia, and a history of nocturnal pruritus. On histology, scabies lesions show more spongiosis and a dense inflammatory infiltrate of lymphoid cells and histiocytes, with an admixture of eosinophils and plasma cells. However, in cases in which the two entities cannot be confidently differentiated, a positive response to empiric therapy for scabies has diagnostic value. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scabies-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scabies: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypersensitivity drug reaction</strong> &ndash; On histologic examination, the finding of interface dermatitis with presence of individual necrotic keratinocytes suggests a drug reaction. A history of exposure to a high-risk medication in the previous weeks further supports the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exanthematous (maculopapular) drug eruption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichenoid-drug-eruption-drug-induced-lichen-planus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lichenoid drug eruption (drug-induced lichen planus)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allergic contact dermatitis</strong> &ndash; Patch testing may be helpful to confirm or exclude allergic contact dermatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Occult malignancy</strong> &ndash; Urticarial dermatitis may rarely be the presentation of occult malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/2-4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,7,8</a>]. A complete physical examination with careful review of systems and age-appropriate malignancy screening may lead to the correct diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158412204\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urticarial dermatitis is typically refractory to treatment with topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, and UVB phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Systemic corticosteroids, either oral or parenteral, are rapidly effective in reducing pruritus and skin inflammation, although recurrence is common as the dose is tapered. Other systemic immunosuppressive agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, have also been reported as effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/4,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60029734\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of underlying conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients in whom the etiology of urticarial dermatitis has been determined, appropriate treatment of the underlying condition should be instituted in conjunction with the symptomatic treatment discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of bullous pemphigoid&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scabies-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scabies: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If a drug hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, all medications that are not essential should be withdrawn. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exanthematous-maculopapular-drug-eruption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exanthematous (maculopapular) drug eruption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158412211\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with urticarial dermatitis, systemic corticosteroids are the first-line therapy to achieve rapid relief from the unremitting pruritus. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> is initiated at 40 mg per day; this dose is maintained for one week and then tapered down over four weeks to 10 mg every other day or to the lowest dose that maintains symptomatic relief. </p><p>Intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide given as single 40 mg intramuscular injection at intervals of three to six weeks may be an alternative to oral corticosteroids. In patients with body weight over 100 kg, 80 mg may be given. This treatment can be repeated up to three to four times.</p><p>Most patients experience a prompt recurrence of symptoms when corticosteroids are discontinued or tapered. To avoid a prolonged therapy with systemic corticosteroids, systemic immunosuppressive agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>) can be initiated prior to discontinuing corticosteroids. The author prefers mycophenolate mofetil over azathioprine and methotrexate because of its favorable side effect profile.</p><p>After determining the lowest corticosteroid dose necessary to control symptoms, the author initiates <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in two divided doses. Treatment is continued at the same dose for at least two months and then corticosteroids are discontinued. If symptoms do not recur in the two months following corticosteroid discontinuation, mycophenolate is tapered off. The dose can be reduced by 500 mg per day every two to three months. If there is a relapse, the last effective dose is resumed.</p><p>Data on the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of urticarial dermatitis trials are scanty. Their use is based upon limited evidence from small observational studies and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/3,4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H158412218\"><span class=\"h2\">Second-line therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> may be used as second-line steroid-sparing agents. Methotrexate is initiated at a weekly dose of 10 to 15 mg in conjunction with the lowest dose of corticosteroids that controls symptoms. Corticosteroids are discontinued after four weeks. If there is no relapse in the following two months, the weaning of the methotrexate is initiated, with a dose reduction of 2.5 mg per week every two to three months. In case of relapse, the last effective dose is resumed.</p><p>Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> has been reported as an effective therapeutic option for urticarial dermatitis in a series of 50 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients were started on an average dose of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for at least two weeks. Cyclosporine was then gradually tapered over the subsequent weeks and then discontinued. No relapses were observed. In the author's experience, cyclosporine given at a dose of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day is effective in inducing a rapid improvement of symptoms. However, patients typically need treatment for 6 to 12 months before cyclosporine can be discontinued without a relapse. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a> is given at a starting dose of 2 to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in patients with normal levels of thiopurine methyltransferase. Corticosteroids are discontinued after eight weeks and azathioprine subsequently tapered off with a dose reduction of 50 mg per day every two to three months.</p><p>It is important to remember that approximately 2 percent of patients who initiate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> will experience a potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction in the first weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urticarial-dermatitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, the author only uses this agent if the patient has already failed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>.
