ID is heterogeneous and encompasses a broad spectrum of functioning, disability, and strengths. ID is an important public health issue because of its prevalence and the need for extensive support services. Its management requires early diagnosis and intervention, coupled with access to health care and appropriate supports that lessen disability and optimize progress in functioning.</p><p>The management, outcomes, and prevention of ID are discussed here. Other aspects of ID are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H723956459\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following terms are used throughout this topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intellectual disability</strong> &ndash; Intellectual disability (ID) is a state of functioning that begins in childhood and is characterized by limitations in intelligence and adaptive skills. The term replaces and improves upon the older term of &quot;mental retardation.&quot; A variety of other terms are used outside of the United States to describe ID (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57206 \">table 1</a>). The severity of ID is defined according to the level of support needed to address impaired adaptive functioning. Standardized intelligence quotient testing is no longer used to classify severity of impairment in ID.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Global developmental delay</strong> &ndash; Global developmental delay (GDD) is the preferred term to describe intellectual and adaptive impairment in children &lt;5 years old, based on failure to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning. Not all children with GDD will meet criteria for ID as they grow older. The term ID usually is applied to children &ge;5 years old, when the clinical severity of impairment is more reliably assessed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall goals of the management of ID are to strengthen areas of reduced function, provide ongoing family support, prevent or minimize further deterioration in the child's cognitive-adaptive function relative to peers, and promote optimal individual functioning in society. Interventions should begin early and be sustained. Goals should be appropriate and achievable.</p><p>The approach should be collaborative and multidisciplinary. During adolescence, an emphasis should be placed on vocational goals, including social adaptation, and vocational professionals should be part of the multidisciplinary team.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with ID require ongoing health surveillance similar to typically developing children. The multidisciplinary team should monitor developmental, academic, and psychosocial progress, explain functional profiles to the family, and advise regarding appropriate supports. The clinicians should also consider other developmental deficits, neurodevelopmental disorders, and coexisting conditions that impact functioning. It is important to recognize that children with ID can make progress in learning and communication, and can attain functional gains with appropriate supports. Most ID is mild in severity, and these children are able to achieve greater developmental progress compared with those with severe ID. Children with mild ID progress at one-half to two-thirds of that of the general population, while individuals with severe ID gain developmental skills more slowly, at one-quarter to one-third of what is generally anticipated.</p><p>Most individuals with ID require a broad range of interventions that should be applied early to improve short-term and long-term outcomes, including the following services:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speech and language therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupational therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy and rehabilitation, including mobility and postural support</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family counseling and support</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral intervention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educational assistance</p><p/><p>Evaluation of nutritional status by a dietitian may be helpful to ensure a well-balanced diet. However, there is no evidence that dietary or other alternative treatments (eg, high doses of fat-soluble vitamins) are effective, and these should be avoided because excessive doses can have toxic effects.</p><p>Vigilant surveillance should be maintained to detect and prevent manipulation, abuse, and neglect of the child with ID. Tools such as the Family Psychosocial Screen may be helpful to screen families for concerns of abuse and maternal depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Parent support, information, and advocacy are available through community organizations such as <a href=\"http://www.thearc.org/&amp;token=T4slFgMKaJb+0Y4X17Zdcqkdf9JVrPQMyVgAr7XlZ4c=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6191\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The Arc</a> (formerly Association for Retarded Citizens), Family-to-Family Health Information and Education Centers, <a href=\"http://www.autism-society.org/&amp;token=0e64WmB8Y+9YkspAK0sxMK1BeZkLoCkLMdGKhCuKOZ9n7KTWZlQiQEjERt5SQjqK&amp;TOPIC_ID=6191\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Autism Society of America</a>, and support groups corresponding to specific genetic syndromes or conditions (eg, Fragile X, Down syndrome). Such organizations and other forms of community participation can help to support positive social relationships for a child with ID and his or her family.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a treatable underlying cause of ID is identified, it should be promptly treated. Conditions in which further disability can be prevented include phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism, and hydrocephalus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-phenylketonuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of phenylketonuria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-in-children-physiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocephalus in children: Physiology, pathogenesis, and etiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82408915\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring for associated disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous neurodevelopmental, psychiatric, medical, and physical conditions are commonly associated with ID. Care should be taken to promptly identify and treat these conditions (if warranted). Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health problems</strong> &ndash; Disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety are common in children and adolescents with ID. Some affected individuals may also be at increased risk for suicidal ideation and substance abuse as compared with typically developing peers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs#H167151327\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;, section on 'Other neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health problems'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obesity</strong> &ndash; Overweight and obesity more commonly impact youth with ID than their typically developing peers; the risk increases with increasing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Risk factors that predispose to obesity include altered or inappropriate eating habits, underlying genetic syndromes, less physical activity, chronic health conditions, and psychotropic medication use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Children with ID should be monitored with serial measures of weight, height, and body mass index (BMI), and by review of risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-evaluation-of-the-obese-child-and-adolescent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical evaluation of the obese child and adolescent&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep disorders</strong> &ndash; Sleep disorders frequently occur in children with ID and can affect attention and learning. Initial approaches to address sleep problems include addressing important medical problems (eg, obstructive sleep apnea [OSA]), implementing appropriate sleep hygiene, providing a supportive routine, and avoiding inadvertent reinforcement of undesirable behaviors (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-sleep-problems-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral sleep problems in children&quot;</a>). Individuals with ID due to a specific genetic condition may have a characteristic sleep disorder. For example, children with Smith-Magenis syndrome may have insomnia, and those with Prader-Willi or Down syndrome are at risk for OSA. These children usually require evaluation with polysomnography and sleep-related behavior interventions and counseling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22#H86262802\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microdeletion syndromes (chromosomes 12 to 22)&quot;, section on '17p11.2 deletion syndrome (Smith-Magenis syndrome)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lead poisoning</strong> &ndash; Although lead toxicity is an uncommon cause of ID in the United States, children with ID are at increased risk for lead exposure; this is partly because children progress more slowly in development and spend longer in stages where mouthing behavior is common. Potential sources of lead exposure may include dust, paint, water, toys or other objects, ethnic remedies, or food containers.

This should include interventions to improve dental hygiene and gingival health, reduce bruxism (teeth grinding), and prevent dental trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An array of orodental pathologies can contribute to behavioral disturbances children with ID, or be a missed cause of pain in an impaired child.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavior intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with ID benefit from interventions to improve socialization skills and behavioral functioning. These should be individualized and applied consistently to support appropriate thinking, expression, behavior, and adaptive functioning.</p><p>Behavior management techniques are selected according to the child's displayed problem behavior or a desired behavior, and the child's responsiveness to management techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The function served by a child's problem behavior (for example, expressing frustration or need), its antecedent triggers, and the reaction of others (such as inadvertent reinforcement of undesirable behavior) should be considered along with the developmental level of functioning of the child with ID. Possible environmental factors or underlying medical causes of misbehavior should be considered and addressed (for example, child abuse, or a middle ear infection, or dental caries occurring in a child with impaired language and communication). Desirable behaviors should be positively reinforced, and restraining or punitive aversive approaches should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Interventions should be appropriate to the child's level of functioning (particularly language functioning) rather than chronological age. Specific techniques may include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intervention to reduce identified antecedents (triggers) of problem behaviors. This may include modification of the child's environment, eg, providing a child with more space (when an interfering behavior occurs in the context of close proximity) or reducing noise (where noise is the trigger), while providing a positive consistent schedule with individualized support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reinforcement of acceptable behavior by providing positive attention (&quot;time in&quot; attention) or desired reinforcer (appropriate treat or preferred activity).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purposeful &quot;ignoring&quot; of behaviors to encourage their non-use (as long as the behavior is not dangerous).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redirecting attention to extinguish problem behaviors (eg, pointing out something of particular interest when a problem behavior appears imminent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reinforcing behaviors incompatible with problem behaviors (eg, placing hands in an appropriate position or activity that replaces their use in a problem behavior).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prompt removal of the child from an activity when a targeted problem behavior occurs (&quot;time out&quot;).</p><p/><p>Behavioral goals and psychotherapy interventions for the child and family should focus on enhancing understanding of the child and their disability within the context of the child's functioning and environment, aiming to reduce the effect of disability and increase adaptive functioning. Other relevant goals include the positive use of strengths, building social skills and problem solving, self-esteem, communication, and independence. Secure emotional attachment, parental warmth, and communicative social interactions are important early goals; strategies to care for mothers of children with ID are important, as they are at increased risk of stress and psychiatric disorder (such as depression), which can further impact the child and family.</p><p>Interventions should be pertinent to the child's needs and abilities, behavioral phenotype, antecedents, psychiatric disorder, and child-school-family environmental needs, perceptions, and expectations. Promotion of good self-esteem and independence improves quality of life and reduces unwanted behaviors. The child should also be taught how to resist peer pressure and avoid exploitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For adolescents, individualized teaching should include issues of sexuality, transition to adult life, genetic advice, and preparation for independent community living. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Transition planning'</a> below.)</p><p>Group psychotherapy may be a useful adjunct to individualized sessions for school-aged children who have sufficient communication and cognitive functioning to participate in a group setting; a minimum of six or seven years age-equivalent functioning is usually required. In general, this should be part of a comprehensive treatment program and involves a trained therapist working in a community setting, with techniques adapted for the developmental skill level. Group therapy is most useful for adolescents and particularly for training in social skills.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Other neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, depression, and anxiety are common in children and adolescents with ID. Interventions for these disorders include family counseling, education, behavior interventions designed to address a specific type of neurodevelopmental disorder in the child (eg, ADHD or autism spectrum disorder), and psychopharmacologic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Interventions must be appropriate to the child's developmental level of functioning and diagnoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some psychiatric behaviors, such as aggression or self-injury, may place the child or others at risk of imminent harm. These require emergent evaluation to exclude medical and environmental causes such as hypoxia, pain, toxins, infection, and abuse or trauma, and may need medication, temporary restraint, or hospitalization.</p><p>Although most children with ID can be successfully helped by appropriate behavioral approaches and environmental manipulation, some require pharmacologic treatment. Psychopharmacologic therapy is more likely to be used in boys with ID than in girls with ID, and in children who have a comorbid neurodevelopmental disorder (in addition to their ID) or whose ID is severe. When needed for an individual with ID, a single medication is generally more likely to be used than multiple medications. For example, youth with ID are often treated with a stimulant medication (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylphenidate</a>), an atypical antipsychotic medication (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a>), or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluoxetine</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. However, medication selection depends on many factors that include patient needs and complexity; more complex comorbidities can require the use of multiple medications.</p><p>Appropriate use of medication, when indicated, can improve the child's mental health, participation and functioning, and secondarily reduce the burden of care upon caregivers. As an example, children who have ADHD in addition to ID often benefit from a stimulant (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylphenidate</a>), and those who display disruptive behaviors can benefit from treatment with an atypical antipsychotic drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a>). However, medications are typically considered only after initial adequate appropriate behavioral intervention, so as to minimize the risk and unnecessary use of medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Because the evidence base for making general psychopharmacologic recommendations in young children with ID is relatively limited, a carefully considered therapeutic trial may be indicated to assess whether a therapy is successful in an individual patient. Efforts should be made to enable older individuals with ID to participate in decision-making about their treatment. Pharmacotherapy of children with autism spectrum disorders is detailed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-pharmacologic-interventions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents: Pharmacologic interventions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of medications should be part of a clear comprehensive psychosocial treatment plan that includes behavioral baseline functioning, identified target behaviors, goals, and evidence-based intervention appropriate to the diagnosis and target behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Prior to prescribing medication, patients with irritability, aggression, self-injury, or disruptive behavior should be evaluated for other possible causes, such as underlying medical or psychiatric disorders or abuse, and coexisting conditions identified. It is important to consider individual and family risk factors (such as cardiac disease, sudden adverse events, seizures, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia), and potential drug interactions when making treatment decisions. Prior to initiating pharmacotherapy, the clinician and caregivers should agree upon measurable goals and target behaviors. Collaboration with other health care providers and observation for complicating side effects are important. For example, a drug-related movement disorder can present unpredictably and at varying times, such as when antipsychotic medication treatment has begun, is maintained, or is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Caution should be exercised in planning psychopharmacologic treatments for a child who has ID and epilepsy. For these children, medication decisions should consider potential drug interactions and adverse effects, the child's comorbidities (such as ADHD or depression) or their development during treatment (such as iatrogenic depression developing during antiepileptic treatment); and follow-up care includes careful medication titration to the lowest effective dosage, safe administration to avoid accidental overdose, and monitoring of the individual's seizure burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Although some psychopharmacologic agents can lower the seizure threshold, significant deterioration in seizure control is uncommon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-initial-treatment-and-monitoring#H1539286365\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in children: Initial treatment and monitoring&quot;, section on 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'</a>.)</p><p>Potential adverse effects must be weighed against possible benefits in treatment decisions. Medications that control behaviors can have negative effects on attention, concentration, learning, and quality of life, and can cause a drug-related movement disorder which can be temporary or may persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Idiosyncratic responses to medication are possible. For example, patients with ID may have increased sensitivity to the disinhibiting effects of sedative-hypnotics, and children with Down syndrome may be especially sensitive to anticholinergic medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Psychotropic medications can promote weight gain, particularly atypical antipsychotic treatment (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">risperidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clozapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">quetiapine</a>), but also antidepressants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">imipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amitriptyline</a>), mood stabilizers, or anticonvulsants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. A child's genetic condition can predispose to weight gain as well (eg, Down syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome). Options for preventing and treating obesity associated with psychotropic drugs include lifestyle intervention (optimizing diet and physical activity), avoidance or withdrawal of a particular drug, or substitution with a medicine less likely to promote weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A child psychiatrist, child neurologist, or developmental pediatrician can help guide psychopharmacologic management, especially where there are multiple complex disorders that need treatment and multiple treatment agents are being considered. Clinicians are advised to apply baseline and serial evaluations with awareness of practice parameters as they are developed. For example, appropriate monitoring for a child treated with an atypical antipsychotic medication includes serial measurements of weight, height, BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, and evaluation for abnormal involuntary movements, as well as fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, and electrocardiogram as appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, monitoring protocols may need to be modified according to the individual patient's clinical characteristics. The safest, most effective treatment at lowest possible dose is aimed for beginning with a low initial dose and slowly increasing (&quot;start low, go slow&quot;), monitoring the patient's response before making dose adjustments. Ideally, medication regimes should be simple, using the fewest possible doses. Follow-up evaluations should be made at least every three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the absence of a positive response to the medication, the accuracy of the diagnoses should be reconsidered, along with factors such as compliance with medications and treatment effects on targeted symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Residential setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the majority of individuals with ID live in integrated community settings rather than in specialized residential care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Other children who may be at risk of developmental delay include low birth weight infants or those with prenatal exposure to illicit drugs. Early intervention provides evaluation and individualized comprehensive services that support the early learning and functional progress of children with ID and minimize the effects of their disabilities; preventive measures to avoid secondary disabilities are included.

IDEA requires the states to identify and evaluate eligible children and generate an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) annually, with measurable and appropriate goals.</p><p>The legislation includes due process so that parents may participate actively in their child's education. Requirements for the participation of physicians and the extent of their participation vary among states. When it is not required by the state, parents may choose to obtain a physician's evaluation and assessment for developmental and other associated conditions and to identify medical needs and interventions. It is often helpful for the child and family to have a physician advocate who can act as an intermediary with state agencies.</p><p>Special education services offered by the school may include training in social skills, assistance in self-help, vocational training, behavioral assistance, and academic program modifications. Children may be placed in a special education class or provided resource classes or an aide. Principles of least restrictive environment and inclusion must be applied to enable a child with ID to participate in home or community settings among children who do not have a disability. Not all children can participate in regular academic classes, but, depending upon the extent of disability, they may be included in many other activities such as home room, physical education, lunch, recess, art, or music. Assistive technology options can reduce the effect of the disability and improve functioning in communication, daily living, mobility, communication, education, and vocational preparation.</p><p>Other educational settings are available for children who are unable to attend regular classes. These include a self-contained special education class with adaptive, self-help life skills training, a specialized day school, or, in rare cases, a residential institutional placement. The state is responsible for reimbursement, and the extent of the school's responsibility for related services, such as nursing, is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>According to the IDEA Improvement Act of 2004, after 16 years of age, an Individualized Transition Plan must be included in the student's annual IEP. This includes vocational planning and provisions for including the patient in decision-making, when possible. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Transition planning'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcome for ID is variable and depends upon multiple factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity level &ndash; Individuals with mild ID have a greater capacity to progress than those with more severe ID, and usually attain more learning, speech and language, reading, interpersonal communication, and vocational skills than individuals with severe ID. Appropriate provision of services helps to support functional gains attained by children with mild ID, in addition to providing for more severely affected children. However, other conditions that coexist with ID contribute to variable outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cause of ID &ndash; Known genetic causes of ID may be associated with an anticipated range of functions and outcome (eg, Down syndrome), or characteristic course (such as Rett syndrome). Most causes of ID do not result in progressive deterioration in function, but some genetic and metabolic causes are expected to cause progressive worsening in function (eg, San Phillippo syndrome). In other cases, cognitive deterioration from other causes can complicate the management of ID (eg, when a patient with ID has an accidental brain injury or develops Alzheimer disease). Establishing an accurate genetic diagnosis can be helpful to establishing a prognosis and guiding medical management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coexisting conditions &ndash; Clinical impairment profiles of children with ID and concurrent conditions vary and influence outcomes. Impaired vision or hearing, motor deficits, or some seizure disorders, can further limit long-term functional outcomes. Concurrent neurodevelopmental disorders other than ID (eg, autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) also may further impair a child's functioning and progress. In a child with cerebral palsy, gross motor impairment is the primary determinant of mobility outcomes, but cognitive impairment is an important determinant of performance of activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Other factors may also impact the course and resulting functions in ID, such as associated behavioral difficulties, substance abuse, obesity, depression, suicidal ideation and attempt, limited understanding of risk and accidents, neglect, abuse, or harm perpetrated by others. Treatment of coexisting conditions that impair child development and behavior generally improves functioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmental factors &ndash; Multiple environmental factors affect the natural history and outcome of ID. These include the availability and provision of appropriate supports, such as early intervention and education services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Appropriate supports lessen the impact of disability, improve the functioning of individuals with ID, and address child-specific needs, including those in practical, conceptual, or social adaptive domains. Early application of appropriate support is preferable because it can substantially improve the functioning of a child with ID. However, when ID is diagnosed later in childhood, sustained appropriate interventions can still improve outcomes. Given appropriate supports, a child with ID usually is able to acquire new skills and make progress. For many children, developmental progress is manifested by stable, enduring gains in function, but for others, the improvements are contingent upon sustaining support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some children make sufficient progress in functioning that they no longer meet criteria for the diagnosis of ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A child's course may also be affected by social factors such as caregiver support, expectations, attitudes, socioeconomic characteristics, social opportunities, and motivation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A youth's transition may be affected by environmental factors as well, such as the family system, provision of post-school services, and access to transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The severity<em> </em>of ID is now defined by the level of support needed to address impaired adaptive functioning, rather than by intelligence quotient scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-5) categorizes the levels of severity in ID from mild to moderate, severe, and profound. At least one impaired adaptive domain (practical, conceptual, or social adaptive functioning) needs ongoing support for a child to function adequately in one or more settings (such as home, school, or vocation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95384 \">table 2</a>). The American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) classifies the supports needed as intermittent, limited, extensive, and pervasive. Functional improvements may progress in the direction of attaining a less severe level of needed support, or less intense level of needed support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs#H17922307\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;, section on 'Classification of severity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild ID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with mild ID have slower developmental velocity than normally-developing children. They generally gain speech and language, reading, communication, social and vocational skills at a rate of approximately one-half to two-thirds of those who have no ID, but at approximately twice the pace of those with severe ID.</p><p>Children with mild ID need sustained academic supports to be able to learn and acquire age-typical skills, such as reading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With appropriate supportive services, children with mild ID usually accomplish reading at a third to sixth grade level by late adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Because children with mild ID have reasonable potential to learn to read, appropriate academic supports should be considered for them. However, outcomes may vary, and some adults are functionally illiterate.</p><p>Social skills, communication, and social judgment of children with mild ID are impaired compared with children without ID, but significantly better than children with moderate, severe, or profound ID. Children with mild ID usually can relate to others, communicate in friendship, and display social play and extracurricular interests. However, their interests and skill levels may be similar to those of younger children. In addition, social and communication outcomes can vary markedly with coexisting conditions. As an example, children with autism spectrum disorder may have disproportionately impaired social and communication skills for their level of cognitive functioning.</p><p>The long-term outcome of mild ID is related to cognitive and adaptive functioning. Intellectually-linked adaptive functions of practical, conceptual, and social skills play a critical role in the capacity for independent living and vocational outcome. Most individuals with mild ID are able to accomplish independent daily living activities. Many can live independently with provided supports including decision-making for health, nutrition, finances, or raising a family. An adult with mild ID can marry and even become a parent, although raising children is challenging. Some adults with mild ID can attain simple regular occupations in a competitive workplace, given appropriate supports. However, many adults with mild ID need sheltered employment and assisted living or a group home. Many other conditions impact the ability of an individual with mild ID to live and work independently (eg, coexisting behavioral disorders, cerebral palsy, and vision and hearing impairment).</p><p>Individuals with mild ID attain better long-term social and occupational outcomes than those with more severe ID. In some cases, as many as 67 percent are reported to have a job, 54 percent own a home, 73 percent marry, and 62 percent have children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Approximately 85 percent of individuals with ID are estimated to have mild ID (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95384 \">table 2</a>).

Conceptual skills lag well behind those of peers; substantial help or support is needed for conceptual tasks. Academic skills in adults are typically at elementary level. Children with moderate ID learn to read essential words and signs such as &quot;stop,&quot; &quot;exit,&quot; or &quot;danger.&quot; With educational services, a child with moderate ID can learn to read at a first to third grade level.</p><p>Simple spoken language and social friendships are possible, but significantly limited by social and communication deficits. Social cues, social judgment, and social decisions need regular help and support.</p><p>Long-term outcomes of moderate ID vary markedly, dependent on the presence and extent of coexisting conditions and disorders that frequently complicate moderate ID. Most individuals with moderate ID are capable of learning daily living activities and can achieve independent self-care, with sufficient teaching and support. Most individuals are able to reside in a group home in a community setting with support. The majority of adults with moderate ID need sheltered, supported, noncompetitive, vocational positions with minimal communication and conceptual demands, although some are capable of performing unskilled work. Few with moderate ID will be able to marry or raise children.</p><p>Approximately 10 percent of individuals with ID are estimated to have moderate ID (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95384 \">table 2</a>).

Adults without prohibitive coexisting conditions may be able to participate in sheltered vocational settings and, if not behaviorally disruptive, reside in a group home. The majority of adults with severe ID need assistance with daily living and social skills. In general, severely affected individuals do not marry or raise children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Profound ID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with profound ID may express themselves nonverbally and understand a simple instruction, gesture, or emotional cue. However, outcomes are very variable, and can vary from total dependence to some simple expression and social responsiveness; some individuals learn simple self-care in dressing or feeding.</p><p>Individuals with profound ID are usually dependent in all aspects of daily living. Some benefit from training in self-help skills, making very slow gains. Individuals may use objects in a goal-directed fashion in self-care or recreation. Most need high school classes in life skills and comprehensive assistance. Individuals with profound ID do not learn to read. Concurrent sensory and physical limitations are common, and coexisting medical conditions may need additional equipment. Medical needs, coexisting conditions, and behavioral characteristics impact which setting individuals with profound ID are placed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The life expectancy of children with profound ID varies with the cause, complicating disorders, and the mobility of the individual. In one series of immobile, tube-fed children, 80 percent died by 10 years of age, and most of these died by four years of age, from respiratory causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Most mobile, yet nonambulatory, children survived to at least 20 years of age.</p><p>Only 1 to 2 percent of individuals with ID are estimated to have profound ID (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95384 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most causes of ID cannot be prevented. When possible, strategies should be implemented to reduce the risk of ID, to detect treatable conditions such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and hypothyroidism, to monitor for conditions that worsen function, to minimize the extent of potential disability, and to improve the functioning of affected individuals. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Specific interventions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary prevention</strong> &ndash; Primary prevention describes measures to prevent ID and avoid conditions that cause ID. Examples of interventions include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoidance of prenatal exposure to alcohol or other toxins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use of prenatal multivitamins, especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Appropriate prenatal care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Newborn screening programs for metabolic disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Routine childhood immunizations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use of car seats and restraints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prevention of motor vehicle accidents, violence, and other trauma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Genetic forms of ID could be addressed by the following measures:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Provision of clinical genetics services to facilitate accurate genetic diagnosis and counseling when a genetic disorder is suspected or diagnosed in a child with ID. This is especially important for those with a family history of ID. Genetic counseling may enable estimation of recurrence risks and facilitate informed decision-making about reproductive options in the future.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and prenatal diagnosis may be possible for some forms of genetic ID where an accurate laboratory diagnosis has been established in an affected member of the family.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Secondary prevention</strong> &ndash; Secondary prevention is directed at treating an underlying condition to minimize the risk of impairment in ID. Interventions include lead surveillance in a child at risk for lead exposure, dietary restriction in metabolic diseases such as PKU or galactosemia, and thyroid hormone replacement in a hypothyroid child. Treatment of associated conditions such as vision and hearing impairment, seizures, and coexisting medical disorders, also may improve outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tertiary prevention</strong> &ndash; Tertiary prevention is aimed at maximizing function and quality of life by attempting to reduce functional disability. This approach includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early identification of individuals with ID and individuals at risk of meeting criteria for ID in the future.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Access to and provision of appropriate comprehensive supports, services, or resources.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of comorbid, associated, or coexisting conditions:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Identification and treatment of other concurrent neurodevelopmental disorders (eg, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit disorder).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Prevention, identification and treatment of neglect and abuse, depression, substance abuse, sleep disorder, and obesity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Prevention of accidents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Establishing an accurate diagnosis can be helpful in identifying body systems that need evaluation or surveillance and that have effects on morbidity and mortality (eg, congenital heart disease, renal function).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Genetic disorders are the most common cause of severe ID. All children with unexplained severe or profound ID should be offered genetic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25336217\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall goals of management of intellectual disability (ID) are to lessen the effects of disability and improve functioning, to prevent or minimize further deterioration relative to peers, and promote optimal functioning within the child's home and community settings. Interventions should be individualized, begin early, and be sustained. The approach should be collaborative and multidisciplinary. Depending on the individual's needs, intervention may include speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy and rehabilitation, family counseling and support, behavioral intervention, and educational assistance. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior interventions are usually needed to improve social and behavioral functioning in children with ID. These should be individualized and applied consistently. Desirable behaviors should be positively reinforced, and restraining or punitive aversive approaches should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Behavior intervention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interventions for other neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders associated with ID include family counseling, education, condition-specific behavioral interventions, and psychopharmacologic therapy. The use of medications should be part of a clear comprehensive psychosocial treatment plan that includes appropriate behavioral intervention, considers risks and benefits, identifies baseline behavioral functioning, target behaviors and treatment goals, and provides evidence-based treatment with baseline and serial monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Other neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health problems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, federal legislation supports a range of services for children with ID. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides for early intervention and special education for children with disabilities from birth to 21 years of age. All children with disabilities are mandated to receive a comprehensive education in the least restrictive environment, using an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), with measurable goals that are tailored to the individual's needs and abilities. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Legislative mandates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transition planning discussion should begin at or by 12 years of age, with a written transition plan in the child's medical record by 14 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Transition planning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcome for ID is variable and depends on multiple factors such as the cause and severity of ID, the presence of genetic disorder, the presence and severity of other associated conditions or concurrent neurodevelopmental disorder, environmental and social factors, and access to appropriate individualized supports that lessen disability and improve functioning. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of ID is defined by the degree of impairment in adaptive functioning (that is intellectually linked) and the need for supports, rather than by intellectual function alone or intelligence quotient score. Typical skills and outcomes for each of these severity levels are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95384 \">table 2</a>). Most ID is mild in severity. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary prevention of ID is aimed at preventing the underlying cause of ID. Secondary prevention of ID is directed at treating an underlying condition to minimize the risk of impairment. Tertiary prevention refers to measures that maximize function and quality of life in an individual with ID.
