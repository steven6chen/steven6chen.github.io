Increased mortality is found in those with alcohol intake that exceeds moderate limits and in binge drinkers. Moderate alcohol intake is associated with mortality benefits in those with no cardiac risk factors, as well as in those with risk factors including hypertension, patients with diabetes mellitus, and established coronary heart disease (CHD). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with a decreased incidence of CHD. While heavy alcohol drinking can induce cardiomyopathy, light to moderate ingestion may decrease the risk of heart failure in men and may decrease mortality associated with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

The net risk-benefit balance associated with moderate alcohol consumption is likely to differ in various age groups and populations. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends against advising people who don't currently drink to initiate light alcohol use. We suggest that carefully selected non-drinking patients with a high risk for CVD be advised that light drinking (no more than one to two drinks per day in men, and one drink daily in women) may decrease their cardiovascular risk (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
