The initial approach should focus upon general supportive measures while the diagnostic evaluation is ongoing; supportive measures include the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically stable patients'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral intravenous access with or without intravenous fluids (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic support'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen supplementation (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory support'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric anticoagulation depending upon the clinical suspicion for PE, risk of bleeding, and expected timing of definitive diagnostic tests (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Empiric anticoagulation'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276577990\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemodynamically unstable</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small percentage of patients with PE present with hemodynamic instability or shock (approximately 8 percent; ie, &ldquo;massive&rdquo; PE). When patients with suspected PE present with hypotension, initial support should focus upon restoring perfusion with intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support, as well as oxygenation and, if necessary, stabilizing the airway with intubation and mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic support'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory support'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults#H86227300\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;, section on 'Nomenclature'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients who become hemodynamically stable following resuscitation and in whom the clinical suspicion for PE is high, we prefer immediate anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> and prompt imaging for definitive diagnosis (usually computed tomographic pulmonary angiography [CTPA]). For patients with a moderate or low suspicion for PE, the use of empiric anticoagulation depends upon the timing of diagnostic testing. Diagnostic testing in patients with suspected PE is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Empiric anticoagulation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism#H518402085\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;, section on 'Hemodynamically stable patients'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a high clinical suspicion for PE who are hemodynamically unstable (ie, systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg for &gt;15 minutes, hypotension requiring vasopressors, or clear evidence of shock), and in whom transfer to radiology for a CTPA is considered unsafe, a portable perfusion scan can be done at some centers. When portable perfusion scanning or CTPA is not available or is unsafe, we prefer bedside echocardiography (transthoracic or transesophageal) to obtain a presumptive diagnosis of PE (right ventricle <span class=\"nowrap\">enlargement/hypokinesis,</span> regional wall motion abnormalities that spare the right ventricular apex [McConnell&rsquo;s sign], or visualization of clot) prior to the empiric administration of systemic thrombolytic therapy (ie, reperfusion therapy). If bedside echocardiography is delayed or unavailable, the use of thrombolytic therapy as a life-saving measure should be individualized; if not used, the patient should receive empiric anticoagulation. The initiation of anticoagulation should not be delayed while considering other, more aggressive interventional therapies. We suggest a similar approach for select patients with known PE whose course becomes complicated by hypotension during anticoagulation in whom the suspicion for recurrent PE despite anticoagulation is high. (See <a href=\"#H286667407\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically unstable patients'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with suspected PE who remain hemodynamically unstable and the clinical suspicion is low or moderate, the approach to empiric anticoagulation should be the same as for patients who are hemodynamically stable; empiric thrombolysis is not justified in this population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The decision to administer thrombolysis is strongly influenced by additional clinical factors. For example, while a patient with proven PE-induced shock who is unconscious requiring very high doses of pressors is a candidate for immediate intravenous thrombolytic therapy, a patient who has low blood pressure for 20 minutes but who is awake, alert, and comfortable, with low oxygenation requirement might be considered for anticoagulation alone, or an interventional procedure. Thus, when feasible, it is prudent to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to facilitate management of hemodynamically unstable patients with PE; some centers have incorporated a &ldquo;pulmonary embolism response team&rdquo; (PERT) to facilitate the process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-follow-up-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The echocardiographic findings suggestive of PE and the diagnostic approach to hemodynamically unstable patients, as well as the indications for thrombolytic therapy and its alternative, embolectomy, are discussed separately.

Severe hypoxemia, hemodynamic collapse, or respiratory failure should prompt consideration of intubation and mechanical ventilation. Importantly, patients with coexistent right ventricle failure are prone to hypotension following intubation. Thus, in this population, it may be prudent to consult an expert in cardiovascular anesthesia and high plateau pressures should be avoided. The principles of intubation, mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (which has been used successfully in severely ill patients with refractory hypoxemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension), are discussed separately.

In general, we prefer small volumes of intravenous fluid (IVF), usually 500 to 1000 mL of normal saline, followed by vasopressor therapy should perfusion fail to respond to IVF. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravenous fluid</strong> &ndash; IVF is first-line therapy for patients with hypotension. However, in patients with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, limited data suggest that aggressive fluid resuscitation is not beneficial, and may be harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-follow-up-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. The rationale for limiting IVF administration comes from preclinical studies and one small observational study in humans, which reported that small volumes of IVF increase the cardiac index in patients with PE, while excessive amounts of IVF result in RV overstretch (ie, RV overload), RV ischemia, and worsening RV failure. The patient&rsquo;s volume status should be carefully assessed as this could influence the approach to fluid administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vasopressors</strong> &ndash; Intravenous vasopressors are administered when adequate perfusion is not restored with IVF.

In such patients, empiric anticoagulant therapy may be administered on a case-by-case basis according to the assessed risk-benefit ratio and the values and preferences of the patient. Additionally, use of these bleeding estimates should <strong>not</strong> preclude clinical judgment when making a decision to anticoagulate in this population. As an example, we might empirically anticoagulate a patient with moderate risk of bleeding if they have a high clinical suspicion for PE, severe respiratory compromise, or an expected delay for the insertion of a vena caval filter. </p><p/><p>Typically, menstruation, epistaxis, and the presence of minor hemoptysis are not contraindications to anticoagulation but should be monitored during anticoagulant therapy.

As an example, low molecular weight heparin may be chosen for patients with hemodynamically stable PE who do not have renal insufficiency in whom rapid onset of anticoagulation needs to be guaranteed (ie, therapeutic levels are achieved with four hours). In contrast, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> is preferred by most experts in patients who are hemodynamically unstable in anticipation of a potential need for thrombolysis or embolectomy.

Accurate estimates have been limited by data that are mostly derived from older studies, registries, and hospital discharge records collected from heterogeneous populations of patients. As an example, a patient with a single, asymptomatic, subsegmental pulmonary embolism (SSPE) likely has a different prognosis than a patient with massive PE and shock. However, in general, if left untreated, PE is associated with an overall mortality of up to 30 percent compared with 2 to 11 percent in those treated with anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-prognosis-and-follow-up-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults/abstract/1,4,38,78-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,38,78-84</a>].

Supplemental oxygen should be administered to target an oxygen saturation &ge;90 percent. Severe hypoxemia, hemodynamic collapse, or respiratory failure should prompt consideration of mechanical ventilation. When mechanical ventilation is necessary, we prefer that an expert in cardiovascular anesthesia be consulted, when feasible, to avoid catastrophic hypotension due to sedation and positive pressure ventilation. For those who require hemodynamic support, we suggest cautious infusions of intravenous fluid (IVF; 500 to 1000 mL of normal saline) rather than larger volumes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Vasopressor therapy should be initiated if perfusion fails to respond to IVF.

If bedside testing is delayed or unavailable, the use of thrombolytic therapy as a life-saving measure should be individualized; if not used, the patient should receive empiric anticoagulation. For patients who are hemodynamically unstable and the clinical suspicion is low or moderate, we suggest empiric anticoagulation similar to that suggested for patients who are hemodynamically stable; empiric thrombolysis is not justified in this population.
