The pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of IPEX will be discussed in this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The defining feature of IPEX is immune dysregulation, resulting in autoimmune disease and allergic inflammation.</p><p>IPEX is caused by mutations in the gene for the transcription factor FOXP3 (<em>FOXP3</em>). FOXP3 is a member of the forkhead box P (FOXP) family of transcription factors and is fundamental to the function of a subset of T lymphocytes known as regulatory T cells (Tregs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Tregs exhibit potent immune suppressive effects and thereby play a fundamental role in immune homeostasis, particularly with respect to tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition to modulating autoimmune and allergic inflammation, Tregs also appear to be involved in transplantation tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The phenotype of IPEX was first described in 1982, and the first genetic mutations in <em>FOXP3</em> were identified in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. IPEX was previously designated X-linked polyendocrinopathy, immune dysfunction, and diarrhea (XPID) and X-linked autoimmunity and allergic dysregulation (XLAAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/5,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8</a>]. Patients who present with a similar phenotype but without mutations in FOXP3 are described as &quot;IPEX-like.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of T regulatory cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The suppressive actions of Tregs govern autoimmunity and atopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/2,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,10</a>]. CD4+ Tregs comprise 5 to 10 percent of the CD4+ T cell population and include natural Tregs derived from the thymus and adaptive or induced Tregs from the peripheral lymphoid tissues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development#H1232172\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;, section on 'Regulatory T cells (Tregs)'</a>.)</p><p>Unique subsets of Tregs appear to utilize different functional mechanisms, including cell contact-mediated cytotoxicity, competitive sequestration of interleukin-2 (IL-2), and cytokine-mediated inhibition via interleukin-10 (IL-10) or transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. Investigations using a mouse model suggest that FOXP3+ Tregs may also modulate autoreactive B cell populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The expansion of Tregs appears to be a natural consequence of the human immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. However, in vitro, Tregs are anergic and proliferate poorly. Tregs require IL-2 to survive and exert their suppressive functions. However, they do not produce IL-2, and therefore they are dependent upon its production by other types of CD4+ T cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development#H1232172\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;, section on 'Regulatory T cells (Tregs)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal function of FOXP3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FOXP3 is a member of the FOXP family of transcription factors. The gene is located on chromosome Xp11.23. It encodes a 431 amino acid protein with multiple, well-described functional domains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66800\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66800 \">figure 1</a>). In addition to the forkhead DNA-binding domain that interacts with the IL-2 promoter and other target genes, FOXP3 also contains an N-terminal proline-rich domain, which regulates transcription. A zinc finger motif may be involved in protein-DNA interactions, while a leucine zipper domain mediates homo- and heterodimerization with Foxp3 and other FOXP transcription factors. Methylation of C-phosphate-G sites (CpG methylation) and other epigenetic changes appear to be important in FOXP3 isoform expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A general discussion of transcription factors is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'RNA transcription'</a>.)</p><p>There is overwhelming evidence that FOXP3 plays a fundamental role in the differentiation of CD4+ Tregs and that high levels of Foxp3 expression are directly linked to the suppressive capacity of these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, in vitro overexpression of human FOXP3 in conventional T cells is not sufficient to induce potent immune suppression, indicating that other factors (in addition to FOXP3 expression) are required to optimize suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mutations in FOXP3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IPEX is due to loss of function mutations in FOXP3. These mutations result in quantitative or functional deficiencies of Tregs and thereby cause autoimmune disease and allergic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/5-7,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,23-25</a>]. A large number of mutations have been described, many of which are familial, although sporadic cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Except for the zinc finger motif, disease-causing mutations have been described in each of the main coding regions, demonstrating that each functional domain is essential to the normal function of FOXP3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66800\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66800 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Equally important are mutations in noncoding regions, which can also cause IPEX. However, at present, there is no clear genotype-phenotype correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/8,25,28,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25,28,31-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mouse model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A naturally occurring mutation of the <em>Foxp3</em> gene in mice causes the fatal autoimmune and inflammatory disorder called scurfy. This X-linked recessive lymphoproliferative disease has many of the clinical and molecular features of IPEX in humans. Scurfy is characterized by multiorgan lymphocytic infiltration and cytokine dysregulation due to unregulated T cell activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In scurfy mice, a frameshift mutation omits the forkhead domain of the gene product and demonstrates that a fully functional protein is essential for immune homeostasis.

As the physical manifestations of scurfy are due to the lack of functional Tregs, the phenotype of these mice can be reversed by bone marrow reconstitution, adoptive transfer of an enriched CD25+ T cell population, or the introduction of a <em>Foxp3</em> transgene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IPEX is a rare, X-linked disorder that classically presents in infancy. Published reports of patients with IPEX are limited, and therefore, the prevalence and incidence are unknown. Moreover, retrospective analysis suggests many cases may have been underreported or misdiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/8,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,38,39</a>]. A retrospective study of the incidence of neonatal diabetes in Australia identified 1 case of IPEX in 10 cases of neonatal diabetes contained in the national registry data from 1989 to 2007, and thus, these data provide an estimate of the incidence of IPEX at 1 in 1,609,490 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

In this respect, patients with IPEX are similar to those with systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune diseases. The signs and symptoms that comprise a disease flare can vary among different patients and may vary from episode to episode for a given patient.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes and related disorders&quot;, section on 'Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ALPS</strong> &ndash; Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is caused by defects in Fas, Fas ligand, or caspases 8 or 10 that interfere with programmed cell death and result in the failure to delete autoreactive clones. As with IPEX, there is diffuse autoimmune disease. However, the dominant clinical features are chronic lymphadenopathy with splenomegaly, autoimmune anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Enteropathy is rare. In addition, T cell subsets are remarkable for increased double-negative (CD4-CD8-) gamma-delta cells.

Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS I), also denoted autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, candidiasis, ectodermal dysplasia (APECED), is caused by defects in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) transcription factor. Autoimmune disease results from the failure of AIRE to regulate the expression of tissue-specific antigens on thymic medullary epithelial cells. Thus, autoreactive T cells are not identified and deleted. As a result, type 1 diabetes mellitus and other endocrinopathies may be found in APS I. Unlike IPEX, APS I is characterized by CMC, as well as autoimmune disease of the parathyroid and adrenals. Antibodies to tryptophan hydrolase-1 (TPH-1) appear to be present in APS I (especially in patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction), but not in IPEX. Conversely, antibodies to autoimmune enteropathy-related 75 kDa antigen (AIE-75) are present in patients with IPEX but not APS I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ipex-immune-dysregulation-polyendocrinopathy-enteropathy-x-linked/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].

Immune suppression is generally required to achieve sufficient improvement in the diarrhea.</p><p>Once the stooling pattern has normalized, feeds should be reintroduced slowly.
