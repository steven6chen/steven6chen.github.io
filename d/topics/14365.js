Burns to these areas generally occur in conjunction with burns involving other anatomic sites, but may be isolated as in the cases of intentional scalding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Resuscitation and stabilization of the burned patient are the first priorities, followed by management of the burn wounds.</p><p>Burns to the perineum and genitalia can potentially impair or destroy function, esthetics, and the ability to maintain proper hygiene. The loss of normal tissue and scarring can result in limitation of movement, pain, disfigurement, and social embarrassment. Surveillance for preservation of genitourinary and sexual function is a component of the treatment plan.</p><p>The initial management of burns to the perineum and genitalia and reconstruction of the resultant complicated wounds are discussed here. Local treatment and acute management and an overview of reconstruction principles are reviewed elsewhere.

Isolated burns to the perineum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genitalia are rare, particularly in females, and are a marker for abuse in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/1,4,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6-8</a>]. Isolated burns in children warrant an evaluation for possible child abuse and a clear etiology of the burn should be established (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H1678231804\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Intentional burns'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-social-and-medicolegal-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Social and medicolegal issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The global epidemiology of burns is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-burn-injuries-globally\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of burn injuries globally&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12784924\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of perineal and genital burns include scald, flame, chemical, and electrical contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/2-4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,7</a>]. Accidental burns can sometimes be distinguished from intentional burns. Intentional scalds are symmetrical, have distinct upper borders, and may be associated with old fractures or unrelated injuries. In comparison, unintentional perineal burns have irregular borders and depth. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34613314\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of patients with superficial and deep burns to the perineum and genitalia is conservative, including cleansing, gentle gauze debridement of loose burned tissue if present, and coverage with topical antimicrobial agents and dressings. The wound healing rate with conservative measures ranges from approximately 80 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/1,4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with substantial burns involving the perineum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genitalia alone, or including the inguinal or lower truncal areas, the management is more complex. The thighs should be maintained at 15&deg; abduction to facilitate healing and dressing changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition to local topical agents and dressings, the initial management of the extensively burned patient also includes protecting the urethral meatus from obliteration due to swelling and protecting the burned skin from urinary and fecal contamination. </p><p>Necrotizing infections can occur in contaminated perineal burn wounds. The treatment of necrotizing cellulitis and fasciitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12785233\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A urethral catheter should be placed in the acute setting to monitor urine output, control urinary continence, and avoid the risk of inability to catheterize the urethra as edema in the perineum develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A delay in catheterizing the urethra can result in an inability to visualize the structure as edema develops in the preputial skin in males and labial tissue in females, obstructing the meatus. Prophylactic catheterization helps prevent stricture formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-urinary-bladder-catheters-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12785244\"><span class=\"h2\">Bowel management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fecal contamination of a burn can result in sepsis, delayed wound healing, graft loss, and contracture of scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Fecal diversion can be managed with the use of either a bowel management system (rectal tube) or a diverting colostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical ostomy for fecal diversion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For most patients, a rectal tube is adequate for fecal diversion. These tubes will only function properly if loose stool material is passed through them, otherwise they become obstructed and may cause fecal impaction. Stool softeners and enemas can be used to maintain loose stools. Two specifically designed intrarectal catheters (ie, Zassi Bowel Management System and the Flexi-Seal Fecal Management System) are safe and effective in managing fecal diversion without skin graft loss or a colostomy, but they may also cause anal ulceration and sphincter atony [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/9,10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,13</a>].</p><p>Temporary diverting colostomy has been advocated for deep perineal burns and in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; however, with modern bowel management systems, the authors have found this to be unnecessary in these situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although a diverting colostomy facilitates perineal burn wound management, we have encountered complications in the acute period that included peri-stomal bowel herniation, difficulties sealing the stoma in the presence of surrounding burned tissue with subsequent bowel content leakage, maceration of the peri-stomal skin, and devitalized bowel in the stoma area. The stoma can be reversed after the burns have healed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12785251\"><span class=\"h2\">Debridement and demarcation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sharp debridement is <strong>not</strong> performed until the burns have been allowed to demarcate. Demarcation of the burn wound, which is the conversion of an apparently superficial wound depth to a deeper burn depth, typically occurs by the third post-burn day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-burn-injury#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of burn injury&quot;, section on 'Classification by depth'</a>.)</p><p>Acute coverage of deep burns, and superficial burns that do not heal with conservative management, includes sharp debridement of the burn eschar after demarcation and coverage of the site with skin grafts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-procedures-used-in-the-management-of-burn-injuries#H22158166\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical procedures used in the management of burn injuries&quot;, section on 'Skin grafting'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34613401\"><span class=\"h1\">RECONSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reconstruction of the burn wound serves to restore function and improve esthetics by releasing or excising scar contractures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> remodeling tissues.

In some instances, reconstructive procedures are performed sooner, such as stricture formation involving the urethra or perineal scar obstructing the anus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-procedures-used-in-the-management-of-burn-injuries#H1883166\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical procedures used in the management of burn injuries&quot;, section on 'Burn scar revision and timing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5948287\"><span class=\"h2\">Perineum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cicatricial contractures are the most common complication of perineal burns, occurring in approximately one-third of patients with partial or full thickness perineal and genital burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17</a>]. The perineal contracture can present as a scar band that extends between the medial thighs and crosses the area between the genitalia and the anus, or as a band that extends between the proximal medial thigh to the perineum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. These scars can result in perineal obliteration, hip adduction contractures, and limitation of the hip range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p>The reconstructive procedure performed depends upon the extensiveness of the scar and availability of unburned tissue for coverage of the defect created by contracture release or scar excision. There is no one optimal approach and the surgeon must make a case by case decision for each patient. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a limited burn contracture, an excision of the contracture with primary closure of the defect can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with moderate contractures, or those for whom a primary wound closure is not possible, the defects can be managed using local trapezoid flaps created from tissues on the inner thighs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These flaps are variations of the transposition z-plasty technique that uses adipocutaneous flaps from neighboring skin to interrupt or realign scars without using a skin graft. When performing this technique using burned skin, caution is advised when mobilizing flaps to avoid flap loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=z-plasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Z-plasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For wounds not amenable to primary closure or closure with local trapezoid flaps, the defects created by the contracture excision can be covered with full thickness skin grafts, or partial thickness skin grafts with a dermal regeneration template [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the types of skin grafts is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-procedures-used-in-the-management-of-burn-injuries#H843899998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical procedures used in the management of burn injuries&quot;, section on 'Burn wound coverage'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For extensive defects that result from excision of large scars, fasciocutaneous flaps can be used. The groin flap, a fasciocutaneous flap that includes the fascia from the sartorius muscle, is excellent tissue for simultaneous perineal, inguinal, and anal reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The anterolateral thigh flap, which is located between the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis, has emerged as one of the most versatile reconstructive options for multiple sites. Based on a perforator flap harvest concept, the flap encompasses the advantages of versatility, pliability, and potential for composite tissue replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34613422\"><span class=\"h2\">Genitalia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of skin grafts with or without dermal scaffolding material is the most frequent procedure performed for secondary reconstruction of burned genitalia. Other options include fasciocutaneous flaps and variations of the z-plasty technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. The local flap options described for secondary contractures in the inguinal region also apply to reconstruction of genitalia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-procedures-used-in-the-management-of-burn-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical procedures used in the management of burn injuries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins#H17954524\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of burn reconstruction: Extremities and regional nodal basins&quot;, section on 'Inguinal region'</a>.)</p><p>Ingenious methods of splinting to secure the skin graft or flap in place have been created. We use Allevyn foam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] for its ease of application and have also used topical negative pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=negative-pressure-wound-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Negative pressure wound therapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34613330\"><span class=\"h3\">Male</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burns to the male genitalia may cause tissue retraction and scarring, which can result in shaft deformity, inability to achieve normal erections, and meatal obstruction. The goal of reconstruction of the penis and scrotum is to maintain urinary and sexual function and preserve anatomical and esthetic integrity. </p><p>The medical and functional consequences of a burn involving the male external genitalia depend upon the depth and extent of the burn injury. For deep <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unhealed burns, sharp debridement of devitalized burned tissue is typically performed. Prior to initiating sharp debridement, the urethra should be protected by inserting an indwelling urinary catheter. The penis should be held under gentle traction and all burned tissue sharply d&eacute;brided. We use a Goulian knife with an <span class=\"nowrap\">8/1000</span> inch guard; a hydrosurgical technique with the VersaJet system is an acceptable alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Following sharp debridement of devitalized tissue, reconstruction of the male genitalia can proceed depending on the site involved, extensiveness of the burn, and the availability of unburned skin. The following reconstructive options available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The scrotum can usually be reconstructed using full thickness skin grafts alone or split thickness skin grafts with a dermal template. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the testicles are exposed as a result of the burn or debridement, they can be transferred to pockets fashioned in the inner thigh. While testicular function is preserved, the cosmetic appearance is relatively poor. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconstruction of the penis involves release of the burn contracture to prevent foreshortening of the shaft. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If Buck&rsquo;s fascia is spared (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76391 \">figure 1</a>), multiple Z-plasties can be performed to release the contracture. If the contracture is excised, the defect created is covered with a full thickness skin graft. Split thickness skin graft alone may result in debilitating, inelastic, and painful hypertrophic scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. If using split thickness grafts, a dermal template should be used to avoid these complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If Buck&rsquo;s fascia is involved, a surgical release of the deformity is performed, and the defect can be covered with a pedicled flap, such as the anterolateral thigh flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] or the medial circumflex femoral artery perforator flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with loss of the deeper layers of the penis, such as the corpora cavernosa, or loss of the glans and meatus, require a complex and multidisciplinary approach with urologic expertise. Prosthetics and complex free microvascular flaps to reconstruct a neo-phallus may be necessary, such as a thoracodorsal artery perforator flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] or a forearm fasciocutaneous flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and full thickness skin grafts to create a urethral tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Scarring of the prepuce is treated by circumcision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The microvascular free tissue transfer of a composite radial forearm fasciocutaneous flap phalloplasty with or without a prosthesis or bone graft is an option to closure and urinary drainage through a large meatotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/22,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,32</a>].

If a total loss occurs in a child, reconstruction is typically performed at age 6 to 8 years, even though revisions will be necessary as the child reaches puberty, because of the psychologic impact that can affect both the child and the parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34613322\"><span class=\"h3\">Female</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to reconstruction of female genitalia after a burn is based upon case reports and small series of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/8,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,33</a>].

A review of 5280 pediatric burn reconstructive procedures identified only 18 children (less than one percent) undergoing a release of a perineal contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-perineum-and-genitalia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The initial management of 14 of the 18 patients was conservative with minimal wound debridement, topical antimicrobials, and dressing changes. The other four patients were treated with excision and skin grafts. </p><p>The mean time from burn to contracture development was 3.8 years (range 3 months to 11 years). The contractures were treated with a local flap (10 patients), incisional release and split-thickness skin grafting (5 patients), primary closure and release (1 patient), and a combination of these procedures (2 patients). A secondary contracture developed in 4 patients between approximately 3 and 5 years after the initial perineal reconstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H399645927\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burns to the perineum and genitalia are uncommon, particularly as isolated events. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary goal of managing burns of the perineum is preservation of urinary and fecal continence. The initial management of burns to the perineum and genitalia include cleansing, gentle gauze debridement of loose burned tissue, topical antimicrobial agents, and dressing changes. Urinary catheters, rectal tubes, and or a colostomy (temporary or permanent) can be used to protect the burned perineum from contamination. (See <a href=\"#H34613314\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burns should demarcate before attempting sharp debridement. (See <a href=\"#H34613314\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconstruction of the perineum includes release of scar and coverage with skin grafts alone or with dermal regeneration templates, z-plasty techniques with local trapezoid flaps, or fasciocutaneous flaps. (See <a href=\"#H5948287\" class=\"local\">'Perineum'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reconstructive approach is based upon the extensiveness of the scar and the availability of unburned tissue for reconstruction. Reconstruction of the male genitalia is performed to restore function and esthetics. The scrotum can be reconstructed with skin grafts, the penis with contracture release and coverage with skin grafts or pedicled flaps, depending on the extensiveness of damage (see <a href=\"#H34613330\" class=\"local\">'Male'</a> above). For complete loss of a penis in children, reconstruction is delayed until puberty. Free tissue transfer with or with without the use of a tubed prosthesis may be required in total loss of the penis to warrant sexual function. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconstruction of the female genitalia includes release of contractures with z-plasty techniques, skin grafts, and regional flaps. Reconstruction of the vaginal vault can be performed with a flap, such as the rectus abdominus or gracilis flap. (See <a href=\"#H34613322\" class=\"local\">'Female'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Huang, T.
