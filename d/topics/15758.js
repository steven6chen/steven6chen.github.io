The lesions can be congenital or acquired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80526\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80526 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The manifestations and diagnosis of sixth nerve palsy, also known as lateral rectus palsy and abducens nerve palsy, are reviewed here. Palsies of the third and fourth cranial nerves are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each sixth nerve nucleus in the dorsal pons contains all of the neurons responsible for ipsilateral horizontal gaze. They include the motor neurons for the ipsilateral lateral rectus muscle and the interneurons to the contralateral third nerve medial rectus muscle subnucleus in the midbrain. The interneurons travel through the medial longitudinal fasciculus to the contralateral third nerve subnucleus.</p><p>The sixth nerve fascicle leaves the nucleus and travels within the substance of the pontine tegmentum, adjacent to the medial lemniscus and adjacent to the corticospinal tract. It leaves the brainstem at the pontomedullary junction, enters the subarachnoid space (prepontine cistern), courses nearly vertically along the clivus, and travels over the petrous apex of the temporal bone where it is tethered at the petroclinoid ligament in Dorello canal. It enters the substance of the cavernous sinus lateral to the internal carotid artery and medial to the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. The sixth nerve enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure to innervate the lateral rectus muscle, which abducts the eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72952 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with sixth nerve palsies typically complain of binocular (ie, requires both eyes to be open) horizontal diplopia that worsens with gaze toward the paretic lateral rectus muscle. However, children may not complain of diplopia.</p><p>Early in the course, strabismus may be present only in the gaze toward the paralyzed side, but with time, the strabismus (ie, esotropia) may be present when gazing straight ahead (in primary position). The degree of esotropia and abduction deficit are markers of severity of the paresis or palsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-horizontal-strabismus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of horizontal strabismus in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ocular examination typically reveals a primary position esotropia (eye turned in), worse in gaze toward the paretic muscle (lateral incomitance), and an ipsilateral abduction deficit. The face often is turned toward the paralyzed side to avoid the gaze toward the symptomatic lateral rectus muscle. Other manifestations depend upon the location of the lesion along the course of the nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55159\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55159 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nuclear lesions result in an ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy rather than an isolated abduction deficit alone because of involvement of the interneurons of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. These interneurons control contralateral medial rectus function (adduction) during attempted ipsilateral horizontal gaze. Ipsilateral facial nerve palsy may occur because of the close proximity of the facial and abducens nerves in the pons. Nuclear and fascicular lesions usually are associated with other brainstem signs (eg, hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, central Horner syndrome).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions of the subarachnoid space can result in unilateral or bilateral sixth nerve palsies. A sixth nerve palsy can occur in these patients as a nonlocalizing sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), due to traction of the sixth nerve. The sixth nerve is particularly susceptible to this phenomenon because of its long course within the subarachnoid space. Other neurologic symptoms (eg, headache, nausea, vomiting) and signs (eg, dorsal midbrain syndrome, papilledema) of increased ICP also may be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions of the petrous apex often cause facial pain and damage to the fifth, seventh, and eighth cranial nerves in addition to the sixth nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cavernous sinus lesions often damage the adjacent third, fourth, and fifth (subdivisions one and two) cranial nerves or may cause an ipsilateral Horner syndrome.

The lesions can be congenital or acquired.</p><p>Tumors can compress the sixth nerve anywhere along its path. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) produces a sixth nerve palsy by causing pressure or traction of the nerve at the skull base. Inflammatory and infectious (eg, meningitis) disorders tend to affect the sixth nerve in the subarachnoid space. Traumatic sixth nerve palsies often are associated with fractures of the base of the skull. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skull fractures in children: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most common causes of sixth nerve palsy in children are tumors, trauma, increased ICP, and congenital. One study reviewed the causes of sixth nerve palsies in 75 children with an average age of eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Neoplasms or their neurosurgical removal was the most common cause, accounting for 34 cases (45 percent). The most common tumors were posterior fossa medulloblastoma and brainstem glioma. Other causes included elevated ICP (pseudotumor cerebri) (15 percent), trauma (12 percent), congenital (11 percent), inflammatory (7 percent), miscellaneous (5 percent), and idiopathic (5 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histopathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-medulloblastoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histopathology and molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-brainstem-glioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal brainstem glioma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of sixth nerve palsy includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restrictive orbitopathies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spasm of the near reflex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myasthenia gravis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supranuclear disorders of gaze</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Childhood esotropia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duane syndrome 1</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid eye disease</p><p/><p>Restrictive abduction defects can be produced by orbital floor fracture, orbital tumors or orbital pseudotumor, and thyroid ophthalmopathy. Patients with restrictive orbital disease usually demonstrate proptosis, chemosis (conjunctival edema), conjunctival injection, and positive forced ductions (restrictive findings on passive movement of the globe with ophthalmic forceps). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Spasm of the near reflex (eg, convergence spasm) is associated with a variable esotropia (turning in of the eyes) and abduction deficit with miosis (constriction) of the pupil. The finding of intense miosis on attempted lateral gaze is an important clue to making the correct diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Spasm of the near reflex usually is a nonorganic finding but rarely may be caused by an organic intracranial process.</p><p>Myasthenia gravis should be considered in any painless, pupil-sparing ophthalmoplegia, including sixth nerve palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Additional signs and symptoms of myasthenia gravis, such as ptosis, variability, and fatigue, usually are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Paralysis of ocular movements also occurs with supranuclear paralyses. In contrast to patients with sixth nerve palsy, patients who have supranuclear disorders of gaze do not have diplopia because the eyes remain parallel. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supranuclear disorders of gaze in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of infants and children with sixth nerve palsy depends upon whether the palsy is isolated or accompanied by other neurologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/14,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,17</a>].

Children who develop a sixth nerve palsy in the setting of minor head trauma also should undergo neuroimaging because sixth nerve palsy may be the presenting manifestation of a skull-based neoplasm.

The condition may recur, but the diagnosis of recurrent postviral sixth nerve palsy should be considered a diagnosis of exclusion. Other etiologies, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic causes, must be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The imaging (eg, computed tomography) should be performed emergently when focal signs or papilledema are present. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium is the preferred modality because of superior capability of imaging of the posterior fossa, but it may not be available on an emergent basis.

Children with infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic lesions should receive appropriate therapy for the underlying condition. Such treatment may alleviate diplopia. Spontaneous recovery is common in patients with unilateral, isolated, nontraumatic sixth nerve palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Symptomatic patients with isolated congenital or acquired palsies should be considered for treatment. The goal is to maximize visual function, including alignment.</p><p>Traumatic sixth nerve palsy may resolve spontaneously. Spontaneous recovery occurs more commonly in unilateral than in bilateral cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/18,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21,22</a>]. Thus, patients with traumatic sixth nerve palsy usually are observed for several months before treatment is considered. Inability to abduct past midline (complete palsy) and bilateral involvement at the time of presentation is associated with failure to recover by six months after injury, with or without therapy (prism, patch, or botulinum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Palsies that do not resolve tend to become comitant deviations. Comitant deviations are those in which the distance between the double images is equal in the various gaze directions and symptoms are affected only slightly by the direction of gaze.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment modalities may include alternate patching, prism therapy, strabismus surgery, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> botulinum toxin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternate patching &ndash; Alternate patching of each eye alleviates binocular diplopia in children with sixth nerve palsy. Alternate patching is useful in children who are being observed or who defer treatment with prisms or surgery. Patching in children younger than nine years of age should be employed with caution and with the assistance of an ophthalmology consultant, because complete full-time occlusion of a single eye can lead to the development of iatrogenic (occlusion) amblyopia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amblyopia in children: Classification, screening, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prism therapy &ndash; Prism therapy may be employed for small, comitant, long-standing deviations. A temporary press-on (Fresnel) prism of sufficient power to align the eyes is placed on the spectacle lens of the affected child. Permanent prisms can be ground into the spectacle lens if the patient is happy with the result and the deviation fails to improve spontaneously.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strabismus surgery &ndash; Strabismus surgery may be helpful in patients who fail prism therapy. In one study of 64 children 7 years of age or younger with sixth nerve palsy of varying etiologies, approximately one-quarter underwent strabismus surgery; residual strabismus was present in 66 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Botulinum toxin &ndash; Botulinum toxin, a neurotoxin that causes temporary muscle paralysis, has been used in patients with acute unilateral sixth nerve palsy. It is injected into the ipsilateral medial rectus muscle (the antagonist of the lateral rectus) to prevent secondary contracture and to reduce the nasal deviation. In a randomized trial in adults with acute unilateral sixth nerve palsy of various etiologies, recovery rates were similar between the treatment and control groups <span class=\"nowrap\">(19/22</span> [86 percent] versus <span class=\"nowrap\">20/25</span> [80 percent], respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Randomized controlled trials have not been performed in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Botulinum toxin has been useful in the management of chronic sixth nerve palsy in some patients in uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sixth-cranial-nerve-abducens-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].
