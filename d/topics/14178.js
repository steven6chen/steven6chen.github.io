Such effects occur more commonly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> overdose, especially after intravenous administration. Reluctance to administer epinephrine due to fear of adverse cardiac effects should be countered by the awareness that myocardial ischemia and dysrhythmias can also occur in children and adults with anaphylaxis who have not received epinephrine treatment and in whom no cardiovascular disease can be found after the episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Unintentional injections and other injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of unintentional injections of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> from autoinjectors is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], with more than 15,000 such events being reported voluntarily to the American Association of Poison Control Centers from 1994 to 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In another large retrospective series of 365 unintentional injections specifically to the hand, all patients had complete resolution of symptoms, without the need for admission or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The product is available in just one dose, with product labeling indicating use for patients &ge;30 kg (66 lbs).

The provision of a syringe prefilled with epinephrine, stored away from light and kept for a brief period such as three months, has also been considered as a low-cost alternative but suffers from concerns about sterility and stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The higher dose is appropriate for adults and children weighing more than 25 kg (55 lbs). Large or obese individuals should have access to multiple doses. Dosing in small children is discussed below.

Compared with subcutaneous injection, intramuscular injection of epinephrine results in higher and more rapid plasma concentrations and is therefore the recommended route of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, in a series of 28 patients, needle length was not sufficient to reach the underlying muscle of the anterolateral thigh in 68 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The issue was more common in women, even those with normal body mass index (BMI). These findings may raise concerns about suboptimal delivery, although human treatment studies have not been undertaken to quantify the potential differences in serum dose and kinetics. In addition, a retrospective chart review of emergency department patients with anaphylaxis, mostly children, found that the need for a second dose did not correlate with overweight status, suggesting repeat dosing is not a result of obesity or suboptimal medication delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Having a second autoinjector available addresses the concern that treatment may be inadequate for this or other reasons, pending further study of the implications of needle length and patient weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many countries, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjectors are available in only two fixed doses: 0.15 mg and 0.3 mg. The availability of just two doses in autoinjectable form presents difficulties in delivering an appropriate dose to many children. The recommended dose of epinephrine for children is 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> up to 0.3 mg. Therefore, the premeasured autoinjectors technically contain the recommended dose only for a 15 kg (33 lbs) or a 30 kg (66 lbs) individual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Small children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prescribing information for autoinjectors containing 0.15 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> indicates that the dose is intended for patients weighing 15 to 30 kg (33 to 66 lbs). Using these manufacturers' guidelines, children weighing 25 kg would receive the 0.15 mg dose, although the optimal dose for a child of that weight is higher (0.25 mg). Furthermore, little information is provided about dosing in a child weighing less than 15 kg, other than the caveat that dosing decisions are the responsibility of the prescribing clinician.</p><p>Examples of dosing issues raised by fixed-dose autoinjectors in small children include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a 7.5 kg child, the 0.15 mg autoinjector delivers a 2-fold overdose, and for a 10 kg child, the 0.15 mg autoinjector delivers a 1.5-fold overdose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a 20 kg child, the 0.15 mg autoinjector delivers only 75 percent of the ideal dose, and the 0.3 mg autoinjector delivers a 1.5-fold overdose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a 25 kg child, the 0.15 mg autoinjector delivers only 60 percent of the ideal dose, and the 0.3 mg autoinjector delivers a 1.2-fold overdose.</p><p/><p>Despite the lack of precision in dosing with autoinjectors, the alternative (ie, drawing up <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> in a syringe to obtain the correct weight-based dose) is associated with delayed administration, inaccurate dosing, and potential loss of the dose. A study of the ability of parents without medical training to utilize an ampule and syringe after receiving verbal and written instructions in a nonurgent setting found this method to be error-prone and slow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>One study indicated that children generally tolerate higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> without serious adverse events. In a randomized trial, children (aged four to eight years and weighing 15 to 30 kg) who were at risk for anaphylaxis received either 0.15 mg or 0.3 mg of epinephrine intramuscularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The higher dose resulted in significantly higher systolic blood pressures compared with the lower dose but was also associated with transient nausea, palpitations, and headache.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4155465548\"><span class=\"h4\">Suggested approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To provide additional guidance to the clinician, a clinical report from the American Academy of Pediatrics reviewed the risks and benefits of selecting the 0.15 mg or the 0.3 mg fixed doses for children of different weights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The report references European guidelines, suggesting the 0.15 mg autoinjector may be used for infants weighing as little as 7.5 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The following summarizes our suggested approach based on these guidelines, but specific decisions should be individualized according to patient characteristics and family preferences (eg, severity of allergy, comorbid conditions, family proficiency with using a syringe and ampule):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dosing for infants under 7.5 kg would require an ampule and syringe or a prefilled syringe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <span class=\"nowrap\">infants/children</span> weighing 7.5 kg to 10 kg, the clinician has two prescribing options:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prescribe the 0.15 mg autoinjector.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For caregivers who are able to demonstrate proficiency, prescribe an ampule (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, provide a <span class=\"nowrap\">syringe/needle,</span> and give instructions on how to draw up and administer the exact dose indicated (0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> up to 0.3 mg). For the proficient user, this approach is preferable to the clinician or pharmacist drawing up epinephrine in advance and supplying it to the patient in this form because epinephrine degrades rapidly when stored in an unsealed syringe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <span class=\"nowrap\">infants/children</span> 10 kg to 15 kg, prescribing a 0.15 mg autoinjector will usually be preferred over the alternatives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children weighing 15 kg (33 lbs) to 25 kg (55 lbs) can receive the 0.15 mg dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children weighing over 25 kg (55 lbs) can receive the 0.3 mg dose autoinjector.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dosing might be individualized for children with severe past reactions, to select the higher of the two fixed doses at lower weights.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">KEY TEACHING POINTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several important teaching points that should be emphasized when instructing patients in optimal use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjectors. These should be reviewed with patients at regular intervals. Patient information that reiterates these teaching points is also available.

One exposure to an allergen may result in mild symptoms, while the next causes a life-threatening reaction or visa-versa, for reasons that are not fully understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Epinephrine is the best treatment available</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be assured that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is the most effective treatment available for anaphylaxis and that having an autoinjector will enable <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> to start treatment without delay. Fatal anaphylaxis is associated with lack of availability of epinephrine or failure to inject epinephrine promptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-epinephrine-for-anaphylaxis-self-treatment/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. This fact may be expressed to the patient as the following: &quot;In most cases of anaphylaxis that prove fatal, the person who died either did not have epinephrine available, or had it available but did not use it. Thus, by having an epinephrine autoinjector and knowing how to use it, the patient already has a significant advantage.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Carry the autoinjector at all times</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> autoinjectors must be carried at all times in order to be available when the drug is actually needed. Patients may make the mistake of having their autoinjectors on hand only in the setting where they spend most time (ie, home, school, or work). However, they may be at particular risk for anaphylaxis when out of their normal routines (eg, during exercise, while dining out, attending celebrations and banquets, or traveling).
