The life cycle of the organism was unraveled by Koch, who recognized the importance of dormant anthrax spores in the perpetuation of the organism in soil. These studies eventually helped to underpin Koch's postulates, a milestone in establishing specific pathogens as the causative agents of human and animal diseases. Pasteur created the first successful antibacterial vaccine by successfully attenuating strains of <em>B. anthracis</em> and then proving that these strains could protect sheep from infection with fully virulent strains.</p><p>The microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of anthrax will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of anthrax are discussed separately.

It is nonmotile and grows rapidly at 37&ordm;C on blood agar plates under aerobic conditions. Individual colonies are nonhemolytic and sticky. A gamma bacteriophage can be used to confirm the identity of the organism, and polymerase chain reaction techniques can be used to identify as few as three spores of <em>B. anthracis</em> in a single specimen.</p><p>There is less genomic variation in <em>B. anthracis</em> than in any other known bacterial species that causes disease in humans. As a result, strain differentiation relies on demonstrating variations in copy number of tandem repeating DNA segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] or finding single-nucleotide polymorphisms by whole-genome sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>B. anthracis</em> is not phylogenetically distinct from <em>Bacillus cereus</em> and is presently considered a clade within the species <em>B. cereus </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, because of its medical significance, <em>B. anthracis</em> retains its original species name.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2581166839\"><span class=\"h2\">Portals of entry and dissemination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>B. anthracis</em> can invade the body by four routes: gastrointestinal, transcutaneous, pulmonary, and direct parenteral injection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal tract</strong> &ndash; Although disseminated anthrax frequently affects the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], the term &quot;gastrointestinal anthrax&quot; is used to refer to cases in which the organism gains access through ingestion. Most anthrax in nature occurs in herbivores and is acquired via the gastrointestinal route. Spores contaminating grasses are ingested. The organism then invades gut-associated lymphoid tissue, especially at Peyer's patches. An in vitro study using a cell line derived from human M cells suggests that, as in several other infections, the M cell plays a role in bacterial cell uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In humans, gastrointestinal anthrax follows ingestion of contaminated and undercooked meat, although one case was described in a patient who had played a contaminated hand drum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Following ingestion, anthrax bacilli are transported to mesenteric lymph nodes. Subsequently, hemorrhagic mesenteric adenitis, ascites, and septicemia may occur. This investigation suggests that the patient was exposed to <em>B. anthracis</em> spores aerosolized at the drumming event, which resulted in gastrointestinal anthrax rather than inhalation anthrax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H365640507\" class=\"local\">'Animal hides'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin</strong> &ndash; Invasion through the skin may occur via two mechanisms. Although skin abrasions were thought to be necessary for cutaneous infection, the organism also appears to be able to invade hair follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Once <em>B.</em> <em>anthracis</em> spores introduced under the skin become vegetative organisms and begin to multiply, subsequent production of an antiphagocytic capsule facilitates local spread, and exotoxin production produces extensive brawny edema and tissue necrosis, the hallmarks of cutaneous anthrax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inhalation</strong> &ndash; The classic understanding of inhalation anthrax is that spores must reach the terminal bronchioles and alveoli, where they spread to the mediastinal lymph nodes. There, they germinate and induce a hemorrhagic mediastinitis before disseminating. Airborne anthrax spores &gt;5 microns in size pose no threat to the lungs, since they are either physically trapped in the nasopharynx or cleared by the mucociliary escalator system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, spores between 1 and 5 microns in size are deposited in alveolar ducts or alveoli. These spores are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and transported to mediastinal lymph nodes, where they multiply and cause hemorrhagic mediastinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,10</a>]. Bacteremia and meningitis are frequent complications of mediastinal infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Direct injection</strong> &ndash; Direct injection into the host can occur when contaminated heroin is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This has occurred by the transcutaneous route and intravenously when heroin is taken parenterally. (See <a href=\"#H515658567\" class=\"local\">'Injection anthrax'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Whatever the portal of entry, infection can lead to disseminated disease; if not treated early, inhalation anthrax does so in all cases. Sites of infection such as the mediastinum, the meninges, and the intestines show hemorrhagic inflammation.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of anthrax are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-anthrax#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of anthrax&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542339127\"><span class=\"h2\">Virulence factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virulent <em>B. anthracis</em> requires a poly-D-glutamic acid capsule and three proteins (edema factor [EF], lethal factor [LF], and protective antigen [PA]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Virulence is enhanced by the cell surface protein BslA, which mediates adhesion to host cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Other virulence factors have been suggested, but induction of specific pathological events by these other factors has not been established.</p><p>Toxin and capsule production are dependent upon the presence of two plasmids:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>pX01 (184.5 kbp) is required for the production of the components of the two exotoxins. Capsule production is also encoded on pX01.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>pX02 (95.3 kbp) contains the genes for synthesis of the poly-D-glutamic acid capsule.</p><p/><p>Infection with anthrax requires the production of two toxins formed by three components: PA, EF, and LF. EF and LF each combine with PA to form the two binary exotoxins, edema toxin (ET) and lethal toxin (LT), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The PA, EF, and LF genes are under the control of AtxA, which is encoded on pX01. The increased CO<sub>2</sub> and HCO<sub>3</sub>- concentrations of the host environment increase AtxA activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The toxins interfere with the host response early in the infection and lead to mortality late in the infection when the bacteria have reached high concentrations in the bloodstream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The poly-D-glutamic acid capsule is antiphagocytic and weakly antigenic. Thus, strains cured of the pX02 plasmid are unencapsulated and are avidly phagocytosed by polymorphonuclear leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Capsule synthesis is under indirect control of AtxA, which induces regulators that in turn control transcription of capsular synthetic genes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3930678789\"><span class=\"h3\">Protective antigen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PA is protective because antibodies to it are highly protective against anthrax infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is the binding moiety for the two toxins and attaches to the surface proteins ANTXR1 (tumor endothelial marker 8) and the similar ANTXR2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Heterogeneity of ANTXR2 may determine different degrees of disease susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Upon attaching to the cell surface, PA is cleaved, allowing for two functions: polymerization into heptamers that form a cation-selective channel in the cell membrane and binding of LF or EF, which enter the cytosol through the channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Fusion to the N-terminal domain of LF allows other proteins to enter the cytosol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Lethal factor and edema factor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LF is a zinc metallo-protease that cleaves mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases 1 and 2, leading to their inactivation and inhibition of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway leads to inhibition of upstream signaling components that mediate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase assembly.</p><p>EF is a calcium-bound calmodulin-stabilized toxin that efficiently converts adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The accumulation of cAMP leads to activation of the kinase A signaling pathway and thus to activation of many cellular functions.</p><p>Early in infection, LF and EF interfere with innate immune functions, allowing the organism to multiply and disseminate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Early on, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells are affected. In neutrophils, recruitment, chemotaxis, priming, phagocytosis, cytokine production, and superoxide production are suppressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. The toxins inhibit recruitment by macrophages and mechanisms by which macrophages kill bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Macrophages and dendritic cells succumb to activation of caspase 1 and programmed cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. A study of organ-specific and whole-body metabolomics in mice also reflected alterations in lipid metabolism associated with dysfunction of innate immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. As a result of effects on innate immunity, <em>B. anthracis</em> multiplies to high concentrations in lymph nodes and blood with a likely lethal outcome if this stage is reached. As an example, during the 12-hour period preceding death of guinea pigs infected with anthrax bacilli, the number of bacteria in the blood rose from 300,000 to one billion <span class=\"nowrap\">organisms/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In late disseminated anthrax, the toxins are widely active at inaccessible intracellular locations and treatment does not assure a good outcome. Toxin levels in blood are also very high during this stage. In guinea pigs, if antibiotics are given after intravascular bacterial concentrations reach one million <span class=\"nowrap\">organisms/mL,</span> the animals still die despite a marked reduction in these concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Furthermore, sterile blood from these guinea pigs reproduces a fatal toxemic syndrome when given to normal guinea pigs. Both ET and LT lead to vascular collapse in experimental animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. ET induces multiorgan hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. ET and LT are toxic to essentially all cell types and study of host metabolomics indicates that many metabolic pathways are affected in vivo even early in the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], but studies in PA-receptor knockout mice have indicated which organs are the most damaged at least in mice. Intuitively, it might seem that given the hypotension and edema seen in anthrax, vascular endothelium would be a major type of tissue to fail, but this does not appear to be the case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In mice, myocardium and smooth muscle are the primary targets of LT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>], but LT also induces lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. ET is less well studied in this model. It is thought to have widespread effects, but one study suggests that ET-induced lethality occurs via its effects on hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immune response to high-level anthrax exposure was evaluated in persons exposed or possibly exposed to anthrax when a letter containing anthrax spores was sent to the Senate Office Building in the United States in 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. All of these individuals were immediately treated with antibiotics and none developed clinical anthrax, but postexposure antibiotic prophylaxis did not prevent stimulation of the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Antibodies to PA and LF were present in approximately 40 and 14 percent of unvaccinated individuals, respectively, and evidence of cell-mediated immunity to PA and LF was present in about 80 and 60 percent, respectively. Although the immune responses were generally of low magnitude, there was a dose-response gradient, with immune responses primarily occurring in individuals with higher levels of exposure. (See <a href=\"#H447747671\" class=\"local\">'Bioterrorism'</a> below.)</p><p>The presence of LF in the serum and immune responses were evaluated in 26 patients who developed cutaneous anthrax during an outbreak in Bangladesh in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. LF was detected in acute serum samples from 18 of 26 individuals. Anti-PA immunoglobulin (Ig)G and lethal toxin neutralizing antibodies were detected in the sera from these 18 individuals. Seroconversion to serum anti-PA IgG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lethal toxin neutralizing antibodies occurred only in patients with measurable LF in the serum. Nine of the 18 patients who had LF in the serum and anti-PA IgG had received antimicrobial therapy two to seven days prior to the first sample collection, suggesting that antimicrobial use does not interfere with the development of a humoral immune response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The organism is predominantly a pathogen of mammals, but it can survive and sometimes multiply in soil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Despite the rarity of human cases in the current era, anthrax remains a potential threat for two reasons: anthrax epizootics still occur, and the organism remains an important potential agent of bioterrorism and biological warfare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>B. anthracis</em> can be isolated from soil at sites where anthrax-infected animal carcasses have been, and, when conditions are favorable, it can undergo local multiplication in soil, which in turn increases the risk of infection in grazing animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. The reasons why anthrax bacilli proliferate in soil are not well understood. Studies of agricultural outbreaks have suggested that conditions for multiplication become favorable when the soil pH is above 6.0, the soil is rich in organic matter, and there are major changes in the soil microenvironment, as occurs after abundant rainfall or drought.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365640492\"><span class=\"h3\">Epizootic anthrax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spores can persist in the soil for decades. Surface decontamination is not practical except in unusual circumstances; thus, epizootic anthrax (ie, outbreaks in animals) will continue to occur in highly endemic areas in the developing world, where the use of animal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anthrax-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">anthrax vaccine</a> is not comprehensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. <em>B. anthracis</em> is also endemic in agricultural regions of South and Central America, central and southwestern Asia, and southern and eastern Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Systemic anthrax is primarily a disease of herbivores. Humans become accidentally infected through contact with infected animals or their products. In the 1950s and 1960s, over 80 percent of cases in the United States were related to products that were manufactured from imported goat hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Inhalation anthrax, or wool-sorters' disease, follows the inhalation of anthrax spores generated during the early cleaning of contaminated goat hair.</p><p>During the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries, improvements in industrial hygiene, a decrease in the use of imported, contaminated animal materials, and immunization of at-risk workers resulted in a reduction in the incidence of inhalation anthrax (only 18 cases in the United States) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Before the 2001 bioterrorism attack, the last prior fatal case of anthrax in the United States occurred in 1976 when a weaver by hobby died of inhalational anthrax after working with yarn imported from Pakistan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Epizootic anthrax cases occur rarely in the United States. In 2000, 32 farms in North Dakota in the United States were quarantined because of anthrax: a total of 157 animals died during this epizootic, and a single ranch worker who helped move dead animals developed cutaneous anthrax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365640507\"><span class=\"h4\">Animal hides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the risk of anthrax associated with the handling of animal hides is low, such cases still sporadically occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/6,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,59,60</a>]. As an example, a man in Connecticut in the United States developed cutaneous anthrax in 2007 after processing a contaminated African goat hide to make a traditional drum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. His eight-year-old child also developed cutaneous anthrax despite having had no direct contact with the hide. An investigation revealed widespread contamination of multiple areas of the home with <em>B. anthracis</em>, although all drum-making activities were confined to a backyard shed. In 2009, a 24-year-old woman in New Hampshire in the United States developed gastrointestinal anthrax after briefly playing a contaminated African drum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/6,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,61</a>]. Environmental sampling showed contamination of the drum and the environment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H515658567\"><span class=\"h2\">Injection anthrax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2000, systemic anthrax was reported in a heroin user in Norway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There was a time gap, then an outbreak of anthrax occurred in Scotland spreading to England and Germany between December 2009 and December 2010 among 119 heroin users; there were 47 confirmed cases, 35 probable cases, and 37 possible cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. In 2012 to 2013, there were 70 cases with 26 fatalities in Denmark, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], and cases have continued to occur sporadically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Whole-genome sequencing of 60 isolates has shown multiple strains forming two closely related groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. One group was associated with the 2009 to 2010 outbreak and a different group with the 2012 to 2013 outbreak. Intriguingly, the original isolate from Norway belonged to the second group. Molecular epidemiology has made it possible to determine the geographic origin of <em>B. anthracis</em> isolates, and both clades appear to originate in the Middle East, possibly Turkey, although sequencing of more isolates from that area, including from Afghanistan, the probable source of the heroin, will be necessary to more precisely locate the source. The clinical features are discussed in greater detail separately.

Eleven of these cases were inhalational and 11 cutaneous; all but two inhalational cases resulted from exposure to <em>B. anthracis</em> in a powder that had been sent through the mail, and most of the inhalational cases occurred in postal employees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Two unexpected findings resulted from the investigations of these bioterrorism cases. First, airborne dissemination of anthrax spores occurred from sealed envelopes during their travel through high-speed mail sorting machines. Second, re-aerosolization of infective spores occurred long after airborne spores had settled onto surfaces.</p><p>Twenty-five days after the Senate Office Building was closed, a study was conducted in the office of a United States senator who had received an envelope that was opened by his staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Individuals wearing sterile protective suits initially placed sampling devices around the office suite and then left the area. Later they returned to the contaminated areas and simulated office activity such as walking, sorting mail, and moving trash cans. Airborne spore concentrations increased 65-fold during the simulated active period, proving that re-aerosolization of anthrax spores is possible.</p><p>Analysis of variable-number tandem repeat segments of DNA indicated that the Ames strain had been used in these attacks. This strain had been used widely by the United States military in biodefense research and distributed minimally to nonmilitary laboratories. Civilian laboratories were eliminated as the source by a criminal investigation. Comparing whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in the spores sent in the mail with SNPs from laboratory samples, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) implicated Bruce Ivins, a biodefense researcher working at the United States Army Medical Research Institute in Frederick, Maryland. The case was never submitted to the scrutiny of a court of law since the researcher committed suicide before the case could be tried [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In 2011, a panel of experts assembled by the National Academy of Sciences evaluated the genetic analysis of the anthrax spores and advised that the scientific evidence put forth by the FBI was insufficient to prove that Ivins was the culprit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H442512349\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory accident</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In March 2002, an unvaccinated laboratory worker in Texas in the United States developed cutaneous anthrax after handling agar plate cultures and anthrax-containing vials of environmental samples of <em>B. anthracis</em> as part of the investigation of the bioterrorist attack of 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-anthrax/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

While no worker was infected and the risk was low, the incident precipitated major investigations and great concern about safety practices in the United States network of bio-containment units.

The life cycle of the organism was unraveled by Koch, who recognized the importance of dormant anthrax spores in the perpetuation of the organism in soil. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>B. anthracis</em> is a sporulating gram-positive rod. Virulent <em>B. anthracis</em> requires a poly-D-glutamic acid capsule and three proteins (edema factor [EF], lethal factor [LF], and protective antigen [PA]) that associate into two protein exotoxins. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>B. anthracis</em> has the potential to invade the body by four routes: gastrointestinal, transcutaneous, pulmonary, and direct parenteral injection. Whatever the portal of entry, infection can lead to disseminated disease; if not treated early, inhalation anthrax does so in all cases. (See <a href=\"#H2581166839\" class=\"local\">'Portals of entry and dissemination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal anthrax follows ingestion of contaminated and undercooked meat. Following ingestion, anthrax bacilli are transported to mesenteric lymph nodes. Subsequently, hemorrhagic mesenteric adenitis, ascites, and septicemia may occur. (See <a href=\"#H2581166839\" class=\"local\">'Portals of entry and dissemination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When introduced subcutaneously, spores of virulent <em>B. anthracis</em> become vegetative organisms and begin to multiply. Subsequent production of an antiphagocytic capsule facilitates local spread, and exotoxin production produces extensive brawny edema and tissue necrosis, which are the hallmarks of cutaneous anthrax. (See <a href=\"#H2581166839\" class=\"local\">'Portals of entry and dissemination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spores between 1 and 5 microns in size are deposited in alveolar ducts or alveoli. These spores are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and transported to mediastinal lymph nodes, where they multiply and cause a hemorrhagic mediastinitis. Bacteremia and meningitis are frequent complications after mediastinal infection has become established. (See <a href=\"#H2581166839\" class=\"local\">'Portals of entry and dissemination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The organism has two distinct niches in which it can survive and grow: the soil and mammals, including humans. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>B. anthracis</em> can be part of normal soil flora, and, when conditions are favorable, it can undergo local multiplication, which in turn increases the risk of infection in grazing animals. Humans become accidentally infected through contact with infected animals or their products. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Natural infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2001 in the United States, 22 cases of anthrax, 18 confirmed and 4 suspected, resulted from attempts to deliberately expose selected individuals or organizations to weaponized anthrax spores. Eleven of these cases were inhalational and 11 cutaneous; all but two inhalational cases resulted from exposure to <em>B. anthracis</em> in a powder that had been sent through the mail, and most of the inhalational cases occurred in postal employees. (See <a href=\"#H447747671\" class=\"local\">'Bioterrorism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large outbreaks of anthrax occurred in heroin users in Europe in 2009 to 2010 and 2012 to 2013, causing skin and soft tissue infections in most patients. Additional cases have been reported in heroin users in Europe subsequently. Two separate contamination events appear to have occurred.
