The goal of the evaluation is to assess the severity of the bleed, identify potential sources of the bleed, and determine if there are conditions present that may affect subsequent management. The information gathered as part of the initial evaluation is used to guide decisions regarding triage, resuscitation, empiric medical therapy, and diagnostic testing.</p><p>Factors that are predictive of a bleed coming from an upper GI source identified in a meta-analysis included a patient-reported history of melena (likelihood ratio [LR] 5.1-5.9), melenic stool on examination (LR 25), blood or coffee grounds detected during nasogastric lavage (LR 9.6), and a ratio of blood urea nitrogen to serum creatinine greater than 30 (LR 7.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. On the other hand, the presence of blood clots in the stool made an upper GI source less likely (LR 0.05). Factors associated with severe bleeding included red blood detected during nasogastric lavage (LR 3.1), tachycardia (LR 4.9), or a hemoglobin level of less than 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (LR 4.5-6.2). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H683979\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematemesis (either red blood or coffee-ground emesis) suggests bleeding proximal to the ligament of Treitz. The presence of frankly bloody emesis suggests moderate to severe bleeding that may be ongoing, whereas coffee-ground emesis suggests more limited bleeding.</p><p>The majority of melena (black, tarry stool) originates proximal to the ligament of Treitz (90 percent), though it may also originate from the oropharynx or nasopharynx, small bowel, or right colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

However, it can occur with massive upper GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], which is typically associated with orthostatic hypotension.

In addition, the patient's past medical history should be reviewed to identify important comorbid conditions that may lead to upper GI bleeding or may influence the patient's subsequent management. </p><p>Potential bleeding sources suggested by a patient's past medical history include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy in a patient with a history of liver disease or alcohol abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aorto-enteric fistula in a patient with a history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or an aortic graft</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiodysplasia in a patient with renal disease, aortic stenosis, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peptic ulcer disease in a patient with a history of <em>Helicobacter pylori </em>infection, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs) use, or smoking </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancy in a patient with a history of smoking, alcohol abuse, or <em>H. pylori</em> infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marginal ulcers (ulcers at an anastomotic site) in a patient with a gastroenteric anastomosis</p><p/><p>Comorbid illnesses may influence patient management in the setting of an acute upper GI bleed.

In a series of 80 patients with severe hematochezia (red or maroon blood in the stool), 74 percent had a colonic lesion, 11 percent had an upper GI lesion, 9 percent had a presumed small bowel source, and no site was identified in 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nasogastric lavage may be carried out if there is doubt as to whether a bleed originates from the upper GI tract. (See <a href=\"#H5079470\" class=\"local\">'Nasogastric lavage'</a> below.)</p><p>The presence of abdominal pain, especially if severe and associated with rebound tenderness or involuntary guarding, raises concern for perforation. If any signs of an acute abdomen are present, further evaluation to exclude a perforation is required prior to endoscopy. </p><p>Finally, as with the past medical history, the physical examination should include a search for evidence of significant comorbid illnesses. (See <a href=\"#H684310\" class=\"local\">'Past medical history'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5079205\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory tests that should be obtained in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding include a complete blood count, serum chemistries, liver tests, and coagulation studies. In addition, serial electrocardiograms and cardiac enzymes may be indicated in patients who are at risk for a myocardial infarction, such as older adults, patients with a history of coronary artery disease, or patients with symptoms such as chest pain or dyspnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial hemoglobin level in patients with acute upper GI bleeding will often be at the patient's baseline because the patient is losing whole blood. With time (typically after 24 hours or more) the hemoglobin level will decline as the blood is diluted by the influx of extravascular fluid into the vascular space and by fluid administered during resuscitation. It should be kept in mind that excessive volume administration can lead to a falsely low hemoglobin value. The initial hemoglobin level is monitored every two to eight hours, depending upon the severity of the bleed.</p><p>Patients with acute bleeding should have normocytic red blood cells. Microcytic red blood cells or iron deficiency anemia suggest chronic bleeding. Because blood is absorbed as it passes through the small bowel and patients may have decreased renal perfusion, patients with acute upper GI bleeding typically have an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN)-to-creatinine or urea-to-creatinine ratio. Values &gt;36:1 or &gt;100:1, respectively, suggest upper GI bleeding as the cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The higher the ratio, the more likely the bleeding is from an upper GI source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5079470\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasogastric lavage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether all patients with suspected acute upper GI bleeding require nasogastric tube (NGT) placement is controversial, in part because studies have failed to demonstrate a benefit with regard to clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study looked at whether there were clinical benefits from NGT lavage in 632 patients admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients who underwent NGT lavage were matched with patients with similar characteristics who did not undergo NGT lavage. NGT lavage was associated with a shorter time to endoscopy. However, there were no differences between those who underwent NGT lavage and those who did not with regard to mortality, length of hospital stay, surgery, or transfusion requirement. Similarly, in a randomized trial with 280 patients with upper GI bleeding, there were no differences in rebleeding rates or mortality between patients who underwent NGT lavage and those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>More often, NGT lavage is used when it is unclear if a patient has ongoing bleeding and thus might benefit from an early endoscopy. In addition, NGT lavage can be used to remove particulate matter, fresh blood, and clots from the stomach to facilitate endoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nasogastric-and-nasoenteric-tubes#H522921948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nasogastric and nasoenteric tubes&quot;, section on 'Tube placement'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of red blood or coffee ground material in the nasogastric aspirate also confirms an upper GI source of bleeding and predicts whether the bleeding is caused by a lesion at increased risk for ongoing or recurrent bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>]. However, lavage may not be positive if bleeding has ceased or arises beyond a closed pylorus. Nasogastric aspiration of nonbloody bilious fluid suggests that the pylorus is open and that there is no active upper GI bleeding distal to the pylorus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>We suggest that patients only undergo NGT lavage if particulate matter, fresh blood, or clots need to be removed from the stomach to facilitate endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5079565\"><span class=\"h2\">Triage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with hemodynamic instability (shock, orthostatic hypotension) or active bleeding (manifested by hematemesis, bright red blood per nasogastric tube, or hematochezia) should be admitted to an intensive care unit for resuscitation and close observation with automated blood pressure monitoring, electrocardiographic monitoring, and pulse oximetry.</p><p>A table outlining the emergency management of acute severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72195\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72195 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Other patients can be admitted to a regular medical ward, though we suggest that all admitted patients with the exception of low-risk patients receive electrocardiographic monitoring. Outpatient management may be appropriate for some low-risk patients. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5079990\"><span class=\"h2\">General support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should receive supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula and should receive nothing per mouth. Two large caliber (18 gauge or larger) peripheral intravenous catheters or a central venous line should be inserted.</p><p>Elective endotracheal intubation in patients with ongoing hematemesis or altered respiratory or mental status may facilitate endoscopy and decrease the risk of aspiration. However, among patients who are critically ill, elective endotracheal intubation has been associated with worse outcomes. A case control study with 200 patients with upper GI bleeding who were critically ill found that patients who had elective endotracheal intubation were more likely than patients who were not intubated to have adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes based on a composite outcome that included pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Of note, the presence of respiratory distress prior to intubation was not reported and the mean Glasgow Coma Scale score was 14.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">(+/-</span> 0.95), indicating that altered mental status was absent in the majority of patients. Patients who were electively intubated were more likely to suffer cardiopulmonary complications compared with patients who were not intubated (20.0 versus 6.0 percent). In particular, patients who were intubated were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia within 48 hours (14.0 versus 2.0 percent). Pending additional studies in broader patient populations, our approach is still to proceed with intubation in patients deemed high-risk for aspiration, including those with massive upper GI bleeding or altered mental status. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5079572\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate resuscitation and hemodynamic stabilization is essential prior to endoscopy to minimize treatment-associated complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients with active bleeding should receive intravenous fluids (eg, 500 mL of normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution over 30 minutes) while being typed and cross-matched for blood transfusion. Patients at risk of fluid overload may require intensive monitoring. </p><p>If the blood pressure fails to respond to initial resuscitation efforts, the rate of fluid administration should be increased. In some patients, temporary support with vasopressor drugs may be required. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5079586\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood product transfusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to initiate blood transfusions must be individualized. Our approach is to initiate blood transfusions if the hemoglobin is &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (70 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> for most patients (including those with stable coronary artery disease), with a goal of maintaining the hemoglobin at a level &ge;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (70 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/4,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20-22</a>]. However, our goal is to maintain the hemoglobin at a level of &ge;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (90 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> for patients at increased risk of suffering adverse events in the setting of significant anemia, such as those with unstable coronary artery disease or in those with evidence of ongoing active bleeding. We do not have an age cutoff for determining which patients should have a goal hemoglobin of &ge;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (90 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L),</span> and instead base the decision on the patient's comorbid conditions. Patients with active bleeding and hypovolemia may require blood transfusion despite an apparently normal hemoglobin. (See <a href=\"#H5079205\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory data'</a> above.)</p><p>It is particularly important to avoid overtransfusion in patients with suspected variceal bleeding, as it can precipitate worsening of the bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/21,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23-26</a>].

Patients with a coagulopathy that is not due to cirrhosis and with a prolonged prothrombin time with INR &gt;1.5 should generally be transfused with fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The management of coagulopathies in patients with cirrhosis is more complicated because the INR is not an accurate measure of hemostasis in patients with cirrhosis because it only reflects changes in procoagulant factors. The management of coagulopathies in patients with cirrhosis who have acute bleeding is discussed separately.

However, in patients with an INR &ge;3, we attempt to correct the INR to &lt;3 prior to starting an endoscopy, with additional FFP being given after the endoscopy if high-risk stigmata for recurrent bleeding were found or if endoscopic therapy was performed and the INR is still &gt;1.5. This approach is based on data that suggest endoscopy is safe in patients who are mildly to moderately anticoagulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, because packed red blood cells do not contain coagulation factors, transfusion of a unit of FFP should be considered after every four units of packed red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Confirming the presence of blood in the stomach or duodenum may aid with patient triage and identify patients more likely to benefit from early endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/67-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-71</a>].

In a study that included 1743 colonoscopies performed for the evaluation of melena following a non-diagnostic upper endoscopy, a suspected bleeding source was identified in 5 percent of patients, a rate that was higher than that seen in 194,979 average-risk screening controls (1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].
