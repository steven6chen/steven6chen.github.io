The incidence and severity of asthma are high and increasing. Asthmatic patients often present for surgery and anesthesia and can pose challenges for the anesthesiologist, especially when endotracheal intubation is required.</p><p>Wheezing can happen at any time during anesthesia, most commonly during induction of general anesthesia after endotracheal intubation. If it occurs, it is usually transient and treated without sequelae. However, bronchospasm can be severe and may result in significant morbidity or even mortality.</p><p>This topic will discuss preoperative assessment and preparation of adult patients with asthma and intraoperative management. Evaluation and management of asthma is discussed in more depth separately.

Postoperative pulmonary complications are most common following thoracic surgery, upper abdominal surgery, open aortic aneurysm repair, neurosurgery, and surgery on the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-asthma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

However, retrospective analysis suggests that perioperative bronchospasm and laryngospasm are more likely in patients who used asthma medications, noted asthma symptoms, or visited a medical facility for asthma treatment within the past year, particularly if within 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-asthma/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H435169636\"><span class=\"h3\">Recent upper respiratory infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Timing of anesthesia and elective surgery for the asthmatic patient with a URI is a difficult issue that depends on the severity of the patient's asthma, the degree of asthma control, and the implications for delay of surgery.

Baseline pulse oximetry value should be noted. Preoperative pulmonary function testing is usually reserved for patients with moderate to severe asthma undergoing particularly high-risk procedures. In addition, use of asthma medications impacts preoperative laboratory testing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary function testing</strong> &ndash; Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and spirometry are two methods commonly used to evaluate lung function in asthmatics. PEFR can be measured with a handheld peak flow meter at home or in the preadmission test clinic, and many moderate or severe asthmatics use it to monitor their disease. A peak flow &gt;80 percent of predicted suggests that asthma is well controlled. However, there is wide variability in PEFR; a one-time measurement may not be useful for evaluating airway obstruction. In general, a PEFR &le;80 percent of predicted should be evaluated further with spirometry, unless the value is known to be consistent with good control in that individual.

Intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> (100 mg every eight hours) can be used as an alternative for patients unable to tolerate oral medications.

Additional studies have looked at the incidence of perioperative complications in asthmatic patients who received systemic glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-asthma/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In particular, preoperative systemic glucocorticoids have not been shown to increase postoperative infections, wound infection, delayed wound healing, or asthma exacerbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-asthma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234674322\"><span class=\"h1\">PREMEDICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most asthmatic patients benefit from premedication to decrease anxiety prior to anesthesia since anxiety can precipitate bronchospasm. The use of premedications to dry secretions is variable. In addition, asthmatic patients should receive short-acting beta<sub>2</sub> agonist therapy by either multidose inhaler (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> two to four puffs) or nebulizer (albuterol 2.5 mg) 20 to 30 minutes prior to airway manipulation.</p><p>Sedatives and narcotics should be titrated to effect, aiming to avoid oversedation and respiratory depression. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Midazolam</a> in small, incremental doses (eg, 0.5 mg) will be effective for many patients. For those patients who require potentially painful procedures prior to anesthetic induction (eg, placement of an intraarterial or epidural catheter), small doses of an opioid such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> may be used.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dexmedetomidine</a>, an alpha<sub>2</sub> agonist, achieves anxiolysis, sympatholysis, and drying of secretions without respiratory depression, and may be useful during preoperative procedures.

These agents are considered for patients who will tolerate the tachycardia that may result.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H115102450\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endotracheal intubation is a very potent stimulus for bronchoconstriction. When possible, avoidance of endotracheal intubation should decrease the chance of intraoperative bronchospasm. However, bronchospasm can occur with any type of anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234674329\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When possible, regional anesthesia is a good anesthetic choice since manipulation of the airway is avoided. Regional anesthesia should be considered for peripheral procedures that can be done with relatively low-level neuraxial anesthesia, either epidural or spinal, or with peripheral nerve blocks. The following two types of regional anesthesia require special consideration:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuraxial anesthesia</strong> &ndash; Midthoracic or higher levels of neuraxial anesthesia can result in paralysis of accessory muscles of breathing. Asthmatic patients may depend on active exhalation for adequate gas exchange, and high levels of sensory or motor block may provoke anxiety and precipitate bronchospasm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brachial plexus blocks</strong> &ndash; Some brachial plexus blocks for upper extremity surgery paralyze the diaphragm by blocking the phrenic nerve, potentially for many hours, which may not be tolerated by patients with respiratory compromise.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234674336\"><span class=\"h2\">General anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General anesthesia may be associated with increased risk of bronchospasm. In this setting, bronchospasm occurs most commonly because of mechanical stimulation of the airway during laryngoscopy, endotracheal intubation, or extubation (as the depth of anesthesia necessarily lightens). In addition, bronchospasm can result from airway suctioning, inhalation of cold anesthetic gases, pulmonary aspiration of stomach contents, or as a side effect of some medications administered in the perioperative period. Also, airway tone may increase because of vagally stimulating events such as peritoneal insufflation during laparoscopy, manipulation of viscera, or endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234674343\"><span class=\"h1\">INDUCTION OF ANESTHESIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234674350\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A goal of induction of anesthesia in the asthmatic patient is to minimize the risk of a bronchoconstrictive response to airway management. While the risk of bronchospasm is lower with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or mask ventilation compared with endotracheal intubation, decisions regarding placement of an LMA or an endotracheal tube (ETT) should be similar to patients without asthma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A randomized trial compared LMA with endotracheal intubation in 52 adults undergoing elective surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-asthma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients taking bronchodilators were excluded. The initial increase in airway resistance with endotracheal intubation did not occur with LMA placement, though after 10 minutes of inhalation anesthesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a> there was no difference in airway resistance.</p><p>Importantly, airway suctioning should be done only as necessary and only under a deep level of anesthesia.

This is particularly important in the patient with asthma.
