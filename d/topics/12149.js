They are stronger than pain medicines you can buy without a prescription.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H807211001\"><span class=\"h1\">What do doctors prescribe opioids for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioids are used for treating pain in people who have cancer or other long-term conditions. Doctors also prescribe them to relieve severe pain that lasts for a few days, like after an operation. This type of pain is called &quot;short-term&quot; pain. Short-term pain can happen after:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A major dental procedure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serious injury, such as a broken bone or other injury from a car accident</p><p/><p>Not everyone needs an opioid medicine in these situations. Your doctor will decide if your pain requires treatment with an opioid.</p><p>This article is about what you need to know if you take opioids for <strong>short-term</strong> pain relief. If your doctor prescribes an opioid that releases medicine into the body slowly over time, such as a skin patch or &quot;extended-release&quot; pill, there will be different instructions and cautions. If you take opioid medicines for pain caused by cancer, this is discussed in a different article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1341666491\"><span class=\"h1\">Are opioid medicines safe?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioids are generally safe if you take them only when needed for severe pain, and only for a short time. A short time means a few days or a week. They can help you recover more comfortably from your operation or injury, and get back to your usual activities.</p><p>However, opioids are <strong>dangerous</strong> if they are not used correctly. If they are misused, for example if you take them when you don't really need them for severe pain, there is a risk of getting addicted. Also, if you take too much at once, or take them with alcohol or certain other drugs, opioids can cause serious harm or even death from overdose.</p><p>There is more information below on how to use opioid medicines safely. It's important to read the entire handout carefully.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3194029012\"><span class=\"h1\">What are common opioid medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For short-term relief of severe pain, many people get a prescription for a low dose of an opioid medicine. Opioid medicines used for this include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">oxycodone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydromorphone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-and-acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydrocodone-acetaminophen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tramadol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">codeine</a>. These opioids come as &quot;immediate-release&quot; pills, meaning they work fast to relieve pain. They are also available as liquids, suppositories, and shots for people who cannot swallow pills. The table shows different opioids used for short-term pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F114596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114596 \">table 1</a>). Opioids also come as &quot;extended-release&quot; pills, patches, lozenges, and sprays. Those type of opioids are used for treating long-term pain, and are <strong>not</strong> covered in this article.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H719789868\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my doctor prescribe more than 1 pain medicine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor might recommend that you also take another pain reliever along with the opioid. This might include an &quot;NSAID&quot; such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol). That way, you can use less opioid pain medicine, and use the opioid only when an NSAID or acetaminophen is not enough to relieve your pain. For example, some patients with short-term pain get enough relief by taking 1 opioid pill in the morning and 1 in the evening, as long as they take their NSAID or acetaminophen 2 or 3 times a day, too.</p><p>Before you try other pain medicines, it's important to know that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with certain medical conditions should not take NSAIDs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a>. Talk to your doctor before you try this, to make sure your medicines are safe for you and you are getting the right doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some opioid medicines come already combined with an NSAID or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a>. If your medicine has both, you should not take any extra NSAIDs or acetaminophen without talking to your doctor first. Make sure you know what is in each of your medicines and when to take them.</p><p/><p>Your doctor might also suggest other ways to help reduce pain without medicine, such as ice, heat, rest, or relaxation exercises. In some cases, medicines that numb one part of the body can help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H398708471\"><span class=\"h1\">How do opioids work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioids relieve pain by blocking pain signals in the nervous system. They also reduce anxiety and stress caused by pain. Opioids also block other nerve signals in the body, which causes side effects. For example, if you take too much of an opioid it can cause slow or shallow breathing.</p><p>Opioids can make some people feel relaxed and happy for a short time. This makes some people want to take more and more, which can lead to problems. More information about this is below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4129717641\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to use opioids safely to treat my pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioids can be used safely, but they have many risks, so it's important to be careful. There are things you can do to use your medicine safely and help protect yourself and others:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take <strong>only</strong> the amount your doctor prescribes, and only as often as he or she tells you to. Different people need different doses. Never take opioids that were not prescribed to you. Talk to your doctor or nurse if you think your opioids are not helping enough with your pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do <strong>not</strong> drink alcohol while you are taking opioids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do <strong>not</strong> take opioids with medicines that make you sleepy, or with any other medicines, unless your doctor tells you to.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do <strong>not </strong>drive a car, use dangerous machinery, or do other risky activities while taking an opioid medicine. Opioids can make you feel tired or have trouble thinking clearly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Store your opioids in a safe place, such as a locked cabinet. This will prevent children, teenagers, or anyone else from getting to them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When your pain gets better, get rid of any leftover medicines. But don't just throw them in the regular trash. Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can suggest ways to get rid of them. This might involve flushing them down the toilet, or mixing them with something like dirt or cat litter before putting the mixture in the trash. Some police stations and pharmacies also take unused or leftover medicines.</p><p/><p>Try to get all of your pain medicines from the same doctor. If that is not possible, be sure all of your doctors know <strong>every</strong> medicine you take, even those that are non-prescription. Bring a complete list of all of your pain medicines and other medicines with you whenever you go to a doctor, nurse, dentist, or pharmacist.</p><p>If you have a history of drug abuse, it's best to <strong>avoid</strong> opioids completely if possible. Your doctor can help you find ways to treat your pain without an opioid. You might also talk to a doctor who is an expert in understanding and treating pain, called a &quot;pain specialist.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H882443603\"><span class=\"h1\">Do opioids have side effects?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><strong>Yes</strong>. Opioids can cause some side effects that are just bothersome, and some that are dangerous.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dangerous side effects</strong> &ndash; If you have taken too much of an opioid medicine or think someone is having a drug overdose, immediately <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> or get the person to the hospital. Do this if a person:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Can't seem to wake up or seems very drowsy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Becomes very confused</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is breathing very slowly or stops breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Passes out or have seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Becomes unable to urinate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Emergency responders can treat an opioid overdose with a drug called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naloxone</a>.&quot; This can save the person's life. But it needs to be given as soon as possible to work.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bothersome side effects</strong> &ndash; Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have any of these side effects and they bother you:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Constipation &ndash; Your doctor or nurse might suggest you take medicines to prevent or treat constipation. It's also important to drink plenty of water.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nausea, vomiting, or itchiness &ndash; If you have any of these problems, your doctor might be able to switch you to a different medicine.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dry mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling dizzy or sleepy, or having trouble thinking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vision problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling clumsy or falling down</p><p/><p>If you suddenly stop taking your opioid after taking it around the clock for several days, you might have unpleasant symptoms called &quot;withdrawal.&quot; This can include a stomachache, diarrhea, or shakes. If you have been taking opioids regularly for several days or longer, ask your doctor if you need to reduce your dose gradually.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2469694662\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I worry about addiction?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, taking opioids can lead to abuse or addiction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Abuse&quot; means taking an opioid in a way that is different than your doctor directed. Doctors also use the term &quot;misuse.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Addiction&quot; is when a person can't control his or her use of a drug or medicine. A person who is addicted to opioids might use more than they planned to. They might need higher doses to get the same effect they used to get with fewer pills or a lower dose. Or they might want to stop or cut down on their drug use, but not be able to.</p><p/><p>This risk of opioid addiction is higher for people who have problems with drug or alcohol use. It's rare to get addicted to opioids if you are taking them short-term for severe pain only when you need them and following all of your doctor's instructions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H882443650\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Taking opioids during pregnancy can cause serious problems for both the mother and the baby. If you are pregnant, your doctor or nurse can help you find other ways to manage your pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H882443665\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescription-drug-misuse-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prescription drug misuse (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-use-disorder-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Opioid use disorder (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-after-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain after surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-medicines-when-youre-older-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking medicines when you're older (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
