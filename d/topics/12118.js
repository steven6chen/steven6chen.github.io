BCS followed by radiation treatment comprises breast-conserving therapy (BCT). The goals of BCT are to provide the survival equivalent of mastectomy, a cosmetically acceptable breast, and a low rate of recurrence in the treated breast. </p><p>BCT is appropriate for most women with early-stage breast cancer, although there are clear contraindications to it, such as extensive or multicentric disease and persistently positive surgical resection margins. For breast conservation to be maximally effective, the cancer must be resected with adequate surgical margins while simultaneously maintaining the breast's shape and appearance. </p><p>This review will present oncoplastic techniques for breast conservation. The management of early-stage breast cancer and the major issues related to breast conservation techniques for surgical treatment of invasive breast cancer are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101093166\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oncoplastic techniques for breast-conserving surgery (BCS) can provide adequate or even wide surgical margins around large <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> segmentally distributed breast cancers using closure techniques that help preserve the shape and appearance of the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These techniques are best suited for the following patients: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the cancer resection is large in relation to the size of the breast. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The conventional approach to obliterating the postexcision cavity risks significant long-term cosmetic deformities once 20 percent or more of the breast volume has been excised. These deformities include dimpling of the skin and displacement of the nipple-areolar complex. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oncoplastic techniques allow for removal of between 200 and 1000 grams of breast tissue without causing significant breast deformity by advancing breast tissue to obliterate the postexcision cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The use of oncoplastic techniques, therefore, broadens the application of BCS to patients with larger tumors who would otherwise have to undergo mastectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the cancer location requires repositioning of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC). Oncoplastic techniques can maintain a natural breast appearance and reduce breast ptosis.</p><p/><p>Oncoplastic techniques are generally not required for excision of smaller cancers in adequately sized breasts. The conventional lumpectomy generally removes 20 to 40 grams of breast tissue, with adverse cosmetic outcomes only typically seen when 80 grams or more of breast tissue are removed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14027026\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION AND PREOPERATIVE CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Selection criteria</strong> &ndash; Oncoplastic techniques are appropriate for most breast preservation candidates. The selection criteria for breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and postoperative radiation therapy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;, section on 'Selection criteria for BCT'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tissue biopsy</strong> &ndash; Tissue biopsy of all suspicious areas of the breast, preferably using core needle sampling, should be performed, and conclusive proof of malignancy should be documented. Every effort should be made to make the tissue diagnosis by needle sampling, to reduce unnecessary surgery and because an excisional biopsy scar may complicate the placement of the subsequent BCS incision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging</strong> &ndash; Radiographic imaging (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) may help the surgeon determine if the cancer can be resected with negative margins. An alternative approach for large cancers not amenable to BCS is the administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which may decrease the size of the cancer and provide the opportunity for the patient to avoid a mastectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Preoperative assessment of the extent of disease is discussed elsewhere.

For complex oncoplastic approaches, plastic surgery consultation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraoperative collaboration should be arranged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Often the plastic surgeon will perform a contralateral breast lift or reduction to ensure breast symmetry at the same operative setting if it is highly likely the margins of resection will be clear of cancer. In the settings of uncertainty of margin status of BCS, a delay for any procedure of the contralateral breast is advised until the final pathology report is available.

The use of multiple wires can delineate the extent of the larger or segmentally distributed cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;, section on 'Margins of resection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evaluation of the axilla </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Evaluation of the axilla provides important information for treatment decisions in patients with invasive breast cancer. The management of the regional lymph nodes in breast cancer, sentinel node biopsy, and axillary dissection are discussed elsewhere. Oncoplastic approaches can be safely combined with axillary staging of any type. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the regional lymph nodes in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin marking</strong> &ndash; Skin landmarks should be marked preoperatively with the patient in the upright sitting position for both breasts. These sites may be challenging to accurately locate once the patient is anesthetized and lying supine on the operating room table. Special attention should be given to scars from prior breast surgery, including the placement and location of breast implants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relevant landmarks to be identified and marked include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The inframammary crease </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The anterior axillary fold at the pectoralis major muscle </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The posterior axillary fold of the latissimus dorsi muscle </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The sternal border of the breast </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The periareolar circle </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The superior border of the breast</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1075282222\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGEON'S SAFETY CHECKLIST FOR ONCOPLASTIC SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To avoid surgical complications, the breast surgeon should review and assess the patient's medical status. A preoperative checklist is a good way to assure that all safety issues have been addressed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59666\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59666 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The patient should be counseled regarding the risks of bleeding and infection, breast asymmetry, loss of sensation, seroma formation, fat necrosis, delayed healing, nipple necrosis, and the possibility of needing additional surgery for close or positive surgical margins. If concurrent axillary surgery is planned, the complications of sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection should be discussed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the regional lymph nodes in breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Surgical complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Review films </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The patient's films should be reviewed with the radiologist and displayed in the operating room. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anesthesia </strong>&ndash; Oncoplastic surgery requires extensive mobilization and advancement of breast tissue, thus requiring general anesthesia. If concurrent axillary surgery is planned, the patient should <strong>not</strong> be paralyzed until the axillary portion of the surgery is completed so that testing of the large motor nerves during dissection is possible. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antibiotics </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>A preoperative antibiotic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a>, should be administered within one hour before making the incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis decreases if administered more than one hour before surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79097 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials of preoperative antibiotics versus placebo in patients undergoing breast surgery found that the use of preoperative antibiotics was associated with a significant reduction in infection (relative risk = 0.60; 95% CI 0.45-0.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

The general principles common to all oncoplastic techniques include resecting a skin island associated with the fibroglandular tissue inclusive of the cancer and advancing the deep fibroglandular tissues over the chest wall to obliterate the postresection defect. </p><p>The most widely utilized oncoplastic techniques include lateral segmentectomy, batwing mastopexy, central breast-conserving surgery (BCS), reduction mastopexy, and donut mastopexy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>]. These techniques are variations of an elliptical or rhomboid resection, a plastic surgery technique commonly used for the removal of large skin or soft tissue lesions. </p><p>Primarily supplied by the axillary, intercostal, and internal mammary arteries, the fibroglandular tissue of the breast has a rich anastomotic circulatory bed, which allows the surgeon to remodel large amounts of breast tissue within the skin envelope without a major risk of devascularization or necrosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H370584485\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all oncoplastic techniques, the patient is positioned supine with her arms extended on arm boards at &le;90 degree abduction from the chest wall. Arm positioning with &gt;90 degrees of abduction from the chest wall increases the potential for stretching the brachial plexus and should be avoided. It is important to position the arm while the patient is awake to make sure the arm is not abducted beyond what is comfortable for the patient, especially if there are preexisting problems with shoulder mobility. If a sentinel node biopsy or axillary dissection is also planned, the ipsilateral arm can be included in the prepped field at the discretion of the surgeon, allowing the arm to be mobilized during the procedure. The lateral chest wall should be positioned along the edge of the operating table. </p><p>It is preferable to have both breasts prepped and draped into the field so that visual comparison with the patient in a sitting position is possible as the wound is closed. This positioning allows the surgeon to identify areas of unsightly tugging or dimpling inadvertently created during closure, so that they can be addressed at that time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H370584848\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of oncoplastic technique is based upon the location of the cancer in the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643976978\"><span class=\"h3\">Superior pole or lateral cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a superior pole or lateral breast cancer, a full-thickness fibroglandular resection including an overlying skin island with an advancement closure is the simplest and most commonly employed technique. (See <a href=\"#H14027088\" class=\"local\">'Parallelogram skin incision'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643976971\"><span class=\"h3\">Lower pole breast cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For lower pole (inner and outer quadrant) breast cancers, including those at the three and nine o'clock positions, a lateral segmentectomy or reduction mastopexy can be considered depending on the breast size. A lateral segmentectomy is more appropriate for a small breast, while a reduction mastopexy would be more appropriate for a larger breast. (See <a href=\"#H14027095\" class=\"local\">'Lateral segmentectomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14027116\" class=\"local\">'Reduction mastopexy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643976964\"><span class=\"h3\">Centrally located cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a centrally located breast cancer with associated nipple involvement, a central BCS with removal of the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) provides an alternative to a mastectomy. However, central BCS procedures may result in an inadequate projection of smaller breasts and limit future options for reconstruction. Rotating the NAC, such that the incision results in an inverted T, may preserve breast shape and prevent the flattening that can occur with more horizontally placed central lumpectomy incisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For centrally located breast cancer without nipple involvement, the batwing mastopexy also allows resection of cancers adjacent to or deep to the NAC without sacrifice of the nipple itself. (See <a href=\"#H14027109\" class=\"local\">'Central breast resection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14027102\" class=\"local\">'Batwing mastopexy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643976957\"><span class=\"h3\">Upper outer quadrant cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For segmentally distributed upper outer quadrant breast cancers, the donut mastopexy can be a more demanding but helpful technique. The donut incision is confined to the periareolar area, keeping the full skin envelope intact. When the cancer is far removed from the nipple complex, the donut mastectomy is less practical, because the major key dissection around the cancer is distant from the incision. In these cases with peripherally located cancers, a parallelogram approach is generally preferred. (See <a href=\"#H14027123\" class=\"local\">'Donut mastopexy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14027088\" class=\"local\">'Parallelogram skin incision'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643976950\"><span class=\"h3\">Upper inner quadrant cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For upper inner quadrant breast cancers, where the breast tissue is the thinnest, a simple reapproximation of breast tissue and skin without removal of the skin is performed. If a small skin island is included with the fibroglandular resection, excessive superomedial displacement of the NAC must be avoided to preserve breast symmetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643977150\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative approach divides oncoplastic surgery into two levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While level one techniques can be easily learned and practiced by most breast surgeons, level two techniques are more advanced and generally require additional training in the field.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643977170\"><span class=\"h3\">Level one</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Level one resections can be accomplished without major nipple relocation (ie, mammoplasty).

Level two resections can remove 20 to 50 percent of breast volume, after which closure is achieved by mammoplasty techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The description of level two techniques is beyond the scope of this topic, and their use is generally reserved for advanced oncoplastic surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643977056\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most widely utilized oncoplastic surgical techniques include parallelogram incision, lateral segmentectomy, batwing mastopexy, central BCS, reduction mastopexy, and donut mastopexy. These techniques can be used alone or in combination with each other to carry out resections of breast lesions depending upon their locations. (See <a href=\"#H370584848\" class=\"local\">'Surgical approach'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14027088\"><span class=\"h3\">Parallelogram skin incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A straightforward method for planning the skin incision is to draw an outline of a parallelogram on the skin. An elongated ellipse or parallelogram incision is made that narrows and rounds the skin incision pattern to create two incisions of equal length that join in a tight &quot;V&quot; that on closure will minimize any degree of &quot;dog ear&quot; deformity at the corners. Removal of the overlying skin prevents skin dimpling or hollowing of the breast. The technique is illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55176\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55176 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>A rounded parallelogram with two equal length lines is drawn, thus marking the skin island to be excised in conjunction with the underlying target lesion and surrounding tissues. The surgeon should be cautious when designing the skin ellipse, because removal of too broad of an island can cause substantial shifting of the NAC. </p><p>Flaps are then raised, and the cancer is resected in standard fashion. Clips are placed, and tissue advancement and closure are then performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284599171\"><span class=\"h4\">Resection, clip placement, tissue advancement, and closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the appropriate incision is made, skin flaps are raised along both sides of the wound, dissection is carried down to the chest wall, the breast tissue and pectoralis fascia are lifted off the pectoralis muscle, and a standard cancer resection is performed. After full-thickness excision of the cancer, four to six marking clips are typically placed at the base of the defect within the surrounding fibroglandular tissue to identify the cancer bed for the radiation oncologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-for-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques for newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The breast tissue is elevated off the chest wall at the plane between the pectoralis muscle and breast gland and advanced to close the defect that results from resection of the cancer. The direction of tissue advancement can be adjusted, depending upon the location of the fibroglandular defect and the excess tissue that can be shifted to close it. The defect is sutured at the deepest edges using interrupted 3-0 absorbable mattress sutures. We typically do not place anchoring stitches into the chest wall, thus allowing the reapproximated breast tissues to move on the chest wall and shift into a natural position when the patient is upright. The subcutaneous tissue is then closed with interrupted absorbable sutures and the skin is closed with absorbable subcuticular sutures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14027095\"><span class=\"h3\">Lateral segmentectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lateral segmentectomy is a variation of the parallelogram-based BCS and is especially useful for cancers located within the lateral breast, including the three and nine o'clock positions. The skin markings and procedure are illustrated in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62843\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62843 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p>The skin parallelogram is placed radially, and, at the corner of the parallelogram that comes closest to the nipple, the design should be positioned such that the closed incision after resection will approach the NAC tangential to the periareolar line. This reduces deviation of the NAC towards the lesion, a condition that can result from scar contraction. This radial approach gives more projection to the nipple, avoiding the downward displacement that can be caused by a purely horizontal scar. </p><p>The remainder of the operation is performed in standard fashion.

This approach can be used in any quadrant of the breast for more centrally located lesions. The batwing approach simultaneously preserves NAC viability and the breast mound by using mastopexy closure to close the resulting fibroglandular defect of the full-thickness resection. As this procedure can cause some lifting of the nipple, it may create asymmetry when compared with the contralateral breast. If desired, a contralateral lift can be performed, either concurrently with the ipsilateral BCS, or after adjuvant radiation has been completed, and the treated breast has &quot;declared&quot; its new size and shape. The skin markings and procedure are illustrated in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74595\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74595 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Two semicircular incisions are made with angled &quot;wings&quot; on each side of the areola. The two half-circles are positioned to allow them to be reapproximated to each other at wound closure. Removal of these skin wings allows the semicircles to be shifted together without creating redundant skin folds at closure. </p><p>The remainder of the operation is performed in standard fashion. (See <a href=\"#H284599171\" class=\"local\">'Resection, clip placement, tissue advancement, and closure'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14027109\"><span class=\"h3\">Central breast resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a centrally located cancer and associated NAC involvement do not require mastectomy and are candidates for BCS that includes removal of the NAC and the cancer with negative margins of the fibroglandular tissue. The 10-year actuarial survival, distant disease-free survival, and breast recurrence-free survival for central cancers are not significantly different from patients who present with breast cancer elsewhere in the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Central BCS is particularly valuable in women with large breasts where total mastectomy may create prominent asymmetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;, section on 'Selection criteria for BCT'</a>.)</p><p>For a central cancer resection, the incision is made in the pattern of a large parallelogram that encompasses the entire NAC. The skin markings and procedure are illustrated in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57697\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57697 \">picture 4</a>). A variation gaining in popularity is to rotate the incision so that the resulting scar is an inverted T, which can later be utilized in NAC reconstruction and results in a reduction type appearance. </p><p>The remainder of the operation is performed in standard fashion. (See <a href=\"#H284599171\" class=\"local\">'Resection, clip placement, tissue advancement, and closure'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14027116\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduction mastopexy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with large breasts (macromastia), a reduction mastopexy can be used for resection of lesions in the lower hemisphere of the breast, between the four and eight o'clock positions. Breast reduction can help ensure consistent positioning of the breast for radiotherapy, which improves dosing homogeneity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Reduction mastopexy also prevents the downturning of the nipple that can result from traditional BCS using a circumareolar incision. This procedure is more complicated than most other oncoplastic techniques and should be performed in conjunction with a plastic surgeon. A contralateral reduction should be considered to improve postoperative symmetry. The skin markings and procedure are illustrated in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69551\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69551 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A keyhole pattern incision is made, and the skin above the areola is deepithelialized in preparation for skin closure. This creates a pedicle on which the NAC can be advanced and helps preserve the nipple's blood supply. Depending on the location of the cancer and the size of the breast, it is sometimes preferable to use an inferiorly based pedicle for the NAC. For cancers located in the inferolateral or inferomedial quadrants, the keyhole pattern can be rotated slightly to allow for a more lateral or medial excision, while the NAC is moved in a direction opposite to that of the surgical defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. An inframammary incision is made, and breast tissue is dissected off the pectoral fascia to mobilize the NAC and underlying tissues. A full-thickness excision of the lesion with the overlying skin is accomplished, with at least a 1-cm macroscopic margin of normal tissue. Clips should be placed for subsequent radiation planning. (See <a href=\"#H284599171\" class=\"local\">'Resection, clip placement, tissue advancement, and closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Recentralization of the NAC is performed to recreate a harmonious breast size and shape. The medial and lateral breast flaps are undermined and sutured together to fill the excision defect, leaving a typical inverted-T scar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14027123\"><span class=\"h3\">Donut mastopexy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The donut mastopexy technique is best utilized for segmentally distributed cancers located in the upper or lateral breast to achieve resection of long, narrow segments of breast tissue. The donut mastopexy avoids a visible long radial scar, while allowing for adequate margin resection. Only a periareolar scar is visible after this operation. The donut mastopexy lifts the NAC and may create mild asymmetry in comparison to the untreated breast. A contralateral breast lift can be performed to achieve symmetry. The skin markings and procedure are illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78673\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78673 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two concentric incisions are made around the areola and a periareolar &quot;donut&quot; of skin is excised, taking care to avoid full devascularization of the areolar skin. The width of the &quot;donut&quot; skin island should be approximately 1 cm but is somewhat dependent on the size of the areola and expected extent of excision. Removal of this skin is required to allow for both adequate access and exposure to the breast tissue and closure of the skin envelope around the remaining fibroglandular tissue that will reduce tissue volume overall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin flaps are raised circumferentially around the nipple-areolar complex. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The segment of breast tissue with the cancer is resected in a wedge-shaped fashion, dissected from the underlying pectoralis muscle, and delivered through the circumareolar incision. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The remaining breast tissue is advanced, and the peripheral apical corners of the tissue are secured to each other and then anchored to the chest wall. This anchoring, which is generally not required with smaller oncoplastic resection, maintains proper orientation of the mobilized fibroglandular tissue within the skin envelope during the initial phases of healing and is necessary to prevent the unsightly displacement of the breast that would otherwise result from the large amount of dissection performed. Clips are placed for subsequent radiation planning. (See <a href=\"#H284599171\" class=\"local\">'Resection, clip placement, tissue advancement, and closure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A purse-string suture is placed around the areolar opening at a size that reapproximates the original NAC using absorbable suture. Interrupted inverted absorbable sutures are placed subdermally around the NAC, the purse string suture is tied, and absorbable subcuticular sutures are used to close the wound.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595442695\"><span class=\"h2\">Drains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drains are rarely required in most breast-conserving surgeries, as any seroma will generally be reabsorbed. However, with more extensive dissections, such as the donut mastopexy, fluid accumulation is more common and may require postoperative aspiration if the patient is symptomatic. There are no randomized trials examining the use of drains in oncoplastic procedures, but, based on our clinical experience, we place suction drains for one to two days in patients with extensive dissections to diminish excessive fluid accumulation in the dissected breast and avoid distortion of the oncoplastic closure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595442733\"><span class=\"h1\">MARGINS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Negative margins are required to avoid reoperations or local recurrences. In a retrospective series of 272 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with oncoplastic techniques, a positive margin was found in 12 percent of patients, which necessitated a second operation in 33 patients and a third operation in three patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The techniques of intraoperative margin assessment are discussed in another topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;, section on 'Margins of resection'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a positive tumor margin require a reexcision, typically through the same incision. Those with a positive margin involving a small portion of the specimen only need to have that portion of the margin reexcised, instead of the entire biopsy cavity. Indications for reexcision in BCS are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;, section on 'Margins of resection'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with multiple positive margins, a mastectomy may be necessary. In the same series of patients who underwent BCS with oncoplastic techniques, 9 percent of patients ultimately required mastectomy because of positive margins, with 55 percent of the mastectomy specimens revealing residual disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In such patients, it may be technically challenging to incorporate both the initial oncoplastic incision and the nipple-areolar complex into the mastectomy incision. Consultation with a plastic surgeon is recommended, especially if breast reconstruction is planned after mastectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastectomy-indications-types-and-concurrent-axillary-lymph-node-management#H374255001\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastectomy: Indications, types, and concurrent axillary lymph node management&quot;, section on 'Breast reconstruction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595442643\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative complications unique to oncoplastic resections include nipple necrosis, fat necrosis, and delayed healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/2,5,18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,18,24</a>]. They can be minimized by staying in true anatomic planes, maintaining meticulous hemostasis, and avoiding overly aggressive undermining in patients with a fatty breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The complication rates are typically higher in smokers, diabetics, and those who are morbidly obese. </p><p>Other complications that are common to all breast surgeries (eg, wound infection) are discussed elsewhere.

A 2014 meta-analysis found that patients treated with oncoplastic resections had a lower rate of positive margins (12 versus 21 percent) and a lower rate of reexcisions (4 versus 15 percent), but a higher rate of completion mastectomies (7 versus 4 percent) when compared with patients who underwent standard BCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. At three to five years, patients who underwent oncoplastic resections developed fewer complications (16 versus 26 percent) and local recurrences (4 versus 7 percent) and had a higher satisfaction with the appearance of their breast (90 versus 83 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14027158\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and radiation therapy are to provide the survival equivalent of mastectomy, a cosmetically acceptable breast, and a low rate of recurrence in the treated breast.
