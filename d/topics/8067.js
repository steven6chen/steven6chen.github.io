Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation).

It is characterized by macrocytic anemia, a normal or slightly reduced white blood cell count, and a normocellular bone marrow with erythroid hypoplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-children-due-to-decreased-red-blood-cell-production\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in children due to decreased red blood cell production&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1785645\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 to 30 percent of children with DBA recover spontaneously after initial supportive care. The mainstays of therapy of DBA are corticosteroids and blood transfusion. Infants are typically maintained with transfusions until they are 6 to 12 months old, then a trial of corticosteroids is given and has a 60 to 70 percent response rate. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-children-due-to-decreased-red-blood-cell-production#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in children due to decreased red blood cell production&quot;, section on 'Diamond-Blackfan anemia'</a>.)</p><p>Nonresponders usually are dependent on red blood cell transfusions, resulting in transfusional hemosiderosis and requiring chelation therapy to prevent damage to vital organs such as the heart and liver. Prior to the availability of HCT, these patients had a high mortality rate due to iron overload and overwhelming infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1785651\"><span class=\"h2\">Allogeneic transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because HCT has been used to treat aplastic anemia of other bone marrow failure syndromes with success, this approach to treat patients with advanced, unresponsive DBA appeared reasonable. Eligibility for allogeneic HCT varies across countries and institutions. Ultimately, decisions regarding transplant eligibility should be made on a case-by-case basis based on a risk-benefit assessment and the needs and wishes of the patient. Patients should be treated on a clinical protocol, whenever possible. Eligibility for HCT is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167733762\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retrospective studies suggest that allogeneic HCT is effective in the treatment of DBA unresponsive to glucocorticoid therapy. Long-term survival is achieved in 65 to 75 percent of patients.

This group has published the largest series of patients with DBA who underwent HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-diamond-blackfan-anemia-and-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This review included 61 patients with a median age at transplant of seven years (range 1 to 32 years). Forty-one of the patients received transplants from an HLA-identical sibling donor, 8 from a nonsibling family donor, and 12 from an unrelated donor. The median time for transplantation after diagnosis of DBA was 62 months (range 5 to 286 months). Results included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the 59 evaluable patients, 54 achieved neutrophil recovery with a white blood cell count of &gt;500 per mm<sup>3</sup>, (median time: 17 days, range: 10 to 119 days) and 51 achieved platelet recovery, defined as a platelet count &gt;20,000 per mm<sup>3</sup> (median time: 23 days, range: 9 to 119 days). The donor source did not alter the probability of neutrophil recovery. The speed of recovery was greatest in those patients who received the lowest number of transfusions prior to transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cumulative incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 28 percent.

Most of these patients had returned to a normal level of activity with minimal impairment as demonstrated by Karnofsky performance scores of 90 to 100 percent.</p><p/><p>The Diamond Blackfan Anemia Registry of North America is a voluntary database of patients with DBA from the United States and Canada. In a report from 2006, HCT had been performed in 36 patients (median age: 7 years 19 months) primarily because of transfusion dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-diamond-blackfan-anemia-and-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Five years after HCT, the survival rate for patients receiving HCT from an HLA-matched sibling donor was 73 percent, as compared with 19 percent in patients receiving HCT from an alternative donor (umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, or peripheral blood stem cells from a matched unrelated donor, or mismatched bone marrow from a relative). Among the 16 patients who died, causes of death included infection, GVHD, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> veno-occlusive disease of the liver. Graft failure was the cause of death in only one patient, who underwent HCT from an unrelated donor.</p><p>The Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Registry reported the following outcomes of 30 patients with DBA who underwent allogeneic HCT, with the majority performed after the year 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-diamond-blackfan-anemia-and-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A matched sibling donor was employed in 16 patients, with the remaining 14 being transplanted using a matched unrelated donor.

As an example, results from the Italian Association of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology DBA Registry have indicated a significantly worse prognosis for those transplanted after the age of 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-diamond-blackfan-anemia-and-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Transplantation using a similarly affected donor has led to either predictable transplant failure or full donor chimerism with a continued need for transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-diamond-blackfan-anemia-and-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Accordingly, each sibling donor needs to be carefully screened (eg, detection of classical DBA somatic malformations, complete hematologic evaluation, determination of erythrocyte adenosine deaminase levels, and RP molecular analysis). The risk of a silent DBA-affected sibling also has to be considered in the case of familial cord blood storage.

For those transplanted with HLA-identical sibling donors or matched unrelated donors, four-year survival was 52 and 50 percent, respectively. &#160;</p><p/><p>Other studies report similar results of 50 percent survival rate at a median follow-up that ranges from 19 months to 5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-diamond-blackfan-anemia-and-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. In one small study of six patients younger than the age of two years undergoing HCT for MDS, all survived transplantation and were alive more than 1.5 years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-diamond-blackfan-anemia-and-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This suggests an earlier age for HCT prior to complications from MDS may improve the outcome of HCT.</p><p>Secondary MDS, which is an extremely serious complication of cytotoxic chemotherapy, usually is fatal after standard treatment. A report from a single institution described outcomes in pediatric patients with therapy-related secondary MDS or AML, which showed a two-year disease-free survival of 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-diamond-blackfan-anemia-and-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These results are similar to those in adult patients undergoing HCT for treatment-related MDS. Although allogeneic HCT can be curative in this setting, regimen-related toxicity was frequent and recurrent malignancy was a major obstacle.

These complications have surfaced as significant causes of increased mortality, and screening for some of these entities is advised in the hope that early detection may lead to better management. In addition, there are unique aspects of transplant survivorship in pediatric patients including impacts on physical and neuropsychologic growth and development and the psychologic effects of prolonged illness in children. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The approach to hematopoietic cell transplantation survivorship&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare congenital hypoplastic anemia that usually presents early in infancy. The mainstays of therapy are corticosteroids and blood transfusion. Retrospective studies suggest that allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is effective in the treatment of DBA unresponsive to glucocorticoid therapy. Long-term survival is achieved in 65 to 75 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diamond-Blackfan anemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) encompass a spectrum of clonal hematologic disorders, characterized by abnormal proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells, along with ineffective hematopoiesis. Some children develop MDS in the context of an inherited predisposition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97500\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97500 \">table 2</a>). Most transplant centers prefer to proceed to transplant immediately after diagnosis in children with MDS, as the outcome is extremely poor once evolution into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has occurred. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Myelodysplastic syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with DBA or MDS undergoing HCT, an HLA-matched sibling donor is usually preferred; however, a matched unrelated donor is an acceptable alternative when a sibling donor is not available. A partially matched family member donor or umbilical cord blood is a reasonable option for patients who do not have an HLA-identical matched donor. Importantly, when selecting a related donor for patients with an inherited disorder (DBA or familial MDS), one must ensure that the donor does not also carry the same genetic defect as the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1785663\" class=\"local\">'Caveat when using sibling donors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no standard choice of preparative regimen for HCT, and clinical practice varies across countries and institutions. Since most cases are in young patients with minimal comorbidity, myeloablative regimens are commonly used. Studies are ongoing to evaluate reduced intensity regimens for nonmalignant disorders. (See <a href=\"#H167734507\" class=\"local\">'Preparative regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have undergone allogeneic HCT are at risk of developing therapy-related complications that may present years after treatment.
