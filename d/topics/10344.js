It usually ceases within 24 hours. Minor anastomotic bleeding after hand-sewn or stapled anastomoses is common but rarely reported. It is usually manifested by the self-limited passage of dark blood with the patient's first few bowel movements. It is estimated that approximately 50 percent of patients who present initially with minor bleeding will progress to major bleeding and require a blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There are no high-quality data from prospective studies that have addressed this issue.</p><p>It is hypothesized that anastomotic bleeding occurs secondary to inadequate clearance of the mesentery prior to division <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stapling of the bowel.

We suggest the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management should be conservative with supportive care, including blood transfusions and correction of any underlying coagulopathy.

However, the number of patients with anastomotic bleeding in each of these studies is small (6 to 17), thereby limiting an assessment of the true success rate. In a series of 1389 colorectal procedures, for example, seven patients (0.5 percent) developed an anastomotic bleed: six were treated endoscopically to control the bleeding, and one required operative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A potential complication of early postoperative endoscopy is anastomotic dehiscence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some authors advocate water immersion endoscopy for acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the early postoperative period after colorectal anastomoses to limit the risk of colonic leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Endoscopic management of bleeding includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Isotonic saline washout.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electrocoagulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Application of hemostatic clips.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For persistent bleeding from higher colorectal or ileocolic anastomoses, angiographic localization and control using intra-arterial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> has been effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, theoretically, there is a risk of ischemia and anastomotic dehiscence after angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p>Reoperation with resection of the bleeding anastomosis is necessary when endoscopic management is not successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There is no consensus regarding what constitutes a failure of endoscopic management in this setting.

Late leaks often present insidiously with low-grade fever, prolonged ileus, and nonspecific symptoms attributable to other postoperative infectious complications.

A decrease in colonic tissue perfusion proximal to the anastomotic site, at the anastomotic site, and at the rectal stump was reported.

It is likely that male gender has the greatest influence on anastomotic leak rates because operating in the narrower male pelvis is technically more challenging. In contrast, male gender does not appear to be a risk factor for intraperitoneal anastomotic leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anastomotic-complications-of-colorectal-surgery/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity &ndash; Data are conflicting regarding the role of obesity in anastomotic leak complications.

If the fistula persists longer than six weeks or is a high-output fistula, it is less likely to close spontaneously. Definitive operative intervention should be delayed for approximately three to six months to allow for resolution of sepsis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to restore nutritional status. The management of enteric fistulas, including local control and nutritional support, is discussed elsewhere.

Anastomotic complications following colorectal surgery include bleeding, dehiscence and leakage, strictures, and fistulas.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For management of major anastomotic bleeding, the initial management should be conservative with supportive care, including blood transfusions and correction of any underlying coagulopathy. Endoscopic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical intervention should be reserved for unstable patients or those with persistent bleeding despite conservative measures. (See <a href=\"#H800342\" class=\"local\">'Major bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of an extraperitoneal dehiscence includes percutaneous drainage for a low pelvic abscess that is in continuity with anastomotic leak. For patients with a low pelvic abscess in continuity with the anastomotic leak that is not amenable to percutaneous drainage, an examination under anesthesia with transrectal or trans-anastomotic drainage should be performed. Consideration of proximal fecal diversion is warranted in symptomatic patients. (See <a href=\"#H800384\" class=\"local\">'Extraperitoneal anastomotic leak'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Options for management of an intraperitoneal dehiscence include conservative management with broad-spectrum antibiotics and bowel rest, image-guided percutaneous drainage of abscesses, temporary fecal diversion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drainage, or resection of the anastomosis. Early operative intervention is warranted for patients with generalized peritonitis and sepsis or patients with a free intraperitoneal leak on radiographic imaging. (See <a href=\"#H800391\" class=\"local\">'Intraperitoneal anastomotic leak'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management for anastomotic strictures includes finger dilatation for low anastomoses and endoscopic balloon dilatation for higher anastomosis. It is imperative to rule out local recurrence if the initial resection was performed for malignancy. In refractory cases, surgical revision may be required, and, occasionally, permanent fecal diversion is warranted. (See <a href=\"#H800412\" class=\"local\">'Strictures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colocutaneous fistulas can be managed conservatively as most will close without operative intervention. (See <a href=\"#H800454\" class=\"local\">'Fistulas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anastomotic vaginal fistulas should be managed initially by proximal fecal diversion.
