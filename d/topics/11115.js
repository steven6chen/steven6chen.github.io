Specialized testing is needed to identify these duplications. Microduplications are typically one to three megabases (Mb) long and involve several contiguous genes. The exact size and location of a microduplication that causes a syndrome may vary, but a specific &quot;critical region&quot; may be consistently involved. Most of the phenotypic effects of these microduplications are due to changes in a few critical dose-sensitive genes or, in some cases, a single gene if a duplication disrupts its integrity.</p><p>The phenotype of microduplication syndromes is often less clear and less well defined than for the corresponding microdeletion syndrome. In addition, some microduplication syndromes may be inherited from apparently normal parents, raising important issues regarding incomplete penetrance and ascertainment bias in these newly described clinical entities.</p><p>This topic reviews microduplication syndromes of chromosomes 1 to 22. Microdeletion syndromes, congenital abnormalities of the sex chromosomes, and other congenital chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomies, are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

The most common and better delineated genomic disorders are divided in two main categories: those resulting from copy number losses (deletion syndromes) and those resulting from copy number gains (duplication syndromes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Copy number variations (CNVs) are submicroscopic genomic differences in the number of copies of one or more sections of DNA that result in DNA gains or losses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67644\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67644 \">figure 1</a>). Some CNVs are pathogenic and cause syndromic disorders with consistent phenotypic features, as are discussed here. Other CNVs are associated with disease susceptibility or resistance, and the same CNV can be associated with several diverse disorders. Still, other CNVs are part of normal genetic variation and have no recognized disease association. Contiguous gene syndromes can occur when CNVs affect several adjacent genes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;, section on 'Copy number variations (CNVs)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-genetic-disease#H1031916\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of genetic disease&quot;, section on 'Copy number variation'</a>.)</p><p>The main mechanism that leads to disease in genomic disorders secondary to deletions and duplications is a change in the copy number of a dose-sensitive gene or genes. Other disease mechanisms include interference with imprinted genes and with regulatory elements outside genes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview#H16722227\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;, section on 'Disease mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p>Genomic disorders are typically detected by array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58888\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58888 \">figure 2</a>). Most laboratories confirm gains or losses detected on an array with an independent method, such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR).

Psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia in adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microduplication-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have also been reported. Other developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, have been reported in up to 41 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microduplication-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Autism is most commonly observed in patients with duplications rather than deletions of this region. Abnormalities in brain imaging, including periventricular heterotopia, dilated ventricles, reduced corpus callosum, and Chiari I malformation, were observed in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microduplication-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The clinical presentation of this disorder is variable due to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. Thus, this microduplication is also seen in asymptomatic individuals. <em>HYDIN2 </em>(hydrocephalus-inducing, mouse, homolog of) is the gene implicated in this disorder.

Clinical findings include microcephaly; low-set, simple ears; downturned corners of the mouth; long, bushy eyebrows; long eyelashes; high nasal bridge; eye abnormalities (microphthalmia, cataracts, irides colobomas); cleft palate; and renal and cardiac anomalies (MIM #611936) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microduplication-syndromes/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Mild to moderate intellectual disabilities are common, and patients may have speech delay. However, this duplication has been seen in apparently unaffected individuals.

Patients with duplications involving <em>NSD1</em> present with microcephaly, global developmental delay, short stature, growth retardation, and delayed bone age. Dysmorphic features have been reported, as well as behavioral, ocular, and mild hand anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microduplication-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The reciprocal duplication causes a different clinical phenotype characterized by hypotonia and global developmental delay, with speech delay that can range from moderate to severe. Many of these patients have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microduplication-syndromes/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Other findings were demonstrated in one clinical series, including joint hyperextensibility and tendency to fracture with minimal trauma. In addition, this study showed some improvements of reciprocal social behaviors over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microduplication-syndromes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The gene(s) responsible for the phenotype are not yet known.

Renal and genitourinary anomalies, such as renal and gonadal agenesis, are also seen in this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microduplication-syndromes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Hearing evaluations are recommended to rule out other causes of speech delay. Other screening studies include speech evaluation, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electroencephalogram (EEG). Renal ultrasound is recommended to rule out structural genitourinary anomalies. Echocardiograms are warranted at the time of diagnosis and thereafter every two to three years to rule out dilatation that could be addressed by medical or surgical treatment.
