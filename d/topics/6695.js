Hemodialysis AV access causes an acute decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a secondary increase in cardiac output.

In response to increases in blood flow and shear stress, the vascular endothelium releases nitric oxide and other endothelium-dependent relaxing factors that dilate the artery, reducing shear stress towards normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. One study showed that mean shear stress increased by 475 percent and brachial artery diameter by 15 percent within one day following placement of a radio-cephalic AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The decrease in systemic vascular resistance causes an acute fall in both central and peripheral blood pressure. In response, there is an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity (which increases contractility and heart rate). It is this combination of decreased cardiac afterload and increased sympathetic activation that causes increases in cardiac output acutely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/6,17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17,20</a>].</p><p>The cardiac output increases immediately upon opening of the AV fistula and continues to increase over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/6,14,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,21,22</a>]. This increase in cardiac output leads to an increase in venous return to the right side of the heart, leading to right ventricular dilatation in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Conversely, acute compression of an AV fistula increases systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure and decreases cardiac output. The increase in pressure leads to baroreflex-mediated reduction in heart rate (Branham's sign).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4251361280\"><span class=\"h2\">Subacute and chronic changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subacute changes occur within days after creation of the AV access. Within two weeks of AV fistula creation, blood volume increases, leading to greater venous return and increased right atrial, pulmonary artery, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Both plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations increase after AV fistula creation, peaking 10 days after AV fistula creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The cardiac output continues to increase over days and weeks after opening of an AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/6,14,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,21,22</a>]. In one study of 16 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, the cardiac output as assessed by echocardiography increased by 10 percent at 3 days and 14 percent by 14 days after AV fistula placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In another study of 30 patients, the cardiac output increased by 17 percent two weeks after successful AV fistula surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The increase in cardiac output is generally proportional to AV access blood flow, although the relationship is complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>]. AV access flow is significantly lower for radiocephalic AV fistula as compared with brachial artery-based AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The AV fistula blood flow increases the first day after creation of the fistula and continues to increase. In one study in which access blood flow was calculated just before the creation of an AV fistula and at days 1, 7, 28, and six months after construction, the most dramatic change occurred at day 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. By day 28, blood flow had doubled. A further 38.5 percent increase was noted at the last measurement performed after six months.</p><p>The increases in cardiac output over days and weeks after creation of an AV fistula may be one of many factors contributing to the observation that the highest mortality rate for incident hemodialysis patients occurs within the first 120 days after starting hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Chronic changes occurring over weeks and months in response to the AV fistula may include the development or worsening of right ventricular dilation and dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left atrial dilatation, and pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Myocardial remodeling related to volume overload occurs within the first few weeks after AV fistula creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/24,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,29,30</a>]. In some cases, left ventricle hypertrophy progresses despite improvements in fluid management and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. However, more recent data suggest that left ventricular chamber size decreases chronically after AV fistula, in contrast with the right ventricle, which dilates and may become dysfunctional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>AV access-mediated increases in cardiac output can also increase the risk of pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].

Such patients may show progressive symptoms including dyspnea at rest or with exertion, orthopnea, and fatigue that do not improve with aggressive diuresis or ultrafiltration (if on dialysis) to optimal dry weight or anemia correction. This may occur any time following creation of AV access, from weeks to even years later. It may be more difficult to achieve dry weight on hemodialysis because of intradialytic hemodynamic instability.

All patients who undergo access placement have markedly reduced kidney function and are at risk for heart failure. Patients who are at particular risk to develop heart failure related to the AV access include those with a large, distended fistula, especially in the upper-arm position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/1,2,4,6,28,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,6,28,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1703588965\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring strategy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal frequency of evaluation is not known.

This allows for definitive assessment of volume status, direct determination of cardiac output and pulmonary artery pressures, and examination of the hemodynamic response to transient fistula occlusion. Transient fistula occlusion (30 seconds) can provide valuable data when considering management strategies. Transient fistula occlusion should produce a reduction in cardiac output that is often coupled with reduction in central venous pressure. Pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures may not decrease during transient fistula occlusion, due to the acute increase in cardiac afterload.

These classifications relate to patient prognosis and the risk associated with AV fistula (AVF) creation. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with NYHA functional class IV have the highest risk of clinical aggravation and fatal outcome after AVF creation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/25,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,35</a>]. </p><p>Heart failure patients may benefit more from peritoneal dialysis (PD) than hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-49</a>]. PD avoids the risks associated with AVF creation and allows better control of volume status because of daily ultrafiltration. However, many variables factor into the decision for PD, including the patient's ability and willingness to perform the procedure. Although we believe all patients with heart failure should be evaluated and even recommended for PD, dialysis modality selection is based upon many factors. In practice, patients with heart failure are often unable to perform PD and lack the required support at home, so they default to in-center HD.</p><p>For patients with HF who are treated with HD, the following approach to vascular access selection in ESRD patients with heart failure is suggested:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> stage C heart failure with NYHA functional class I or II: Radial-cephalic AV fistula</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> stage C with NYHA functional class III or IV or stage D: Tunneled dialysis catheter </p><p/><p>For patients with advanced heart failure, a tunneled central catheter insertion rather than an AVF is reasonable given the limited life expectancy for patients with higher stages of heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The best approach is to create a radial-cephalic AV fistula with sufficient blood flow to perform the hemodialysis treatment and, at the same time, with a minimum of hemodynamic impact. In addition, it has been suggested that a side-to-end anastomosis be used when creating a radial-cephalic AV fistula. This has been reported to result in a lower flow than a side-to-side anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The goal of surgery is to reduce fistula blood flow while maintaining sufficient flow for adequate dialysis.

Adequacy of access flow restriction was evaluated intraoperatively using ultrasound flow measurements, adjusting the banding diameter in 0.5 mm increments to achieve the targeted AV fistula flow. Mean access flow was reduced to a mean of 598 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (481 to 876) after banding. The clinical signs of heart failure disappeared, and AV fistulas remained patent in all patients. Two patients had renal transplant failure and later successfully used the AV fistula. Follow-up postbanding was 1 to 18 months (mean = 12). In another study including 35 patients, fistula banding was associated with reductions in LV size and pulmonary artery pressure as estimated by echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While there was no reduction in right ventricular size in this study, there was no further progression in remodeling associated with banding. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In another study, 17 hemodialysis patients with an upper-arm vascular access and heart failure were treated by ligating the brachial artery anastomosis and reconstructing the access using an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene vascular graft in a bypass from the radial artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The mean access inflow rate and the mean cardiac output decreased after the inflow reduction procedure, with resolution of symptoms. The median length of follow-up in the series was 16 months. During the follow-up period, thrombosis or stenosis developed in seven patients, three of whom underwent surgical revision. Thirteen of the 17 accesses (77 percent) subjected to the inflow reduction procedure remained patent. Access loss was due to failed fistuloplasty or thrombosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a six-month prospective, observational study of 25 consecutive hemodialysis patients, there was a decrease in both eccentric and concentric hypertrophy after closure of an AV fistula and placement of a tunneled catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The left ventricular ejection fraction also increased in this study. Improvement in cardiac function (and presumably heart failure severity) may be greater in patients with higher cardiac output prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-heart-failure-caused-by-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].
