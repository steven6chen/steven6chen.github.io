Other treatment sites (nasopharyngeal cancer) are typically treated with a nonsurgical radiation-based approach. For patients with early stage disease (T1-2N0), radiation monotherapy is a standard alternative to surgery as a curative modality. In the locally advanced setting (T3-4, N+), intensified RT or concurrent chemoradiotherapy is frequently used as a nonsurgical, organ-preserving alternative to resection.</p><p>In both earlier and more-advanced stages of disease, there are unique considerations regarding optimal radiation dosing, fractionation schedules, and timing of therapy for patients managed nonoperatively with definitive RT. These issues are reviewed here. </p><p>The principles of RT as applied to patients with head and neck cancer are presented separately.

Increased daily doses can range from 2.2 Gy per fraction all the way up to 8.5 Gy per fraction in the case of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of the head and neck. While SBRT is typically used in the reirradiation setting, studies are emerging that will evaluate its role in the upfront setting, either for early stage larynx cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] or for patients who are too old or frail for a conventional protracted course of RT for more-advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2044093836\" class=\"local\">'Hypofractionation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer#H24952346\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reirradiation for locally recurrent head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'SBRT'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hypofractionation has most commonly been explored in earlier-stage disease as a means of reducing the length of the treatment course and intensifying the biologic effectiveness of radiation. Although increasing the dose per fraction typically causes concern about an increased risk of late effects, the relatively smaller volumes of radiation in early stage disease and the lack of concurrent chemotherapy use have mitigated those concerns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperfractionation with dose escalation &ndash; Hyperfractionation utilizes multiple daily treatments with smaller-than-conventional fraction sizes given over approximately the same treatment duration. Typical hyperfractionation schedules use 1.1 to 1.2 Gy per fraction, two fractions per day (with an interval of six hours or more between fractions), to total doses of 74 to 82 Gy. This regimen exploits the differential radiation sensitivity of tumors and late-reacting normal tissues, and allows for the delivery of a higher tumor dose without increasing the risk of severe long-term complications beyond those associated with standard fractionation. (See <a href=\"#H99325300\" class=\"local\">'Hyperfractionation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerated fractionation with or without dose reduction &ndash; Accelerated fractionation administers the same or a slightly reduced total dose to tumor but over a shorter treatment course by giving multiple smaller doses (1.5 to 1.6 Gy) per day or giving additional standard-size doses (2 Gy) per week (eg, six or seven fractions versus five fractions per week). This approach attempts to reduce tumor repopulation during the course of RT, which is a known cause of RT failure. An older technique commonly used in the pre-intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) era was called &quot;concomitant boost,&quot; in which 54 Gy was delivered in 30 fractions of 1.8 Gy once daily and a boost was given by a second RT plan directed to the gross disease only to a dose of 18 Gy in 12 fractions given as a second daily fraction. This technique is not commonly used in the IMRT era.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A more commonly used accelerated fractionation approach with IMRT is that of the Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA), in which 70 Gy is delivered in 35 fractions, six fractions over five days per week over six weeks, using a single RT plan. A second plan in which a boost volume to sites of gross disease constitutes the sixth fraction can also be used. (see <a href=\"#H1493367204\" class=\"local\">'Accelerated fractionation RT'</a> below). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H576024224\"><span class=\"h2\">Early versus advanced stage disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypofractionation has been studied primarily in early stage disease (eg, stage I to II) due to smaller treatment volumes and the lack of chemotherapy use. For patients with locally advanced disease (eg, stage III to IV), typical strategies of radiation intensification include hyperfractionation with dose escalation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> accelerated fractionation with or without dose modification. For locally advanced disease, the use of altered fractionation in the setting of RT alone significantly improves treatment outcomes; however, when RT is combined with chemotherapy, the survival benefit from altered fractionation is no longer present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044093836\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOFRACTIONATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypofractionation attempts to improve tumor control by increasing the biological effectiveness of the treatment by using higher daily doses of radiation. Because increasing the dose per fraction has been associated with increasing risks of late effects, this has primarily been used in earlier-stage disease, where the treatment volume is relatively smaller and concurrent chemotherapy is not used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135695411\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical trial results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypofractionation has been best studied in the setting of early larynx cancer.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized Japanese trial compared the use of 2.25 Gy per fraction with the standard 2 Gy per fraction regimen in stage I glottis cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Total dose was dependent on bulk; if less than or equal to two-thirds of a vocal cord was involved with cancer, then the standard dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions was compared with 56.25 Gy in 25 fractions. Bulkier tumors were randomized between 66 Gy in 33 fractions and 63 Gy in 28 fractions. Overall, hypofractionation significantly improved local control rates compared with standard fractionation (92 versus 77 percent), without any impact on cause-specific survival. No significant differences were found in terms of rates of acute mucosal reaction, skin reactions, or chronic adverse reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized Korean trial in 156 patients included both stage I and II patients and compared standard fractionation with hypofractionation plus dose escalation. Stage I patients were randomized between 60 Gy in 30 fractions (2 Gy per fraction) and 63 Gy in 28 fractions (2.25 Gy per fraction), while stage II patients were randomized between 66 Gy in 33 fractions (2 Gy per fraction) and 67.5 Gy in 30 fractions (2.25 Gy per fraction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The trial did not complete enrollment and was stopped early. Overall, there was no significant difference in the five-year larynx progression-free survival, which nominally favored the hypofractionation arms (77.8 versus 88.5 percent; p = 0.2). There was no increase in adverse effects, and the authors advocated the hypofractionated approach for its convenience and potential benefit. </p><p/><p>This approach has become a standard for patients with early larynx cancer, with 63 Gy in 28 fractions commonly used for stage T1 cancers and 65.25 Gy in 29 fractions used for T2 cancers with mobile vocal cords [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend either conventionally fractionated RT (2&thinsp;Gy per fraction to 66 to 70&thinsp;Gy) or hypofractionated RT (2.25&thinsp;Gy per fraction to 63 to 65.25&thinsp;Gy) for early stage, node-negative (T1-2, N0) glottic cancer.</p><p>Another commonly used hypofractionated regimen for radiation alone in earlier-stage oropharyngeal cancer is 66 Gy in 30 fractions (2.2 Gy per fraction), which was tested in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0022 trial in T1-2N0-1 oropharyngeal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A National Cancer Database (NCDB) study of over 10,000 patients with T1-2N0 larynx cancer treated with radiation therapy (RT) between 2004 and 2013 revealed that hypofractionated regimens were associated with improved overall survival (77.1 versus 73.5 percent; p&lt;0.001). The survival difference is somewhat unexpected given the high rates of surgical salvage for these patients, and it may reflect unrecognized selection biases that cannot be further interrogated due to the lack of disease-specific outcomes data in the NCDB. Only 40 percent of patients were treated with hypofractionated regimens, but 60 percent were treated with hypofractionation in the final year of the study, indicating an increasing frequency of its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Patients with less-favorable subsets of stage II larynx cancer (ie, impaired cord mobility) do relatively poorly despite dose-escalated hypofractionated RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Concurrent chemotherapy is frequently considered for these patients as a means of enhancing larynx preservation, similar to those with T3 cancers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99325300\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERFRACTIONATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperfractionation attempts to improve tumor control by increasing the total dose of radiation. Long-term toxicity to normal tissues depends in part upon the size of each treatment fraction, as well as the total radiation dose. Decreasing the size of each radiation fraction should permit higher total doses without increasing late morbidity compared with conventionally fractionated irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1493366898\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical trial results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperfractionation is now favored over concomitant boost as the intensified radiation therapy (RT) regimen of choice to exploit the tumor control benefits without significantly increasing late effects.

An initial report at median follow-up of 23 months showed significant improvement in tumor control and a trend toward improvement in disease-free survival in the patients treated with hyperfractionation and AFX-C (groups 2 and 4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Final results of this trial were published in 2014 with a median follow-up of 14 years for surviving patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Locoregional failure occurred in 568 patients, 553 (97 percent) within the first five years. Overall, there were no significant differences in locoregional control or overall survival between the arms in long-term follow-up. There was a 19 percent reduction in locoregional failure for both the hyperfractionation and AFX-C arms relative to standard fractionation (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, p = 0.08 for both), and the hyperfractionation arm had significantly improved locoregional control for those patients censored at five years (HR 0.79, p = 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of distant metastases or second malignancies. </p><p>Although hyperfractionation schedules result in improved locoregional disease control, this technique may be associated with an increase in late side effects. In the final report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], the one-year feeding tube dependency rates for disease-free patients were significantly higher for all three experimental arms (hyperfractionation = 17.3 percent; AFX-S = 12 percent; AFX-C = 13.4 percent) compared with the standard fractionation arm (4.6 percent). However, there appeared to be continued recovery in these patients, leaving no statistically significant differences in these groups at five years post-therapy (standard fractionation = 8.3 percent; hyperfractionation = 4.8 percent; AFX-S = 4.8 percent; AFX-C = 13 percent). There were also no statistically significant differences in the incidence of grade 3 to 5 toxicity at five years between the arms.

Altered fractionation was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival, with an absolute benefit of 3.1 percent at five years (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.98). The overall survival benefit associated with altered fractionation was limited to hyperfractionation (8.1 and 3.9 percent, respectively, at 5 and 10 years).</p><p>In subset analysis, the benefit from hyperfractionation decreased when age increased, but it was consistent across other subgroups.

While the data from Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9003 and the Meta-analysis of Radiotherapy in Carcinomas of the Head and Neck (MARCH) favor hyperfractionation as the approach of choice for intensified radiation therapy, hyperfractionation is certainly the most costly, resource- and time-intensive, and inconvenient regimen. As such, accelerated fractionation schemes such as six fractions weekly have gained favor in recent years as they are less costly and more convenient for patients. If hyperfractionation is not feasible for a particular patient, this accelerated fractionation regimen may be preferable to the concomitant-boost approach as the latter has been associated with increasing late effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18236634\"><span class=\"h1\">SIMULTANEOUS INTEGRATED BOOST TECHNIQUE WITH IMRT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the advent of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and its widespread adoption in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer, the ability to focally increase the dose per fraction to the tumor itself while maintaining lower doses to elective areas of interest has gained in popularity as a novel means of radiation therapy (RT) intensification. This has been studied most closely in the nasopharyngeal cancer setting, where the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0225 and 0615 trials used a regimen of 70 Gy in 33 fractions using 2.12 Gy per fraction. More recent results of this approach reveal excellent locoregional control and favorable toxicity profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Several institutions use this regimen as a standard, with or without chemotherapy.

In patients with early larynx cancers, hypofractionated regimens (eg, using 2.2 to 2.25 Gy per fraction) have been shown to be safe and effective and appear to offer superior local control and enhanced convenience compared with conventionally (eg, 2 Gy per fraction) fractionated regimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In locally advanced (eg, stage III to IV) disease, radiation, usually administered with concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy, is the treatment of choice for patients with potentially resectable locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer who desire nonsurgical organ preservation and for those who have surgically unresectable disease. In the setting of concurrent chemotherapy, once-a-day fractionated RT is standard. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> disease who can be appropriately managed with RT alone. These include patients with a contraindication to platinum-based chemotherapy, those who refuse chemotherapy, and those who may have a small absolute benefit from the addition of concurrent systemic therapy (eg, patients &gt;70 years old or those with T1-2, N1-2a disease, especially those that are p16 positive) and may be at relatively higher risk of chemotherapy-related complications (eg, older age, poor social support, noncompliance). (See <a href=\"#H1742244583\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection for definitive radiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative benefits of hyperfractionation and accelerated fractionation need to be balanced against the increased cost and inconvenience with which these approaches are associated. For patients who are treated with RT alone, we suggest either a hyperfractionated schedule or an accelerated schedule (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). These approaches improve locoregional control and overall survival compared with standard fractionation. The optimal hyperfractionated schedule is uncertain; our approach is to use a dose of 74.4 to 81.6 Gy with 1.2 Gy per fraction with an interval of six hours or more between fractions. (See <a href=\"#H99325300\" class=\"local\">'Hyperfractionation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients for whom hyperfractionation is not logistically feasible appear to benefit from accelerated RT strategies, such as six fractions weekly, as an alternative method of intensifying RT efficacy without significantly increasing the risk of late toxicity. While the survival advantages seen in some trials may not be evident in the Meta-analysis of Radiotherapy in Carcinomas of the Head and Neck (MARCH) meta-analysis, improved locoregional control is an important endpoint in these patients that justifiably influences the choice of RT regimen. However, accelerated regimens using split courses of RT or reduced total doses do not improve locoregional tumor control or overall survival. (See <a href=\"#H1493367204\" class=\"local\">'Accelerated fractionation RT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hyperfractionation and standard-dose continuous-course accelerated RT increase the incidence of clinically significant acute effects, including mucositis, edema, and pain. While late effects can also be higher with these regimens, these differences abate over time and appear comparable to those with conventional RT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A conventional treatment regimen using a total dose of 70 Gy over seven weeks, given as a single fraction (2 Gy) once daily, five days per week, with 50 to 60 Gy targeting of elective areas, is a reasonable alternative to hyperfractionation or an accelerated treatment approach. (See <a href=\"#H1742244619\" class=\"local\">'Paradigms of dose and fractionation modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newer treatment technologies (intensity-modulated RT and image-guided RT) can improve sparing of normal tissues and, thus, increase the daily tumor dose without an increase in normal tissue toxicity. Using these techniques, many RT centers have increased their daily dose range to 2.1 to 2.2 Gy per day.
