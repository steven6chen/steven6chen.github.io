Medical thoracoscopy is most commonly used for pleural fluid drainage, pleural biopsy, and pleurodesis. Although the equipment and some applications are similar to those used in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), it is typically more limited in its diagnostic and therapeutic functions and performed by pulmonologists, thus the term &quot;medical&quot; thoracoscopy. </p><p>The technique, instruments used, and complications of medical thoracoscopy are reviewed here. The diagnostic and therapeutic uses are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy): Diagnostic and therapeutic applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INSTRUMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rigid and semirigid thoracoscopes are commonly used; choosing among them is typically operator-dependent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rigid instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rigid thoracoscope is probably still the most common instrument used for medical thoracoscopy. It is cheap and provides both excellent optical quality and maneuverability within the pleural space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Multiple diameter and angle-viewing instruments are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most instruments contain a light source, working channel, and video port all in a single device, allowing for a single point of entry procedure. Other instruments fulfill just one of these needs which necessitates a multi-port procedure. (See <a href=\"#H2912337702\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a point of entry'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some thoracoscopes are 0-degree telescopes used for direct viewing while oblique 30- and 50-degree, and 90-degree telescopes offer a panoramic view of the pleural cavity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An array of accessories for probes for palpation, needles for aspiration biopsy, and forceps for electrocautery or biopsy are available. </p><p/><p>Rigid scopes are generally placed through cannulas into the thoracic cavity. A trocar is a solid blunt device placed inside a cannula and both the trocar and cannula are placed together into the chest cavity; the trocar is then removed and the scope placed through the cannula. Multiple diameter <span class=\"nowrap\">cannulas/trocars</span> (3 to 10 mm) are available to accommodate thoracoscopes of varying sizes. While larger instruments may offer improved views of the pleural cavity, there is concern that they may compress the intercostal nerve and cause discomfort during the procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621818031\"><span class=\"h2\">Semi-rigid instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Semi-rigid (&quot;flexi-rigid&quot;) fiberoptic video-pleuroscopes are being increasingly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. Similar to a rigid bronchoscope, the proximal portion (handle and shaft) is stiff, while similar to a flexible bronchoscope, the distal end is smaller in diameter and flexible so that the tip can be flexed or extended two-dimensionally. The handle, suction, and a working channel can, similar to a flexible bronchoscope, accommodate accessories such as a biopsy forceps. In addition, the semi-rigid endoscope is compatible with flexible bronchoscopic light sources and video processors, thereby, allowing this instrument to be readily adapted for use in the endoscopy suite.</p><p>In general, comparable diagnostic results and safety profiles have been reported between rigid and semi-rigid thoracoscopy, but similar to flexible equipment, adhesions or loculations may impact negatively on the success of semi-rigid thoracoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79264840\"><span class=\"h2\">Others</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1380286122\"><span class=\"h3\">Flexible fiberoptic instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flexible bronchoscopes are rarely used since they are difficult to manipulate within the pleural cavity, are subject to equipment damage from the manipulation and from adhesions, and have been supplanted by the semirigid scope which offers biopsies of similar size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Areas of malignancy appear a different color changing from white or pink (under white light) to red using a fluorescent light. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescence-bronchoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fluorescence bronchoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3053028637\"><span class=\"h3\">Three dimensional instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pleuroscopes provide two-dimensional views of the thoracic cavity. Newer pleuroscopes that have three dimensional imaging capacity are available but are not widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1721864078\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical thoracoscopy should only be performed by properly trained personnel, usually an interventional pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon. Since most cases are performed using local anesthesia and procedural sedation, medical thoracoscopy is generally performed in an endoscopy suite and less commonly in the operating room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. More complex cases are performed under general anesthesia in the operating room. Pleuroscopy is performed using standard surgical sterile technique and drapes, gowns, and gloves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2912337702\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing a point of entry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is placed in the lateral position with the affected side up. A point of entry is then generally chosen using ultrasound, although the history and examination and prior chest imaging (typically computed tomography) also facilitate the selection of the appropriate entry site. In the past, when a pneumothorax was induced prior to sedation, a chest radiograph was taken before thoracoscopy to decide the most appropriate interspace through which the thoracoscope should be introduced. However, this practice has waned since the introduction of ultrasonography which can readily detect fluid and septae within the pleural cavity at the time of the procedure. Ultrasound-guided selection of the entry point into the pleural cavity may optimize the chance for success by avoiding adhesions and may reduce trocar access failures and pneumothorax rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Identifying fluid by ultrasound is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thoracentesis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis&quot;, section on 'Technique'</a>.)</p><p>When choosing a point of entry the following should also be taken in to consideration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/18,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21-23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pleural inspection, the mid-axillary line of the 4th or 5th intercostal space is preferred since it allows optimal inspection of the pleura. Care should be taken to avoid the lateral thoracic artery (high in the axilla).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For lesions that have a predilection to the lower regions or diaphragm (eg. metastatic tumor or mesothelioma) these lesions may be more easily accessed through the lower intercostal spaces. However, care should be taken to avoid puncturing the diaphragm.</p><p/><p>The clinician should decide in advance whether a single point or two points of entry will be needed. Although the single puncture technique is the most commonly employed method of diagnostic thoracoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/4,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24-27</a>], some physicians use a double puncture method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/1,2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,28</a>]. With this latter technique, either prior to or during the procedure, the second site of entry is made under direct video guidance (ie, with the telescope inside the pleural cavity) to simplify visualization or sampling of difficult to reach areas such as the costovertebral angle, mediastinal pleural surfaces, and the lung apex. Two punctures may also be necessary for more complex procedures to facilitate adhesiolysis, drainage of complex fluid collections, sampling of lesions close to the first entry site, or for accessing difficult to reach posterior or mediastinal regions, although the flexi-rigid scope may be optimal for the latter. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H815838631\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases are performed using local anesthesia and procedural sedation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2442873634\"><span class=\"h3\">Local anesthesia plus procedural sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a point(s) of entry is chosen, patients are sterilely draped and the skin can be anesthetized (unless the patient is having a general anesthetic) at the point of entry. Following local anesthesia, sedation is administered. &#160;</p><p>Thoracoscopic procedures typically performed under local anesthesia are inspection of the pleural space, removal of pleural fluid, biopsy of parietal pleura, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a>. Having back up services of thoracic surgery available is appropriate should the need for surgery or general anesthesia for unanticipated complications arise.</p><p>Following cleaning of the skin with sterile antiseptic, 1 or 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> is infiltrated into the skin, soft tissue, intercostal muscles, and periosteum of the rib, similar to that described for thoracentesis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thoracentesis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis&quot;, section on 'Site preparation and local anesthesia'</a>). Some experts provide additional topical anesthesia (via a second <span class=\"nowrap\">cannula/trocar</span> or through the working channel of the scope) to the pleura when planning pleurodesis (eg, 1 or 2 percent lidocaine via spray catheter; maximum 3 mg per kg) just prior to sclerosant administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>For procedural sedation, we use a combination of intravenous narcotic, commonly either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, plus a benzodiazepine, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, for analgesia, sedation, and amnesia. Occasionally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> is used instead of a benzodiazepine, requiring the presence of an anesthesiologist or a nurse anesthetist. Typical dosing is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2203047846\"><span class=\"h3\">General anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General anesthesia is typically reserved for more complex or high risk medical thoracoscopic procedures (eg, lung biopsy or sympathectomy), or it is anticipated that significant deflation of the lung or conversion to video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is likely (eg, complicated pleural space, lobectomy). There is no need for local anesthesia if general anesthesia is being used. &#160;</p><p>Thoracoscopy under general anesthesia can be performed with or without selective bronchial intubation for the ventilation of one lung. Single lung ventilation is preferable when video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is performed, because selective contralateral lung ventilation permits complete ipsilateral lung deflation, although techniques for nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery (NITS) are also feasible and described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for pulmonary resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Intercostal dissection and lung deflation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the patient is adequately positioned, sedated, monitored (vital signs, oxygen level), sterilely draped and local anesthetic applied to the point of entry, intercostal dissection occurs as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A wet pleural space &ndash; Since in most patients, pleuroscopy is being done for pleural fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">drainage/biopsy,</span> the lung can be deflated by accessing the pleural space and allowing deflation to occur with spontaneous respiration. A 10 mm incision is made above the superior rib margin parallel with the rib. Simple dissection is then performed with a hemostat through the subcutaneous tissue to the intercostal muscles. Some experts reinject the parietal pleura at the level of the intercostal muscles with local anesthetic at this point. The hemostat is used to bluntly enter the pleural space by placing pressure on the hemostat and slowly moving through the intercostal space until it &quot;pops through&quot; the intercostal muscle-parietal pleura complex. Fluid will automatically emerge. A probing finger may be placed into the pleural space to check for adhesions. Air enters the chest cavity with inspiration. The lung will deflate slightly using this method. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dry pleural space &ndash; If a dry pleural space is suspected or known, some experts use the same approach while occasionally, others will induce a pneumothorax before intercostal dissection, to limit the risk of lung puncture. This can be done using a Boutin needle or an angiocatheter, which can be used to&nbsp;access the pleural space and drain pleural fluid (if present); a pneumothorax is induced&nbsp;by leaving the <span class=\"nowrap\">needle/angiocatheter</span> open to air&nbsp;(air enters the pleural space naturally during respiration). Once a pneumothorax is induced, the intercostal space can be dissection as described in the above bullet. In the past, clinicians used to check for a pneumothorax using a chest radiograph after pneumothorax induction, but this is no longer done since the introduction of bedside ultrasonography.</p><p/><p>The blunt-tip trocar and cannula together are then introduced into the pleural space, taking care to avoid lung injury. The trocar is removed and the thoracoscope is passed through the cannula (passage through the cannula ensures that no tissue residue covers the camera) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/1,2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,28</a>]. </p><p>During the procedure if the distance between the lung and the chest wall is small and felt to be impairing visualization of the pleura, additional air can be cautiously introduced to collapse the lung further and enlarge the pleural space. When using a rigid scope, the cannula has a sealed sideport which can be transiently opened to introduce air. Care must be taken to avoid iatrogenic tension pneumothorax when insufflating air into the pleural cavity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2638827570\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inspection of the pleural cavity is accomplished by maneuvering the telescope in a methodical manner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F114096\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114096 \">movie 1</a>). The cannula is held in place at the skin surface to avoid crushing soft tissue, ribs, and nerves. The scope is slowly maneuvered from apex to diaphragm and medially towards the hilum so that the entire pleural surface is examined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F114096\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef114096 \">movie 1</a>). </p><p>Other interventional instruments such as a probe, a needle for aspiration, or a biopsy forceps may be introduced through the working channel or via another entry site, the choice of which depends upon the operator and thoracoscope used. Procedures commonly performed include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural fluid removal &ndash; Fluid may be removed via a suction port on the thoracoscope. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhesiolysis &ndash; Adhesions, which may interfere with complete examination of the pleural cavity, can be lysed with either a blunt probe or cautery forceps or the thoracoscope, with caution to avoid vascularized adhesions and tearing of visceral pleura or lung. If cautery is available, then vascular adhesions may be cauterized before lysing. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parietal pleural biopsy &ndash; Biopsies of suspicious areas are obtained under direct visualization. The forceps is used to probe the rib avoiding the neurovascular bundle on the inferior aspect. The forceps are opened, abnormal tissue grasped and forceps closed. The forceps should be withdrawn in a &quot;stripping&quot; or &quot;tearing&quot; motion rather than a grab and pull motion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F115102\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef115102 \">movie 2</a>); this can be achieved by slightly angulating the scope after the tissue has been grasped and then withdrawing the forceps (like peeling dead skin) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F115103\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef115103 \">movie 3</a>). Other methods include using an insulated tip diathermic knife (via a semi-rigid thoracoscope) and cryobiopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoscopic-cryotechniques-in-adults#H4055375\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoscopic cryotechniques in adults&quot;, section on 'Cryobiopsy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemical pleurodesis &ndash; Various delivery devices for sclerosant are available such as spray atomizer, bulb syringe, or spray catheters that can be administered via the working channel, through the cannula, or through a second port if a multi-port technique is used; some experts use a second port so that the delivery of sclerosant can be directly visualized by the pleuroscope. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemical-pleurodesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemical pleurodesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-pleurodesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Talc pleurodesis&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>Other procedures that are less frequently performed include visceral pleural and lung biopsy, blebectomy, and sympathectomy. These procedures are highly specialized, generally carry increased risk, and are unlikely to be performed in the endoscopy suite. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical thoracoscopy (pleuroscopy): Diagnostic and therapeutic applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once the pleura have been inspected, samples taken (pathology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microbiology), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> therapies administered, the thoracoscope and trocars are removed and a chest tube is inserted for re-inflation of the lung and fluid drainage. Extra holes may be placed in the intrathoracic component of the chest tube to ease fluid drainage after pleurodesis. Chest radiographs are typically routinely performed after thoracoscopy. Assuring there is no air leak clinically and radiographically, the chest tube can be removed within a few hours when thoracoscopy does not involve a lung biopsy or pleurodesis, longer if patients undergo a pleurodesis. Management of chest tubes and indications for removal are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Inpatient stay is not mandatory but is typically required when chest tubes need to remain in place, particularly for more invasive procedures including lung biopsy and pleurodesis or when complications occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. However, for more minor procedures including pleural inspection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parietal pleural biopsy, where chest tube removal occurs within hours, the patient may be managed as an outpatient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-thoracoscopy-pleuroscopy-equipment-procedure-and-complications/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical thoracoscopy is a relatively safe procedure with most complications due to <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/anesthesia</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the associated diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3671355696\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation or anesthesia-related</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the complications associated with thoracoscopy are sedation or anesthesia-related (eg, hypotension, hypoxemia, respiratory arrest, arrhythmias), the details of which are discussed separately.

The following complications have been noted occurring in less than 2 percent of cases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A persistent air leak (&gt;7 days) &ndash; Air leaks are more likely to occur when the visceral pleura or lung is torn or biopsied. Bronchopleural fistula is unusual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcutaneous emphysema &ndash; This occurs due to pneumothorax or insufflation of air and typically resolves once a chest tube is in place. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; Fever is not infrequent particularly after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a> and usually resolves within 48 hours. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhage &ndash; Hemorrhage is unusual since local hemostasis is achieved during the procedure but may be noted with chest tube drainage.

Some surgeons use carbon dioxide during video assisted thoracoscopic surgery since it diffuses rapidly and is thought to be less likely to result in air embolism. However, most pulmonologists use air without any apparent increased risk of air embolism, in our experience.

Medical thoracoscopy is most commonly used for pleural fluid drainage, pleural biopsy, and pleurodesis. Although the equipment and some applications are similar to those used in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), it is typically more limited in its diagnostic and therapeutic functions and performed by pulmonologists, thus the term &quot;medical&quot; thoracoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rigid thoracoscope is probably still the more common instrument used for medical thoracoscopy. The semi-rigid fiberoptic video pleuroscope combines rigid and flexible thoracoscope features with a tip that can be flexed or extended resulting in improved maneuverability. The choice between the rigid and semi-rigid instruments is based on the procedure and preference of the operator. Accessories are available for both instruments including probes for palpation, needles for aspiration, and forceps for coagulation or biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Instruments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of entry points and their location need to be chosen in advance, typically using pre-procedure imaging (eg, computed tomography) and bedside ultrasonography. Most cases are performed under local anesthesia and procedural sedation. The intercostal space is dissected and the lung partially collapsed to safely introduce the thoracoscope into the pleural space. The pleural cavity is inspected, and if indicated, fluid is drained, samples taken, and sclerosant administered. (See <a href=\"#H1721864078\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical thoracoscopy is a relatively safe procedure. Most complications are minor, occur in 2 to 6 percent of cases and are due to <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/anesthesia</span>. Procedure-related complications include persistent air leak, subcutaneous emphysema, fever, hemorrhage, and infections. Air embolism, re-expansion pulmonary edema, and death are rare.
