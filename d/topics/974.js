Starvation induces protein and fat catabolism that leads to loss of cellular volume and atrophy of the heart, brain, liver, intestines, kidneys, and muscles. As an example, muscle wasting, including the myocardium, occurs during starvation in order to provide amino acids for production of glucose. The number of organ systems adversely affected increases with the severity of weight loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F67080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67080 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>The reported incidence of these medical complications varies, depending upon individual predispositions and severity of the current episode of anorexia nervosa, as reported in cross-sectional studies and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The primary risk factors for developing medical complications in anorexia nervosa are the degree of weight loss and the chronicity of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

This leads to decreased cardiac output, reduced exercise capacity, an attenuated blood pressure response to exercise, and subjective fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some individuals may also display decreased contractility.

The weakened heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and heart size normalizes with clinical recovery over weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Patients with anorexia nervosa may complain of chest pain or palpitations, which are often due to mitral valve prolapse. The valve prolapses as the patient loses weight because the heart muscle decreases in size while the structural tissue that comprises the mitral valve remains the same size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. One echocardiography study of patients with anorexia nervosa (n = 40) found mitral valve prolapse in 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Physical examination in patients with the mitral valve prolapse syndrome often reveals a systolic murmur and &ldquo;click,&rdquo; but there are no associated ECG findings. Clinically significant regurgitation is rare, and there are no known cases that required mitral valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In addition, QT interval prolongation may be seen in some patients, but it is unlikely that anorexia nervosa directly causes the syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>There are no electrocardiogram (ECG) findings specific to anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Aside from bradycardia, the ECG is often normal. Case reports describe ST and T-wave changes, atrioventricular block, or ventricular arrhythmia, particularly in patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. An ECG at baseline will screen for these potential abnormalities. ECG abnormalities should dissipate with weight restoration and correction of any underlying electrolyte abnormality. An overview of management of arrhythmias is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-management-for-the-primary-care-clinician\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia management for the primary care clinician&quot;</a>.) </p><p>QT dispersion refers to the difference between the maximum QT interval and the minimum QT interval occurring in any of the leads on a routine 12-lead ECG, and reflects heterogeneous ventricular depolarization. Normally, the length of the QT interval is similar between each of the ECG leads. In patients with anorexia nervosa, increased QT dispersion is another marker of increased arrhythmic risk, particularly in patients who weigh less than 80 percent of ideal body weight (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ideal-body-weight-method-of-devine-and-dosing-weight-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. The etiology of increased QT dispersion in anorexia nervosa is unknown but may be due to direct injury of the myocardium during starvation. Patients with anorexia nervosa may have a twofold or greater increase in QT dispersion, which correlates with the severity of their weight loss and reduced metabolic rate. The abnormality normalizes with refeeding. QT dispersion is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;QT dispersion: Measurement and interpretation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=qt-dispersion-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;QT dispersion: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Concerns have been raised that anorexia nervosa causes QT interval prolongation, which predisposes patients to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/2,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,38</a>]. Some studies have documented QT interval prolongation in severe anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], which normalized after weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/14,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,39</a>]. However, other studies have found that the QT interval is usually normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Many authorities think that the QT interval is not inherently prolonged in anorexia nervosa, and that QT prolongation does not independently cause sudden death in patients with anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, the presence of a long QT interval in a patient with anorexia nervosa should prompt a search for an electrolyte disturbance or the presence of the congenital long QT syndrome. The long QT syndrome is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Myocardial repolarization reserve may be impaired in anorexia nervosa. A prospective study of adolescents with anorexia nervosa (n = 61) and healthy controls matched on age and sex (n = 45) found that in the absence of QT prolongation, patients had impaired repolarization reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In patients with anorexia nervosa, abnormal autonomic nervous system function appears to diminish heart rate variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Normally, moment-to-moment fluctuations in heart rate reflect the underlying stability of the autonomic nervous system and integration of sympathetic and parasympathetic function. Reduced heart rate variability predicts sudden death in patients with heart failure, and may also be correlated with an increased incidence of sudden death in anorexia nervosa, especially in patients who weigh less than 80 percent of ideal body weight. A decreased rate of variability suggests that the patient needs a more comprehensive cardiac evaluation. Heart rate variability is discussed separately.

In addition, there may be orthostatic hypotension (within two to five minutes of moving from a supine position to standing, a decrease in systolic blood pressure of &ge;20 mmHg, decrease in diastolic blood pressure of &ge;10 mmHg, or symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion). Symptoms of orthostasis include lightheadedness upon standing, weakness, and cognitive impairment.

Orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates that the cardiac status of patients may be deteriorating.

A study of 214 women with anorexia nervosa found that the average mean heart rate was 62 beats per minute, and that bradycardia was present in 41 percent (and hypotension in 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The reduced cardiac function and use of energy represent an adaptive, compensatory response to caloric deprivation. The cause appears to be increased parasympathetic (vagal) activity with unchanged sympathetic tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Patients typically describe nonspecific symptoms related to bradycardia, such as fatigue, weakness, and lightheadedness. Bradycardia is expected with anorexia nervosa, and should not, in and of itself, result in therapy directed to increase the heart rate. </p><p>Although clinicians might find comfort in a normal heart rate, &ldquo;relative tachycardia&rdquo; (pulse of 70 to 100) in patients with moderate to severe anorexia nervosa may have more sinister implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A normal heart rate, even if not strictly in the elevated range (pulse &gt;100), is probably due to a medication side effect, anxiety, or an impending medical complication, and should be viewed as a warning sign in need of medical evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

There are no studies that have directly addressed this question in patients with anorexia nervosa. Nearly all authorities agree on the need for hospitalization and telemetry for any adult patient with a heart rate less than 30 beats per minute. Whether the patient is admitted to an intensive care unit depends upon the presence of other clinical problems and availability of resources. The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline suggests hospitalization for a heart rate of less than 40 beats per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Normally, nerve impulses within the hypothalamus trigger the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone, which acts upon the pituitary. This initiates the release of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, which in turn determine the onset of normal menstrual function. In patients with anorexia nervosa, secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone is reduced, which ultimately prevents ovulation and causes a functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea#H689399617\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea&quot;, section on 'Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea'</a>.) </p><p>Weight loss of between 10 to 15 percent of normal weight disrupts the menstrual cycle in most women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The time course and amount of weight required for resumption of menses has varied among different studies. A two-year study of 100 adolescent females with anorexia nervosa found that resumption of menses occurred in a mean average of nine months and required a weight of 4.5 pounds (2 kg) more than the weight at which menses were lost, and that 86 percent resumed their menses within six months of achieving a weight approximately 90 to 95 percent of ideal body weight (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ideal-body-weight-method-of-devine-and-dosing-weight-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

The main symptom is bloating (gas and distension), which often occurs after eating and may be severe. Bloating is worsened by a high-fiber diet or by fiber-based laxatives. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include early satiety, fullness, nausea, and vomiting (not self-induced). Heartburn may also occur as a result of acidic, vomitus-induced esophagitis from food remaining in the stomach for prolonged periods of time.

The inflammation is usually marked by acute upper abdominal pain and elevated serum levels of pancreatic enzymes. The presumptive etiology is that malnutrition activates proteases, such as trypsin, which damage cells. In addition, rapid weight loss may cause retrograde pressure or reflux of duodenal contents into the pancreatic duct.

It results from compression of the third portion of the duodenum between the aorta posteriorly and the superior mesenteric artery anteriorly. The superior mesenteric artery is normally covered with fatty tissue; weight loss reduces the fat pad and narrows the angle between the two vessels, entrapping the duodenum and causing a small bowel obstruction. Depending upon the severity of the complication, symptoms include early satiety, abdominal pain soon after starting a meal, nausea, and vomiting. Weight gain of as little as 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) can lead to tolerance of normal feeding. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed separately.

Moisturizing ointments and humidifying the environment can ameliorate the problem and relieve pruritus. Lanugo hair on the back, abdomen, and forearms is not a sign of virilization. Carotenoderma is due to excess ingestion of carotenoid-rich vegetables that are low in calories, and decreased hepatic catabolism of carotene. Acne can be caused by starvation, but may also be a risk factor for anorexia nervosa, in that a new dieting behavior intended to control acne may additionally lead to weight loss and then anorexia nervosa. Seborrheic dermatitis (most commonly on the scalp) should be treated with medicated shampoos. Acrocyanosis is associated with arterial vasoconstriction and secondary dilation of venules, and may represent a mechanism by which the body conserves heat.

The number of organ systems adversely affected increases with the severity of weight loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F67080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67080 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5205559\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for each medical complication of anorexia nervosa includes nutritional replenishment, and many complications resolve with weight gain. There are no randomized trials that have evaluated the management of complications from anorexia nervosa. Some patients will require hospitalization to manage the illness and its medical complications. (See <a href=\"#H5205559\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-evaluation-for-medical-complications-and-criteria-for-hospitalization-to-manage-these-complications#H86793902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults: Evaluation for medical complications and criteria for hospitalization to manage these complications&quot;, section on 'Inpatient hospitalization'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular complications of anorexia nervosa involve structural abnormalities, including decreased cardiac mass, reduced cardiac chamber volumes, mitral valve prolapse, and pericardial effusion. In addition, functional changes include bradycardia, increased QT dispersion, and hypotension. A prolonged QT interval may be seen in some patients, but it is not clear whether anorexia nervosa directly causes the syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H8741290\" class=\"local\">'Structural changes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8741312\" class=\"local\">'Functional changes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reproductive system is altered in anorexia nervosa, causing a cascade of events resulting in secondary amenorrhea. Many patients have amenorrhea (functional hypothalamic amenorrhea). Normal menstrual cycles usually resume with weight gain. However, amenorrhea persists in about 10 to 30 percent of patients with anorexia nervosa despite weight gain. (See <a href=\"#H31379371\" class=\"local\">'Gynecologic and reproductive'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may become pregnant despite their amenorrheic state. Fertility is intact in patients who recover from anorexia nervosa and remain stable. However, there is a higher rate of pregnancy and neonatal complications in anorexia nervosa. (See <a href=\"#H31379385\" class=\"local\">'Fertility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with anorexia nervosa have endocrine complications, including hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities that contribute to severe bone loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-endocrine-complications-and-their-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa: Endocrine complications and their management&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroparesis consistently occurs in anorexia nervosa. For patients with anorexia nervosa and gastroparesis, we suggest using liquid food supplements to provide half of the daily calories for the first week or two of refeeding; ingesting liquid components earlier in each meal; dividing the daily calorie intake into three small meals and two snacks per day; and avoiding legume-type foods, excessive fiber, and bran products; rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>, to restore bowel function (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Unresponsive gastroparesis can be treated with metoclopramide 2.5 mg, 30 minutes before meals and at bedtime. (See <a href=\"#H440172\" class=\"local\">'Gastroparesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation also occurs often in anorexia nervosa. For patients with anorexia nervosa and constipation, we suggest six to eight glasses of water per day, fiber 10 grams per day, and polyethylene glycol powder one to three tablespoons per day, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a>, to restore bowel function (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Unresponsive constipation can be treated with lactulose 30 to 60 mL one to two times per day. (See <a href=\"#H440179\" class=\"local\">'Constipation'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-and-adolescents-medical-complications-and-their-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Westmoreland P, Krantz MJ, Mehler PS.
