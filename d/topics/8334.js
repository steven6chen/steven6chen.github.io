Before you use a metered dose inhaler for the first time, you need to get it ready. This is called &quot;priming.&quot; To do this, you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the cap off the mouthpiece</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shake the inhaler for 5 seconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61575 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press down on the canister to spray the medicine into the air (away from your face)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat these steps 1 to 3 more times, depending on the type of inhaler</p><p/><p>If your child hasn't used the inhaler for more than a few days to weeks, depending on the type of inhaler, you need to follow the steps above before using the inhaler again. Check the instructions or ask your child's doctor or pharmacist about when you need to prime your child's inhaler.</p><p>After the inhaler is ready, your child can use it as prescribed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13423348\"><span class=\"h1\">How should my child use the inhaler?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each inhaler has its own directions. Your doctor or nurse will show you how your child should use his or her inhaler.</p><p>Almost all children with asthma use an inhaler with a &quot;spacer.&quot; A spacer is a device that attaches to the inhaler's mouthpiece (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56533 \">picture 2</a>). Pressing down on the canister causes the puff of medicine to spray into the spacer. Then it sits there until the person breathes it in. Some spacers also come with a face mask.</p><p>In general, to use your child's metered dose inhaler, you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the cap off the mouthpiece and put the inhaler in the spacer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shake the inhaler for 5 seconds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the inhaler upright with 1 finger on the top of the canister, the thumb on the bottom of the inhaler, and your other hand holding the spacer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child breathe out normally</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child close his or her lips around the mouthpiece of the spacer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75577\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75577 \">figure 1</a>). If the spacer has a face mask, hold the face mask snugly over your child's mouth and nose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press down on the canister</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child breathe in deeply and slowly and hold his or her breath for 5 to 10 seconds. Have your child let his or her breath out, then repeat the breath holding again. If a mask is used, have your child breathe in and out normally for 10 seconds instead of holding his or her breath. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your child is supposed to take 2 puffs of the inhaler, wait 15 to 30 seconds before you give the second puff. Shake the inhaler again before the second puff.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the inhaler from the spacer and put the cap back on the mouthpiece, or leave the inhaler in the spacer for the next use</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the inhaler is a steroid medicine (also called a &quot;glucocorticoid&quot; or &quot;corticosteroid&quot;), have your child rinse out his or her mouth, gargle, and spit out the water</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13423355\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to clean the inhaler?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your child uses the inhaler every day, you need to clean it at least once a week. If your child doesn't use the inhaler every day, you can clean it less often. To know when you need to clean it, look inside the mouthpiece. Clean the inhaler when you see powder in or around the hole.</p><p>To clean an inhaler, you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the canister and cap from the mouthpiece. Do not wash the canister or put the canister under water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Run warm water through the mouthpiece for 30 to 60 seconds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shake the water off of the mouthpiece and let it air dry</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13423362\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to clean the spacer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your child uses the spacer each day, you should clean it every 1 to 2 weeks. First, remove the inhaler from the spacer. Wash the spacer with warm water and dishwashing soap, but do <strong>not</strong> rinse it. Then let it air dry. Leaving the spacer a little soapy after cleaning actually helps it work better.</p><p>If your child uses an InspirEase chamber every day, replace the bag every 1 to 2 weeks or right away if there is a hole in the bag (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56533 \">picture 2</a>). Clean the mouthpiece in warm running water and let it air dry. Do not wash the bag.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13423369\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if my child's inhaler is empty?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some inhalers come with a built-in dose counter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69302\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69302 \">picture 3</a>). A counter keeps track of how many doses are left in the inhaler.</p><p>When the counter reads 0 (zero), it's time to throw out the inhaler. That's because there is no more medicine in it. Make sure to have another inhaler on hand before the counter reads 0.</p><p>If the inhaler doesn't have a built-in counter, you need to keep track of the number of doses left in it. Based on how often your child uses the inhaler, you can figure out when he or she will need a refill and write this date down.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13423376\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-childs-dry-powder-inhaler-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your child's dry powder inhaler (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise-induced asthma (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
