Either skin prick tests or in vitro tests for IgE are usually performed initially. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-in-vitro-allergy-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of in vitro allergy tests&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With the exception of in vitro immunoassays for specific IgE (which are still erroneously referred to as IgE RAST [radioallergosorbent test] tests), other diagnostic allergy procedures, including skin testing and food challenges, should be performed by allergy specialists with training in the management of serious allergic reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenges (DBPCFC) are the gold standard for the diagnosis of food allergy. A clinician-supervised oral food challenge is required if the history and IgE test results do not clearly indicate an allergy. The use of challenges in the diagnosis of food allergy is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The skin prick test wheal size and level of specific IgE correlate with the likelihood of an allergic reaction but by themselves are not diagnostic of food allergy in the absence of a clear history of a clinical reaction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are fairly consistent positive predictive values (PPVs) for various allergy tests for peanut. Similar data for tree nuts and seeds are limited, and testing does not appear to be as predictive for some of these foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies using the ImmunoCAP have demonstrated that an IgE level of 13 to 15 kU<sub>A</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> to peanut has a 95 to 99 percent PPV for clinical reactivity to peanut in children with suggestive histories of allergic reactivity (most also had a history of eczema, and many had asthma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/1,3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-6</a>]. However, as noted previously, over 25 percent of children with peanut-specific IgE &gt;15 kU<sub>A</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> had negative food challenges in one series (lower negative predictive value [NPV]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], primarily due to high levels of Ara h 8.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False positives occur more frequently in areas where birch pollen sensitivity is common due to crossreactivity between the major birch pollen protein, Bet v 1, and the peanut protein, Ara h 8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The use of component-resolved diagnostic assays (ie, quantitation of IgE to specific food proteins) suggests that elevated levels of Ara h 2-specific IgE are more diagnostic of systemic reactivity to peanut than whole peanut-specific IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>] and isolated sensitization to Ara h 8 indicates clinical tolerance or only mild (primarily oropharyngeal) reactivity in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, elevated peanut-specific IgE antibody levels alone are not diagnostic of food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Similarly, component protein-specific IgE levels (ie, Cor a 9 and 14) are more diagnostic for systemic reactions to hazelnut than whole hazelnut-specific IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Component testing is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=component-testing-for-pollen-related-plant-derived-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Component testing for pollen-related, plant-derived food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On skin prick testing, a wheal size of &ge;8 mm has a 95 to 100 percent PPV for peanut allergy in children with suspected peanut allergy in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/3,6,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,15-18</a>]. A wheal of &ge;4 mm has a PPV of approximately 100 percent in children &le;2 years of age. However, the NPV is poor. In one study, for example, nearly one-half of the children with peanut skin test wheal sizes &gt;8 mm had a negative food challenge. Thus, skin testing alone is not diagnostic of food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Sensitivities and NPVs at these decision points or cutoff levels are generally poor. Patients with negative tests, particularly specific IgE, may still be clinically allergic. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic pitfalls'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, these test results do not reflect the severity of the allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/4,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19,20</a>]. Diagnostic tools are under investigation that may help predict reaction severity and also distinguish between patients who are only sensitized versus those who are clinically allergic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=future-diagnostic-tools-for-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Future diagnostic tools for food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical history is very important for guiding the diagnostic evaluation in a patient with suspected peanut, tree nut, or seed allergy. Foods suspected of provoking an IgE-mediated reaction may be evaluated with skin prick tests, which indicate whether or not the patient has IgE antibodies to the suspected food. The larger the mean wheal diameter of the skin prick test, the greater the likelihood that the food being tested is the cause of the allergic reaction.</p><p>Obtaining food-specific IgE levels (eg, ImmunoCAP) to foods suspected by history or by the presence of positive skin tests provides further evidence regarding whether or not a specific food is the cause of a suspected allergic reaction, as described previously. However, an oral food challenge should be performed if these tests are positive in the absence of a suggestive history or in the presence of an equivocal history. Similarly, an oral food challenge should be performed to establish the diagnosis if these tests are negative in the face of a convincing history.</p><p>We generally do not test related foods (eg, almond in a patient with a suspected reaction to cashew) if they are already in the diet and were eaten recently.</p><p>We skin test to sesame in patients with peanut allergy if they have never ingested sesame or the history of exposure is unclear. If the test is positive, we check sesame-specific IgE by ImmunoCAP. We suggest a challenge to sesame if the level is &le;20 kU<sub>A</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span>. We advise avoidance if the level is &gt;20 kU<sub>A</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/L,</span> although we will perform a clinician-supervised food challenge to sesame in these patients also if the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> would like to have sesame in the diet. If the skin test is negative, sesame may be introduced into the diet.</p><p>Patients with peanut allergy who are not ingesting tree nuts should also be tested to tree nuts prior to introducing them into their diet since approximately 35 percent of children with a peanut allergy also have a tree nut allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We follow a similar approach to that outlined above for sesame. We generally suggest avoidance and will not perform a challenge if the tree nut-specific IgE level is &gt;15 kU<sub>A</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> (except for hazelnut, which tends to run much higher levels in patients with concomitant birch allergy due to crossreactivity to birch pollen; acquiring Cor a 9- and 14-specific IgE levels may clarify the need for an oral food challenge).

Similarly, in a United Kingdom population-based birth cohort, 12 percent were sensitized to peanut at eight years of age, but only 2 percent were allergic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The higher rate of sensitization than clinical allergy may be due in part to cross-reactions to homologous plant allergens, such as birch and grass pollen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peanut-tree-nut-and-seed-allergy-diagnosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].
