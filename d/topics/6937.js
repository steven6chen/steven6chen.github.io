(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemolytic anemia is caused by one of two mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities arising from within the RBC <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its membrane (intracorpuscular defects). These are usually congenital (eg, sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, hereditary spherocytosis), but may rarely be acquired, as in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities in the environment of the RBC. These processes are, by definition, extracorpuscular, and the ensuing hemolysis is called extrinsic hemolytic anemia.</p><p/><p>Extracorpuscular hemolytic anemia is often due to immune mechanisms, as in warm and cold agglutinin hemolytic anemia. However, there are many nonimmune causes, including systemic diseases, mechanical destruction (ie, fragmentation hemolysis), increased destruction within an enlarged spleen (hypersplenism), and the action of toxins and drugs.

However, serum haptoglobin is not a specific indicator of intravascular hemolysis since it can be low or absent with brisk extravascular hemolysis.

Since microvascular abnormalities are frequently involved in causing RBC fragmentation, the condition is often called a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA). When associated with microvascular thrombi and thrombocytopenia, a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is often inferred.

These conditions are associated with MAHA and thrombocytopenia; in some cases, organ ischemia may also occur.

DIC has a variety of causes, the most common of which are sepsis, trauma, malignancy, and obstetrical complications; less common causes include large hemangiomas (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome) and large abdominal aortic aneurysms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58104 \">table 2</a>).

In addition, there may be a hypercoagulable state associated with cancer (ie, migratory superficial thrombophlebitis or Trousseau's Syndrome) that causes DIC. The hypercoagulable state is primarily due to two factors expressed by circulating tumor cells: tissue factor and cancer procoagulant, a calcium-dependent cysteine protease that is not seen in normally differentiated tissue.

The presumed mechanism is the associated <span class=\"nowrap\">endothelial/vascular</span> injury, which, in turn, leads to fibrin strand formation, shearing of RBCs, and the trapping and removal of platelets. Very rapid control of the hypertension is critical; with good control the survival rate at 5 years is 75 percent.

Blood cells leave the splenic arterial bed through afferent arterioles, which pass through lymphoid nodules (the white pulp), and then terminate in the cords of Billroth (the red pulp), into which the blood cells are discharged. The normal slow flow through the cords permits highly selective action on the blood cells by macrophages, which have receptors that can detect alterations in the blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. These receptors include the Fc receptor for the appropriate portion of the immunoglobulin molecule, receptors for complement components such as C3b, and perhaps receptors that detect alterations in the outer portion of the RBC phospholipid bilayer or in the externally oriented glycopeptides.</p><p>The macrophage then holds, retards, modifies (&quot;pits&quot;), or removes (&quot;culls&quot;) such RBCs. The normal pitting function of the spleen allows it to remove nuclear residua (Howell-Jolly bodies) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60588\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60588 \">picture 4</a>) and normally occurring endocytic vacuoles (called &quot;pits&quot; or &quot;pocks&quot; because of their appearance on interference-phase or Nomarski microscopy). The normal culling function of the spleen is exemplified by its removal of senescent RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The blood cells must then traverse the cords in order to approach and pass though slits in the sinus wall to reenter the circulation. These slits are 2 to 3 microns in size and are usually endothelialized on one side, with a macrophage lining on the other side. The normal human adult RBC is a discocyte, with a surface area 40 percent larger than a sphere of that volume. It is this excess surface area that allows RBCs of 8 micron diameter to twist, elongate, and deform sufficiently to squeeze through the 2 to 3 micron slits. This excess of surface area is critical, and the normal RBC has a surface area-to-volume <span class=\"nowrap\">(SA/V)</span> ratio of about 1.4. Any condition that reduces the <span class=\"nowrap\">SA/V</span> ratio reduces the ability of RBCs to traverse these sinusoidal slits, because a plump, surface area-depleted sphere cannot undergo the requisite elliptical deformation sufficiently.

As an example, oxidant attack may produce Heinz bodies that come to be adjacent to the membrane. The Heinz bodies interfere with the smooth movement of the membrane over the cytosol, called &quot;tank treading.&quot; Such cells are selectively blocked from leaving the splenic cords and entering the sinuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Other factors that may play a role are the state of activation of the splenic macrophages and the size of the small slits between the splenic cords and sinuses. Both macrophages and slits seem to be under a degree of control, as evidenced by variations in splenic removal of RBCs in patients infected with malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p>The clinical picture of hypersplenic extravascular hemolysis is dominated by the specific cause of the splenomegaly (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;</a>).

The anemia or pancytopenia is usually not very profound. However, splenectomy may be considered if the anemia or other cytopenia is very severe. It is important to appreciate that massive splenomegaly is frequently associated with expansion of the plasma volume; as a result, the hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, or red cell count may give a falsely low estimate of the actual red cell mass. If this is suspected, the true RBC mass can be determined by a Cr-51 red cell mass determination, which can also be used to estimate RBC survival.</p><p>In one study of 19 patients with severe liver disease, hypersplenism, and a mean platelet count of <span class=\"nowrap\">15,400/microL,</span> successful live donor liver transplantation resulted in a gradual decrease in splenic volume with no significant change in the platelet count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Kupffer cells and hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While not strictly a mechanism of hypersplenism, erythrophagocytosis by hepatic Kupffer cells is a prominent finding in patients undergoing graft-versus-host hemolysis after ABO-mismatched liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H163670450\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
