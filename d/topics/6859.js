While wheezing typically brings to mind airway obstruction from bronchoconstriction or excessive mucus production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor clearance due to asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), wheezing is also caused by a spectrum of other processes that cause airflow limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-illnesses-other-than-asthma-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. These processes may be present on their own or may coexist with asthma or COPD, contributing to difficult to control symptoms. When evaluating wheezing, it may be helpful to recall the adage, &quot;All that wheezes is not asthma [or COPD]; all that wheezes is obstruction.&quot;</p><p>An overview of wheezing illnesses in adults, other than asthma or COPD, is presented here. The diagnosis of asthma, COPD, and wheezing illnesses in children are discussed separately.

Wheezes are usually high pitched, consist of single or multiple notes, occur during inspiration or expiration (more commonly expiration), and originate from airways of any size, from the large extrathoracic upper airway to the intrathoracic small airways. Stridor refers to a monophonic sound that is loudest over the anterior neck and is typically high-pitched and predominantly inspiratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-illnesses-other-than-asthma-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Stridor is sometimes characterized as a type of wheeze due to the overlapping sound signal frequencies of wheeze and stridor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-illnesses-other-than-asthma-in-adults/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].

In patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis, the vocal cords may be adducted to a median position and cause airflow obstruction that is greater during inspiration than expiration. During expiration, the paralyzed cords open due to the force of airflow during exhalation. In adults, bilateral vocal cord paralysis is most often a consequence of neck surgery or translaryngeal tracheal intubation, but can also be a consequence of a broad spectrum of neurologic disorders.

Patients often present with inspiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> expiratory wheezing. Some patients have concomitant asthma or have been misdiagnosed with asthma. The diagnosis of PVCM is confirmed by laryngoscopy (sometimes following exercise) showing abnormal adduction of the true cords (during inspiration, throughout the respiratory cycle, or rarely just during expiration). The glottic aperture may be obliterated except for a posterior diamond-shaped passage.

The upper airway is divided into intra and extrathoracic components by the thoracic inlet, which is about 1 cm above the suprasternal notch on the anterior chest. During the respiratory cycle, the intrathoracic airway diameter is affected by changes in pleural pressures across the airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55931 \">figure 3B</a>), while the extrathoracic airway is more affected by changes in intraluminal pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65386\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65386 \">figure 3A</a>). Lesions that are fixed are not affected by these changes in pressure and affect flow during inspiration and expiration. Thus, the flow volume loop can be used to help determine whether airflow obstruction is caused by an intrathoracic or extrathoracic obstruction and also distinguish whether the obstructing lesion is variable or fixed based (ie, the severity of obstruction changes during inspiration and expiration) based on the following features (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-volume-loops\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow-volume loops&quot;</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variable obstruction &ndash; It is possible to distinguish extrathoracic from intrathoracic upper airway lesions if the obstruction is variable (ie, the obstructing process responds to the normal transmural pressure changes). A variable extrathoracic obstruction (eg, vocal cord paralysis) is typically apparent only during a maximal inspiratory effort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63544\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63544 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60463\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60463 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57161\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57161 \">figure 6</a>). The maximal expiratory flow-volume curve and expiratory spirometry are usually normal in this setting, because the extrathoracic airway will be pushed open during expiration. In contrast, a variable intrathoracic obstruction (eg, distal tracheomalacia) is most apparent during maximal expiratory effort (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63544\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63544 \">figure 4</a>), and spirometry reveals values consistent with expiratory airflow obstruction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to visual inspection of the graph, the ratio of inspiratory to expiratory flow rates can help distinguish variable extrathoracic from intrathoracic upper airway lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-illnesses-other-than-asthma-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Inspiratory flow rates are normally greater than expiratory flow rates when compared at lung volumes in the lower two-thirds of the vital capacity. When a variable extrathoracic lesion is present, inspiratory flow rates are lower than expiratory, such that the ratio of forced inspiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity <span class=\"nowrap\">(FIF50)/forced</span> expiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity (FEF50) is less than 1.

However, fixed central airway obstructions give the flow-volume loop a characteristic box shape (flow limitation during inspiration and expiration) that suggests the obstruction is in the large rather than small airways. Airflow is uniformly impeded during inspiration and expiration, causing flattening of both the maximum inspiratory and expiratory curves because there is no difference between the amount of narrowing in inspiration and expiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-illnesses-other-than-asthma-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheal lesions &ndash; In general, spirometric values cannot distinguish large from small intrathoracic airway disease, because the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/forced</span> vital capacity (FVC) are reduced in both situations. However, sometimes variable tracheal obstruction may be manifest as a horizontal line in the middle portion of a maximum expiratory effort (instead of the normal gradual descent), as airflow is likely to remain constant when there is only one site of obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63544\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63544 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57161\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57161 \">figure 6</a>).

Narrowing of short segments of the trachea (eg, malignant and benign tumors, extrinsic compression, and granulomatous processes) is difficult to identify on the conventional chest radiograph. Similarly, the chest radiograph is not a good screening test for bronchiectasis or bronchiolitis in adults, although increased bronchovascular markings and &ldquo;tram tracks&rdquo; may be seen in bronchiectasis.

Chest CT with contrast can identify vascular rings, aneurysms of the major vessels, mediastinal masses, or lymphadenopathy that compress the trachea extrinsically. Axial CT can often identify long segments of tracheal stenosis, but short segments of tracheal stenosis can be missed. Two and three dimensional reconstruction of the central airway images from high-resolution multidetector CT (MDCT) has been reported to identify airway lesions missed on standard chest and tracheal CT images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-wheezing-illnesses-other-than-asthma-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Tracheal collapsibility is assessed based on changes in the shape and cross sectional area of the trachea between full inspiration and forced exhalation. Flattening of tracheal rings due to tracheomalacia gives a crescent shape to the trachea, while hyperdynamic airway collapse has intact tracheal rings with bulging of the posterior tracheal wall into the airway lumen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F89247\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89247 \">figure 2</a>).

If asthma and COPD are likely, nebulized bronchodilator treatment is immediately given. If there is evidence of anaphylaxis, subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> should be given immediately. (See <a href=\"#H110195692\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of acute wheeze and respiratory distress'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with impending respiratory failure (ie, impaired oxygenation by pulse oximetry, increased arterial tension of carbon dioxide) and suspicion of central airway obstruction, endotracheal intubation by an experienced clinician should precede a diagnostic evaluation if the initial measures have failed to improve the situation. If endotracheal intubation cannot be immediately performed, inhalation of a helium-oxygen mixture may provide temporary stabilization of respiratory status. For severe tracheal obstruction, use of an open ventilating rigid bronchoscope may be necessary. In these patients, the diagnostic evaluation proceeds concomitantly with steps to provide adequate ventilation.

For patients who do not meet criteria for asthma or COPD or do not respond appropriately to a trial of bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory medication, a careful examination of the flow volume loop is in order. The flow volume loop can be used to help determine whether the obstruction is fixed or variable and whether it is likely to be intrathoracic or extrathoracic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65386%7EPULM%2F55931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65386 graphicRef55931 \">figure 3A-B</a>).
