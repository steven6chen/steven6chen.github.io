The designation Q fever (from Query) was made in 1935 following an outbreak of febrile illness in an abattoir in Queensland, Australia. </p><p>The microbiology and epidemiology of Q fever will be reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Q fever are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Q fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=q-fever-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Q fever endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. burnetii</em> is a short, pleomorphic rod that is a strict intracellular bacterium. While previously designated as a <em>Rickettsia</em>, <em>C. burnetii</em> has been re-classified as a Proteobacteria, which is closer to <em>Legionella</em> and <em>Francisella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>C. burnetii</em> can be cultivated in embryonated eggs, laboratory animals, and in vitro cell culture systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It can also be cultured in axenic (host cell-free) media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>In mammals, the usual host cell of <em>C. burnetii</em> is the macrophage, which is unable to kill the bacterium. <em>C. burnetii</em> lives and multiplies in a single, large, acidic vacuole, which results from the fusion of cell lysosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, a sporulation-like process protects the organism from the external environment, where it can survive for long periods of time.</p><p>An important characteristic of <em>C. burnetii</em> is its antigenic variation, called &quot;phase variation&quot;. When <em>C. burnetii</em> express phase I antigen it is highly infectious and a single bacterium is sufficient to infect a human. This is the form that is isolated from animals or humans. After subculturing <em>C. burnetii</em> in cells or embryonated eggs, modification of its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) capsule results in an antigenic shift to the phase II form, which is not infectious. This antigenic shift can be measured and forms the basis for differentiating acute from chronic Q fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1040523\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The geographic distribution of Q fever is worldwide with a few exceptions, such as New Zealand. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large outbreaks have been reported in Switzerland, Great Britain, Germany, and in southern France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In southern France, the numbers of cases and outbreaks related to acute Q fever have steadily increased; in 2009, 4 percent of blood samples sent for serologic testing were reactive compared with 1 percent in 1989 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Cases of acute Q fever in Europe occur more frequently in spring and early summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In North America, Nova Scotia has been the location of a significant number of cases. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest outbreak ever described occurred in the Netherlands in 2009, where it was previously unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In French Guiana, Q fever causes approximately 25 percent of community acquired pneumonias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Infections in this area are linked to the presence of a single genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cases of Q fever have been reported in armed forces personnel returning from Iraq [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p>Since the clinical presentation is nonspecific, recognition of cases depends upon astute clinicians and the availability of a reference laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, incidence figures for the disease vary widely. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Reservoirs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mammals, birds, and arthropods may be reservoirs for <em>C. burnetii</em>, but the main reservoir is ticks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most commonly identified sources of human infection are farm animals, such as cattle, goats, and sheep. However, pets, including cats, rabbits, pigeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and dogs may serve as sources of urban outbreaks of human disease. Wild animals, including sloths, have been suspected as a reservoir for outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>Infected mammals shed <em>C. burnetii</em> in their urine, feces, milk, and placenta. Q fever can cause abortions in sheep and goats and low birthweight in offspring of cattle. High concentrations of <em>C. burnetii</em> (up to 10(9) bacteria per gram of tissue) may occur in the placenta of infected animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Routes of transmission to humans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans are incidental hosts for infection with <em>C. burnetii</em>. Occupational exposure to <em>C. burnetii</em> among veterinarians may occur through inhalation of contaminated aerosols arising from the placenta or parturient fluids of infected livestock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. </p><p><em>C. burnetii</em> human infection has also resulted via the following routes: a) transplacental transmission to the fetus, b) intradermal inoculation and c) blood transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Consumption of raw milk is an additional cause of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Aerosol transmission through a contaminated air conditioning system was implicated in a large outbreak among 322 students in an urban school in Israel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identifying-and-managing-casualties-of-biological-terrorism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identifying and managing casualties of biological terrorism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Human to human transmission of infection is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24</a>], and nosocomial human to human transmission has not been described. Transmission of <em>C. burnetii</em> during intercourse was implicated in a single case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The wife of a patient with occupationally-acquired Q fever developed the infection 15 days after sexual intercourse. She had no other known exposure to <em>C. burnetii</em>, and <em>C. burnetii</em> DNA was detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the husband's semen.</p><p>Exposure to soil and standing water has also been postulated as possible reservoirs of <em>C. burnetii</em> infection. As an example, in a serologic study of 508 veterinarians, risk factors associated with <em>C. burnetii</em> seropositivity included interactions with cattle, swine, or wildlife, as well as routine contact with pond water, a novel observation that requires further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a case-control study in French Guiana, patients with Q fever were more likely to have engaged in activities near a forest compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although no animal reservoirs of infection were found in this study, a subsequent report has suggested that the animal reservoir in French Guiana is the sloth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-and-epidemiology-of-q-fever/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].
