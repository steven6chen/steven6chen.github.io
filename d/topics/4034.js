As a result, there is an accumulation of leukemic blasts or immature forms in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and occasionally in other tissues, with a variable reduction in the production of normal red blood cells, platelets, and mature granulocytes. The increased production of malignant cells, along with a reduction in these mature elements, results in a variety of systemic consequences including anemia, bleeding, and an increased risk of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presenting signs and symptoms and diagnosis of AML will be reviewed in this topic.

In contrast, AML accounts for less than 10 percent of acute leukemias in children less than 10 years of age. In the United States and Europe, the incidence is reported as 3 to 5 cases per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>In adults, the median age at diagnosis is approximately 65 years. The incidence increases with age with approximately 2 and 20 cases per 100,000 population for those under or over 65 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The male:female ratio is approximately 5:3. This incidence is similar among persons of different races. In one study, non-Hispanic Whites had the highest incidence (4 cases per 100,000 population), while Hispanic Whites, Blacks, and Asian Pacific Islanders had a slightly lower incidence (3 cases per 100,000 population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>AML has been associated with environmental factors (eg, exposure to chemicals, radiation, tobacco, chemotherapy) and genetic abnormalities (eg, trisomy 21; Fanconi anemia; Bloom's syndrome; familial mutations of <em>CEBPA</em>, <em>DDX41</em>, <em>RUNX1</em>). In some patients, evolution to AML is preceded by evidence of clonal hematopoiesis manifest as myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasms, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and aplastic anemia. Details regarding these associations and the pathogenesis of AML are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Two-hit hypothesis of leukemogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-acute-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H356931794\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Screening patients with acute leukemia or MDS'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with AML generally present with symptoms related to complications of pancytopenia (eg, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia), including weakness and easy fatigability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], infections of variable severity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemorrhagic findings such as gingival bleeding, ecchymoses, epistaxis, or menorrhagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Combinations of these symptoms are common.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General fatigue is present in the majority of patients and often precedes the diagnosis for a number of months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pallor and weakness are common and attributed to the anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone pain is infrequent in adults with AML, although some individuals describe sternal discomfort or tenderness, occasionally with aching in the long bones. This may be especially severe in the lower extremities, due to expansion of the medullary cavity by the leukemic process.</p><p/><p>It is generally difficult to precisely date the onset of AML, at least in part because individuals have different symptomatic thresholds for choosing to seek medical attention. It is likely that most patients have had more subtle evidence of bone marrow involvement for weeks, or perhaps months, before diagnosis. This can sometimes make the distinction between de novo leukemia and leukemia associated with a prior hematologic disorder such as a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) somewhat arbitrary. As an example, it is not uncommon for a patient to present with AML and to find evidence of a possible undiagnosed and asymptomatic MDS from blood counts obtained months to years earlier.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If fever is present, it is almost always related to infection; as such, fever should always prompt a thorough investigation of potential infectious sites and trigger immediate empiric administration of broad spectrum antibiotics if neutropenia (&lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">neutrophils/microL)</span> is present. Whether functional neutropenia occurs in AML is less clear, but morphologic identification of hypogranular or dysplastic neutrophils in a peripheral blood smear is suggestive of such a deficit and could support the use of empiric antibiotic therapy in the absence of significant neutropenia. A small minority of patients has fever related solely to the underlying leukemia, which abates with appropriate chemotherapy; this phenomenon may be more common in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

A dental examination should be included in the pretreatment evaluation so that effective dental prophylaxis (eg, extractions) can be performed, if time and blood counts permit, prior to beginning chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Organomegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpable adenopathy is uncommon in patients with AML and significant lymph node enlargement is rare.

Extramedullary disease may present simultaneously with or precede bone marrow disease, and may be seen in relapse. When found in association with blood or bone marrow involvement, it occurs most commonly as either cutaneous or gingival infiltration by leukemic cells, and is most often seen when there is a prominent monocytic component to the leukemia (eg, in acute monocytic or monoblastic leukemia or in acute myelomonocytic leukemia).</p><p>Sites of isolated myeloid sarcoma include bone, periosteum, soft tissues, and lymph nodes, and less commonly the orbit, intestine, mediastinum, epidural region, uterus, and ovary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/21-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-27</a>]. Myeloid sarcoma should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of a &quot;small round blue cell tumor,&quot; and should be more seriously suspected if eosinophilic myelocytes are seen on hematoxylin and eosin-stained biopsies. The definitive diagnosis rests on identifying the tumor cells as myeloid with the use of myeloperoxidase or lysozyme staining, flow cytometry, or immunophenotyping from tissue sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Differential diagnostic considerations for myeloid sarcoma include extramedullary blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia, or the acute leukemic transformations of other chronic disorders such as myeloproliferative neoplasms, particularly primary myelofibrosis. Careful review of the patient's history and correlation with other findings in the blood and bone marrow will make these apparent.</p><p>It is important to note that the approach to treatment of patients with myeloid sarcoma without evidence of AML on bone marrow biopsy is similar to that for patients with overt AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/12,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28</a>].

Importantly, tumor lysis syndrome is an oncologic emergency that should be suspected in patients with hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperkalemia.

In addition, the presence of high numbers of metabolically active circulating white cells can interfere with certain laboratory tests. This can result in spuriously high potassium and decreased serum glucose. Hypoxemia in an arterial blood gas may be seen with normal arterial oxygen saturation levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The reticulocyte count is normal or decreased. Approximately 75 percent of patients have platelet counts below 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (100 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L)</span> at diagnosis, and approximately 25 percent will have counts below 25,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. Both morphologic and functional platelet abnormalities may be seen.</p><p>The median leukocyte count at diagnosis is approximately 15,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL;</span> 20 percent of patients have a leukocyte count above 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and 25 to 40 percent of patients have a leukocyte count less than 5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. The vast majority of patients (95 percent) will have circulating myeloblasts that can be detected on the peripheral smear. There may or may not be evidence of myelodysplasia.</p><p>Myeloblasts are immature cells with large nuclei, usually with prominent nucleoli, and a variable amount of pale blue cytoplasm (sometimes with faint granulation) after staining with Wright Giemsa. The nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and morphology vary depending upon the maturity of the cell. Auer rods, which are pathognomonic of myeloblasts, vary in frequency depending upon the AML subtype. They can be identified as <span class=\"nowrap\">pink/red</span> rod-like granular structures in the cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78291\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78291 \">picture 3</a>). Sometimes the Auer rods are multiple, and sometimes they form a dense clump and are referred to as &quot;Auer bodies.&quot;</p><p>A myeloperoxidase reaction is easy to perform, can be done in less than a few minutes, and is a simple means of determining if the blasts are myeloid. Absence of a reaction product does not rule out AML, as some cases are negative. Evaluation of myeloperoxidase reactivity must be focused on the blast population and not on mature or maturing myeloid elements on the smear. Some blasts are strongly positive in the reaction, but some can be extremely weak developing only a tiny focus of the reaction product. Some cases can have only a small proportion of the blasts showing the reaction product. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H26565166\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'AML not otherwise specified'</a>.)</p><p>Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood or marrow aspirate can identify circulating myeloblasts in the majority of patients by characteristic patterns of surface antigen expression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62499\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62499 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The specific pattern differs among the AML subtypes, but the majority of cases express CD34, HLA-DR, CD117, CD13, and CD33. Myeloblasts may express T or B cell antigens, most commonly in cytogenetically defined subtypes of AML (eg, CD19 expression in AML with <em>RUNX1-RUNX1T1</em>, CD2 expression in APL) and in acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (mixed phenotype acute leukemia [MPAL]). Care must be taken in interpreting the antigen profile, and in distinguishing AML from ALL or MPAL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In general, the panel of antigens analyzed must contain multiple myeloid, B and T cell markers; the presence of a single B or T cell marker (eg, CD19 or CD7) is insufficient for diagnosing MPAL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Blast count</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy (usually unilateral) is a key component to the diagnosis of AML. The bone marrow is usually hypercellular due to a partial or almost total replacement of the normal cellular components of the marrow by immature or undifferentiated cells, although AML can sometimes present with a hypocellular marrow.</p><p>The bone marrow biopsy gives a general overview of the degree of involvement and specific histologic features associated with the process (eg, fibrosis, necrosis). The aspirate provides material for a 500-cell differential count to determine the percentage of blasts in the marrow; it also provides for detailed cytologic evaluation of the blasts and other cells that may be residual normal hematopoietic elements or abnormal cells maturing from the blasts. The differential count from the aspirate is critical because the blast percentage from the flow specimen may be influenced by hemodilution and artifacts produced by the variability by which the specimen is prepared (eg, red cell lysis techniques, density gradient centrifugation) and the approach through which different cell populations are selected for gating.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Cell origin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The blasts in AML must be identified as cells of the myeloid, monocytic, erythroid, or megakaryocytic lineage and are distinguished from blasts of the lymphoid lineage seen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The non-lymphoid lineage of the AML blasts can be identified by any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of an Auer rod on microscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78291\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78291 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytochemical studies demonstrating positivity for Sudan black B, myeloperoxidase, chloroacetate esterase, or nonspecific esterase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62499\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62499 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow cytometry identifying the expression of myeloid antigens. It is notable that up to 20 percent of acute myeloid leukemias will demonstrate co-expression of lymphoid markers (eg, CD7, CD19, CD2). The outcome after treatment with AML directed therapy is not affected by the co-expression of &quot;lymphoid&quot; antigens. &quot;True&quot; mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is very uncommon and the diagnosis requires co-expression of unambiguous myeloid markers and the presence of lymphoid markers for B lineage.

Although a presumptive diagnosis of AML can be made via examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Occasional patients may have a &quot;dry tap&quot; on aspiration, due to the presence of a hypercellular marrow packed with blasts, or extensive fibrosis. An adequate bone marrow biopsy with touch preparations should provide sufficient material for diagnostic purposes in situations when the marrow cannot be aspirated. A portion of the biopsy can be submitted in saline or preferably culture medium (eg, Roswell Park Memorial Institute culture medium, RPMI) and crushed in the flow cytometry laboratory in an attempt to isolate a blast cell suspension for analysis. Bone marrow necrosis may be seen in highly aggressive AML variants. If excessive necrosis is present, the diagnosis must be made from the findings in the peripheral blood or if inadequate for diagnosis, another bone marrow biopsy site must be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-bone-marrow-aspirate-smears#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of bone marrow aspirate smears&quot;, section on 'Sample preparation'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the presence of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coagulopathy, it is unusual to have bleeding or infection develop at the site of marrow <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/biopsy</span> as a complication of the procedure. The preferred biopsy location in adults is the posterior superior iliac crest and spine, although a different site should be used if the patient has received prior irradiation to this area. The sternum is a reasonable alternative site for bone marrow aspiration, although bone marrow biopsy <strong>cannot</strong> be performed at this site.
