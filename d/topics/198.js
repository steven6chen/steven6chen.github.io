It is characterized by small-vessel platelet-rich thrombi that cause thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and sometimes organ damage. TTP is a medical emergency that is almost always fatal if appropriate treatment is not initiated promptly. With appropriate treatment, survival rates of up to 90 percent are possible.</p><p>TTP can be acquired, due to an autoantibody inhibitor, or hereditary, due to inherited mutations in <em>ADAMTS13</em>.

Primary TMA refers to a TMA for which a specific cause requires specific management. Examples include acquired TTP, hereditary TTP, Shiga toxin-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS), complement-mediated HUS, drug-induced TMA (DITMA), and other rare inherited TMA syndromes. Distinction among these primary TMA syndromes, and other possible causes of MAHA and thrombocytopenia, are discussed in more detail separately.

We no longer use the term &quot;idiopathic TTP&quot; to describe patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, and we prefer to use the terms TTP and HUS to refer to these separate syndromes, rather than the composite term TTP-HUS, which was more useful when specific diagnostic testing and specific therapies were less available. We use the composite term for the Oklahoma registry, which includes any patient referred for plasma exchange (PEX) therapy for a primary TMA syndrome including TTP or HUS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27463029\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of acquired TTP is approximately three cases per one million adults per year, based on data from the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The median age for the diagnosis of acquired TTP diagnosis is 41, with a wide range (9 to 78 years).</p><p>Acquired TTP is very rare in children. By our estimate, the incidence of acquired TTP in children &lt;18 years old is approximately 1 per 10 million per year (ie, approximately 30-fold less common than in adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In children, the possibility of hereditary rather than acquired TTP must be considered.

Acquired TTP may also present in patients with other autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); this may be due to a combination of shared demographic features <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> similar pathophysiology. The typical patient is a young adult, but other populations (eg, children, pregnant women, older adults) can also be affected; when TTP occurs in these populations, the clinical features are similar to those seen in non-pregnant adults.</p><p>Initial symptoms of MAHA and thrombocytopenia may include fatigue, dyspnea, petechiae, or other bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Importantly, however, not all patients with TTP are critically ill. They may walk into the clinician's office with what appear to be minor complaints of weakness and dizziness, abdominal pain, easy bruising, or nausea and vomiting. In some patients, the diagnosis of TTP may not be considered until the complete blood count (CBC) reveals severe thrombocytopenia and MAHA.</p><p>Organ involvement in TTP often affects the central nervous system <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal system. Renal involvement is seen on renal biopsy, but acute kidney injury is uncommon. Other organs such as the heart may also be affected. Pulmonary involvement is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Our review of 78 patients with acquired TTP from the Oklahoma TTP-HUS Registry revealed the following findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57941\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57941 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median platelet count &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> (only three patients [4 percent] had platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;30,000/microL)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median hematocrit &ndash; 21 percent (equivalent to hemoglobin of approximately 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> only two patients [3 percent] had hematocrits &ge;30 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal symptoms &ndash; 45 patients (69 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness &ndash; 41 patients (63 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding or purpura &ndash; 35 patients (54 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major neurologic findings (eg, coma, stroke, seizure, transient focal abnormalities) &ndash; 41 patients (53 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minor neurologic findings (eg, headache, confusion) &ndash; 21 patients (27 percent)</p><p/><p>Importantly, 20 percent had no neurologic symptoms; additionally, high fever with chills, chest pain, and cough were seen in less than one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Chest pain and elevations of serum troponin may occur; however, clinically important cardiac involvement (eg, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia) is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The complete &quot;pentad&quot; of MAHA, thrombocytopenia, fever, acute renal failure, and severe neurologic findings was also rare (&lt;5 percent). Presence of the &quot;pentad&quot; was common before the routine use of therapeutic plasma exchange (PEX) because the majority of patients developed progressive TMA and died from untreated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Therefore, use of the &quot;pentad&quot; for diagnostic purposes has become obsolete.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1144025\"><span class=\"h3\">MAHA and thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia are hallmarks of TTP, and the possibility of TTP should be evaluated in any patient who presents with these findings who does not have an apparent alternative explanation.</p><p>Confirmation of both of these findings requires review of the peripheral blood smear by an experienced clinician. Automated instruments and less experienced individuals may mistake other red blood cell (RBC) abnormalities for microangiopathic changes (eg, anisopoikilocytosis, megaloblastic changes, teardrop cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MAHA</strong> &ndash; MAHA is a hemolytic anemia that results from mechanical shearing (fragmentation) of RBCs as they pass through platelet-rich microthrombi in the microvasculature; it is documented by the finding of prominent schistocytes, including helmet cells and triangular cells, on the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70851\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70851 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Polychromasia (consistent with reticulocytosis) is common. Microspherocytes and nucleated RBCs may also be seen, but microspherocytes are more prominent in patients with warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and many nucleated red cells may suggest a myelophthisic process, such as metastatic malignancy, that may mimic the clinical features of TTP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extracorpuscular-non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-fragmentation-hemolysis-and-hypersplenism#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extracorpuscular non-immune hemolytic anemia: Fragmentation hemolysis and hypersplenism&quot;, section on 'Fragmentation hemolysis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with MAHA typically have other features of hemolytic anemia, elevation of the serum indirect bilirubin concentration, and reduction in the serum haptoglobin concentration. The reticulocyte count is generally increased to compensate for accelerated red cell destruction. The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level is typically extremely high, reflecting both hemolysis and tissue damage due to systemic ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Consistent with the mechanical nature of RBC fragmentation in MAHA, tests for immune hemolysis such as anti-RBC antibodies, including direct and indirect antiglobulin testing (Coombs testing), are negative. Patients may have dark urine from hemoglobinuria because hemolysis is intravascular.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The abundance of schistocytes is variable in acquired TTP and can be affected by the duration of disease and the quality of the blood smear preparation. A finding of two or more schistocytes per high power field (ie, viewed by a 100X magnification oil immersion objective) in the appropriate clinical setting is suggestive of MAHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The quantity of schistocytes in TTP was illustrated in a series of patients with TTP and other disorders typically associated with MAHA, in which schistocytes represented on average 8 percent of RBCs in the patients with TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This percentage was substantially higher than that seen in patients with other disorders associated with MAHA (eg, scleroderma renal crisis and other severe kidney disorders, preeclampsia, mechanical heart valve), all of whom had &lt;0.5 percent schistocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Importantly, however, there is no threshold schistocyte number below which the possibility of TTP can be excluded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of one or two schistocytes in a single field has a very low specificity for TTP. However, more subtle signs of RBC fragmentation may be seen, especially early in disease presentation, and early involvement of the consulting hematologist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematopathologist is encouraged. Rarely, a patient with early TTP may not have schistocytes appreciated; this may occur in a patient in the early stages of relapse who is being followed closely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thrombocytopenia</strong> &ndash; Thrombocytopenia in acquired TTP is thought to result from deposition of platelets in microthrombi; severe thrombocytopenia is common. This was illustrated in a series of 78 patients with TTP, in which the mean platelet count on presentation was <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In contrast, the mean platelet count was <span class=\"nowrap\">43,500/microL</span> in 56 patients with MAHA and thrombocytopenia but ADAMTS13 activity &gt;10 percent. Bleeding is sometimes seen; it may result from a combination of thrombocytopenia, vascular injury, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tissue infarction. In the same series, bleeding, typically petechiae and purpura, was reported in 35 of 65 patients (54 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Major, overt bleeding is very rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The importance of confirming thrombocytopenia on the peripheral blood smear (ie, excluding pseudothrombocytopenia) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Peripheral blood smear'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145369\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurologic and other organ involvement</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic findings</strong> &ndash; Neurologic findings are common in acquired TTP, especially subtle changes such as confusion and headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,14,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14,17-19</a>]. Transient focal neurologic findings such as difficulty speaking or transient numbness and weakness, seizures, and coma also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a series of 78 patients with TTP, minor abnormalities such as confusion or headache were seen in 21 (27 percent); focal abnormalities were seen in 31 (40 percent); and fewer patients had seizure, stroke, or coma (15, 12, and8 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If performed, imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often normal, but they may show changes consistent with reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS, also called posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [PRES]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-posterior-leukoencephalopathy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal symptoms</strong> &ndash; Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in acquired TTP and may include pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. In our series of 65 patients with TTP, these gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common finding, seen in 45 individuals (69 percent). It is important to establish the temporal relationship between diarrhea and other TMA symptoms, if possible. In Shiga toxin-induced TMA, a prodromal gastrointestinal illness with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea generally precedes the development of MAHA and thrombocytopenia by several days.

In the Oklahoma series of patients with TTP, the median serum creatinine was 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (115 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of 78 patients, 37 had normal renal function (47.5 percent), 37 had increased serum creatinine (47.5 percent), and four had acute renal failure (5 percent), which was defined as an increasing serum creatinine (&ge;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> per day for two consecutive days) or a serum creatinine &ge;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Of note, a separate study suggested that acute kidney injury may be common in patients with TTP who are hospitalized in a referral center intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The urinalysis is normal or may show mild proteinuria (eg, 1 to 2 g per day) and few cells or casts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. These findings of mild or no renal insufficiency contrast with other primary TMA syndromes such as Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome, complement-mediated TMA, or immune mediated drug-induced TMA (DITMA; eg, due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a>), in which acute kidney injury with anuria may be common.

In our series of 65 patients with TTP, 14 had chest pain (22 percent). Other series have reported arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,27-32</a>].</p><p/><p>Involvement of other organs, including pancreas, thyroid, adrenal glands, and other organs, may also be seen. Pulmonary involvement is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Tissue biopsy is not required for diagnosis, but if performed, it may show classic changes of a TMA including platelet microthrombi in small arterioles or capillaries, or hyaline changes in and around vessel walls. There are no specific findings on tissue biopsy that distinguish TTP from other primary TMAs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of acquired TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)&quot;, section on 'Histopathology of TMA'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to these findings related to microvascular thrombosis, large-vessel thrombosis such as arterial thromboembolism or venous thromboembolism (VTE) is not a recognized clinical manifestation of TTP. These findings should prompt evaluation for other risk factors for thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduced ADAMTS13 activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severely reduced ADAMTS13 activity (generally &lt;10 percent) during an acute episode is a hallmark of acquired TTP. However, these results are not always immediately available. Regardless of availability, ADAMTS13 activity should not be used in isolation to diagnose TTP or guide initiation or discontinuation of therapy. The use of ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor testing in the diagnostic evaluation are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H91836\" class=\"local\">'ADAMTS13 testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90821\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atypical presentations of TTP are rare but possible. As an example, there have been several reports of patients presenting with neurologic symptoms without MAHA and thrombocytopenia who subsequently (within days to weeks) developed typical clinical features of TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>]. We have seen one young woman who had transient left-sided weakness with a normal CBC, followed four weeks later by transient right-sided weakness with aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

A low score (0 to 4) suggested that ADAMTS13 activity was not &lt;10 percent, with a specificity of approximately 99 percent. Intermediate scores (4 to 5) predicted other disorders such as drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (DITMA), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). A score of 6 to 7 also correlated with improved survival, consistent with the diagnosis of TTP. In an independent validation of the PLASMIC score on a group of 108 consecutive hospitalized patients with suspected TMA, 21 of whom were ultimately diagnosed with TTP, the PLASMIC score had a positive predictive value of 72 percent, a negative predictive value of 98 percent, sensitivity of 90 percent, and specificity of 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

However, as discussed below, activity &lt;10 percent is not 100 percent sensitive or specific for TTP, and laboratory values alone cannot be used to make or exclude the TTP diagnosis. ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent has also been reported in patients with other causes of MAHA and thrombocytopenia including sepsis and systemic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,33,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33,42,43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low activity (between 10 and 60 percent)</strong> &ndash; This finding is seen in many hospitalized patients with inflammatory disorders (eg, sepsis, malignancy).

However, the converse is not always true; ADAMTS13 activity &ge;10 percent does not eliminate the possibility of TTP in individuals with a high confidence in the TTP diagnosis based on clinical features. (See <a href=\"#H90583\" class=\"local\">'Confirmed diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The range of ADAMTS13 activity has been illustrated by several case reports and patient series, which typically show a good correlation between severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and an established diagnosis of TTP, with occasional exceptions.

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of 810 patients in a 2015 series from the United Kingdom (UK) TTP Registry, 350 (43 percent) had ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

The remaining 186 had a median ADAMTS13 activity of 56 percent (range, 42 to 68 percent). Patients in the cohort with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency were less likely to have an alternative cause of MAHA and thrombocytopenia such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), drug-induced TMA, or transplantation, and their disease was more likely to respond to PEX, further supporting the correlation between severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and the clinical diagnosis of acquired TTP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2014 study that compared ADAMTS13 activity in 57 patients with TTP versus 57 patients with other TMAs found that a threshold of &lt;10 percent yielded 100 percent sensitivity and 100 percent specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

The ADAMTS13 activities of these four patients were 10 to 16 percent; three had not been previously transfused.

However, most commercially available assays use an artificial substrate (a VWF peptide) and hence do not actually measure the proteolysis of VWF multimers. Inter-assay agreement continues to improve, but discrepancies among assays persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Additionally, ADAMTS13 activity can be falsely increased by transfusions, which may be given before the possibility of TTP is evaluated. These concerns provide the rationale for our avoidance of basing a TTP diagnosis on ADAMTS13 activity measurements alone. (See <a href=\"#H90576\" class=\"local\">'Presumptive diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with clinically typical TTP and no alternative diagnosis who have ADAMTS13 activity &ge;10 percent, the higher values may be related to measurement methodology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,48</a>]. Examples of factors that contribute to inter-assay variation include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assay method</strong> &ndash; Original assays used gel electrophoresis of VWF multimers to observe their degradation by ADAMTS13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. One of us continues to use this method as one of our assays on all of our patients; however, this assay is not commercially available for most patients. Almost all commercial assays use fluorescence-based detection such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to detect proteolysis of a 73 amino acid peptide from VWF that contains the ADAMTS13 cleavage site. Unlike intact VWF, this peptide does not require extensive denaturation to expose the cleavage site. Exposure of VWF to shear force is thought to expose the cleavage site in vivo; however, the contribution of shear force is especially challenging to measure in a laboratory assay and is not incorporated into standard laboratory testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reference ranges</strong> &ndash; There is no ideal cutoff value above which TTP is eliminated or below which TTP is assured. We have chosen a value of &lt;10 percent as this identifies almost all patients with acquired TTP. However, other experts may use other cutoff values to increase sensitivity or specificity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Interference</strong> &ndash; Some conditions may affect the results in some assays more than others. As examples, high bilirubin levels (eg, &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> may interfere with fluorescence in FRET-based assays, and liver disease may give falsely low ADAMTS13 activity values in several assay types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,51,52</a>]. Reported ADAMTS13 activity can be artificially high if the anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies dissociate from ADAMTS13 during the in vitro incubation required for the assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p>ADAMTS13 activity testing can be performed on plasma or serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Ideally, plasma (or serum) for measuring ADAMTS13 activity is obtained before transfusions are administered or PEX is initiated, so that activity is not increased by these interventions. However, there is value in obtaining a measurement as early as possible after initiation of PEX, if ADAMTS13 activity was not measured prior to the first PEX procedure. The ability to detect severe ADAMTS13 deficiency after initiation of PEX was demonstrated in a study that tested the ADAMTS13 activity in the plasma of 18 patients before and after PEX treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. This showed persistent ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent after the first one or two exchanges in most patients (in 16 of 18 patients [89 percent] after the first exchange, and in 15 of 18 patients [83 percent] after the second exchange).</p><p>ADAMTS13 activity measurements must be interpreted in the clinical context [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As examples, we believe that ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent in patients without MAHA and thrombocytopenia may not indicate an acute episode of TTP and may not be an indication to start PEX. We also believe that ADAMTS13 activity &ge;10 percent in a patient who does have MAHA and thrombocytopenia without another apparent cause should not be used to justify withholding PEX or as a sole rationale for stopping PEX if it has been started based on clinical features. However, other experts have suggested that ADAMTS13 activity &ge;10 percent may be sufficient evidence that a condition other than TTP is responsible for MAHA and thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. We believe some individuals without TTP may have activity &lt;10 percent in some assays, and some individuals with TTP will have activity &ge;10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Additionally, in our experience, some individuals who have recovered from an episode of acquired TTP will have persistently low ADAMTS13 activity, often (but not always) with a demonstrable ADAMTS13 inhibitor, for many years despite being clinically well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Greater accessibility of ADAMTS13 activity measurements (and inhibitor testing (see <a href=\"#H91900\" class=\"local\">'ADAMTS13 inhibitor'</a> below)), along with more rapid return of the results, will help clinicians substantially in making the diagnosis of acquired TTP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Individuals with acquired TTP generally have recovery of ADAMTS13 activity during remission.

Most laboratories reflexively test for an inhibitor in patients with severe deficiency; if this does not occur, testing for an inhibitor should be obtained for patients with severe deficiency.</p><p>Most inhibitor assays use a mixing study, similar in principle to the tests for inhibitors of factor VIII in patients with hemophilia A (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-viii-and-factor-ix-inhibitors-in-patients-with-hemophilia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factor VIII and factor IX inhibitors in patients with hemophilia&quot;</a>). In these assays, patient plasma is mixed with normal plasma, and when an inhibitory autoantibody is present, it inhibits the normal ADAMTS13 activity in the normal plasma. The titer of the inhibitor is determined from the number of serial dilutions of patient plasma after which the inhibitor continues to inhibit ADAMTS13 activity. Inhibitor titers are often presented in Bethesda units (the reciprocal of the dilution required to neutralize 50 percent of the inhibitor).</p><p>It is often assumed that the titer of the inhibitor correlates with clinical outcomes, and that disease in patients with high-titer inhibitors may be more refractory to standard treatment with PEX and glucocorticoids <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more likely to produce an exacerbation when PEX is stopped. However, our experience is that the strength of the ADAMTS13 inhibitor is not related to the severity of the clinical presentation and is not predictive of survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In the United Kingdom (UK) TTP Registry, mixing studies showed the presence of an inhibitor in 78 percent of TTP cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgG antibodies to ADAMTS13 identified a higher percentage (95 percent). However, an inhibitor is not always detected.

However, some individuals with acquired TTP may have higher levels of ADAMTS13 activity, and in some an inhibitor may not be detectable. Diagnosis should not be considered confirmed (or excluded) based on ADAMTS13 testing alone.

Other conditions in the differential diagnosis include causes of anemia and thrombocytopenia associated with red blood cell (RBC) abnormalities on the peripheral blood smear that may appear to be schistocytes to some observers (or to automated counters) but actually are not.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other primary TMAs</strong> &ndash; Several other primary TMAs have been described, including hereditary TTP, drug-induced TMA (DITMA), Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (ST-HUS), complement-mediated HUS, metabolism-mediated TMA, coagulation-mediated TMA, and others. Like acquired TTP, many of these conditions present in adulthood with MAHA and thrombocytopenia, and the spectrum of clinical presentations is broad. Unlike acquired TTP, the other primary TMAs have significant renal failure as a more prominent finding. Unlike acquired TTP, the other primary TMAs (with the exception of hereditary TTP) are not characterized by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (activity &lt;10 percent).

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may mimic the clinical features of TTP, and renal biopsy in SLE may show pathologic features of a TMA. Further complicating the differentiation of SLE from TTP is our observation that SLE was more prevalent in individuals with acquired TTP than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Like acquired TTP, these conditions are associated with MAHA and thrombocytopenia, with or without organ involvement. Like TTP, the pregnancy-associated syndromes are more likely to occur near term, at delivery, or immediately postpartum. Unlike acquired TTP, these conditions do not cause severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, although they may cause low activity (eg, between 10 and 50 percent). Unlike TTP, DIC is associated with alterations in coagulation testing. Unlike TTP, these conditions respond to treatment focused on the underlying condition rather than to plasma exchange therapy. Unlike TTP, the pregnancy-associated syndromes typically resolve following delivery (often within 36 hours).

Examples include kaposiform capillary hemangioendotheliomas (Kasabach-Merritt syndrome), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), and malfunctioning cardiac valves or cardiac assist devices. Unlike acquired TTP, patients with these lesions typically have an obvious source for RBC fragmentation and lack thrombocytopenia.

Like acquired TTP, patients may be acutely ill and have signs of organ infarction and thrombocytopenia. Unlike acquired TTP, patients with HIT have a temporal relationship between the clinical syndrome and heparin exposure; patients with HIT may have venous or arterial thrombosis, whereas TTP causes microvascular thrombosis; and patients with HIT do not have MAHA or severe ADAMTS13 deficiency.

Causes include infections, malignancies (especially hematologic), rheumatologic conditions, and genetic defects in macrophage activation. Children are more frequently affected, but HLH can occur in all age groups. Like TTP, HLH can present as a life-threatening illness with severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neurologic findings. Unlike TTP, patients with HLH often have abnormalities in the bone marrow, very high serum ferritin, and lesions on brain imaging. Unlike TTP, patients with HLH do not have true MAHA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</strong> &ndash; Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which lack of complement regulatory proteins (decay accelerating factor [DAF, CD55] and CD59) leads to hemolytic anemia. Venous thrombosis, including thrombosis in unusual sites such as the portal vein, may ultimately occur in up to 40 percent of individuals. Like TTP, patients have direct antiglobulin test (DAT, Coombs test)-negative hemolytic anemia; there may be other cytopenias including thrombocytopenia; patients may have a variety of nonspecific symptoms; and some may have renal insufficiency. Unlike TTP, when thrombosis occurs in PNH it is seen in large vessels rather than small vessels, and microangiopathic changes are not characteristic of PNH.

Interference with DNA synthesis is usually the mechanism, and common causes include medications used for cancer or autoimmune disorders or deficiencies of vitamin B12, folate, or copper. Like TTP, patients may have Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, markedly increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and thrombocytopenia, and automated counters may flag abnormally shaped RBCs as schistocytes. Like TTP, megaloblastic anemia may be associated with a variety of neurologic findings, especially in the setting of B12 deficiency. Unlike TTP, megaloblastic anemia may also cause leukopenia. The peripheral blood smear in megaloblastic anemia shows macro-ovalocytes rather than schistocytes, and in megaloblastic anemia, a review of medications or diagnostic testing will reveal the cause.

Like acquired TTP, they may present with anemia and thrombocytopenia, and the RBC morphology may be abnormal. Unlike TTP, MDS may be associated with leukopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immature white blood cells in the peripheral blood, and MDS is not associated with true MAHA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evans syndrome</strong> &ndash; Evans syndrome is the combination of warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), often seen in the setting of an underlying autoimmune, infectious, lymphoproliferative, or immunodeficiency syndrome. Like TTP, the patient may present with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Unlike TTP, in Evans syndrome, the direct antiglobulin test (DAT, Coombs test) is positive and there is not true MAHA.

Examples include hyperhemolytic crisis, multiorgan failure, or stroke. Like TTP, patients with SCD and these complications may have severe anemia, an abnormal blood smear, increased LDH, neurologic findings, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal insufficiency. Unlike TTP, patients with these complications of SCD generally do not have thrombocytopenia (although they may) or true MAHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

It occurs in approximately three in one million adults and 1 in 10 million children annually. The incidence is increased in females and blacks. (See <a href=\"#H27463043\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and disease definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27463029\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired TTP usually presents as severe microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia in a previously healthy individual. The typical patient is a young, non-pregnant adult, but children and pregnant women can also be affected. Patients may have symptoms of anemia and thrombocytopenia. However, not all patients are critically ill; some may have only minor complaints of weakness, dizziness, or gastrointestinal symptoms. In some patients, the diagnosis of TTP may not be considered until the complete blood count (CBC) reveals severe thrombocytopenia and MAHA. Neurologic and renal abnormalities may be seen but are not always present; when these occur, they are often mild. (See <a href=\"#H1142524\" class=\"local\">'Overview of presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosing TTP and initiating therapy with plasma exchange (PEX) is urgent. Our general approach is to make a presumptive diagnosis of acquired TTP based on clinical features and initial laboratory testing, which includes a complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count and review of the peripheral blood smear, serum chemistries and creatinine, testing to demonstrate hemolysis, and a negative direct Coombs test. Of note, a presumptive diagnosis of acquired TTP is an indication to initiate therapy with PEX and glucocorticoids, and this potentially life-saving therapy should not be delayed while waiting for the results of confirmatory testing. (See <a href=\"#H10434276\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H90576\" class=\"local\">'Presumptive diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Initiation of PEX for a presumptive diagnosis of TTP'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired TTP is characterized by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (ie, activity &lt;10 percent) and the presence of an inhibitor (autoantibody directed against ADAMTS13). ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor testing is an important adjunct for the clinical diagnosis, but this testing cannot be used in isolation. In many cases, results are not immediately available; results may be altered depending on assay methods and sources of interference (eg, transfusions, PEX, high bilirubin concentration [eg, &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL]),</span> and not all ADAMTS13 inhibitors are demonstrable in available assays. Additionally, patients who have recovered from an episode of acquired TTP may have persistent or intermittent ADAMTS13 deficiency in the absence of symptoms or thrombocytopenia, and therefore ADAMTS13 deficiency may not reflect active disease. In the appropriate clinical setting (eg, a patient with MAHA and thrombocytopenia that responds to PEX), severe ADAMTS13 deficiency with an ADAMTS13 inhibitor confirms the diagnosis of acquired TTP. (See <a href=\"#H91836\" class=\"local\">'ADAMTS13 testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of acquired TTP includes other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) such as hereditary TTP, drug-induced TMA, and complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); other systemic conditions associated with MAHA and thrombocytopenia; disorders associated with mechanical red blood cell fragmentation; and a variety of conditions associated with cytopenias and abnormalities of the peripheral blood smear that could be confused with MAHA.
