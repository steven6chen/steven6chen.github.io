It causes swelling of the glands in front of the ears and above the jaw (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82766\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82766 \">picture 1</a>). These glands are called &quot;parotid&quot; glands.</p><p>Mumps used to be much more common than it is now. Few people get mumps now because most children get a vaccine that helps prevent the infection. It is called the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine combines vaccines for mumps and 2 other infections (measles and rubella) in 1 shot. Doctors recommend that all children get the MMR vaccine as part of their routine childhood vaccines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24836435\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of mumps?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people have no symptoms. But in most people, the early symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired and achy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor appetite</p><p/><p>About 2 days after the early symptoms start, the parotid glands become swollen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24836450\"><span class=\"h1\">How does mumps spread?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have not had mumps or had the MMR vaccine, you can catch mumps just by being around someone who is infected. After you catch the infection, symptoms start in about 14 to 18 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24836467\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I go to the doctor or nurse if I think my child or I have mumps?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Do not go to the doctor or nurse without calling first. Your doctor or nurse might be able to tell you what to do over the phone. That way you will not risk infecting other people at the doctor's office.</p><p>If there is an outbreak of mumps in your community, meaning that a lot of people are coming down with it, call the doctor even if you and your family members have no symptoms. If you haven't gotten the MMR vaccine in the past, your doctor will probably suggest that you get it. Also, some people who already got the vaccine might need to get another dose. This can help lower the risk of getting mumps during an outbreak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24836482\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help your symptoms, your doctor or nurse might recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put heat on the swollen area. Wet a clean wash cloth with warm water and put it on the area. When the wash cloth cools, reheat it with warm water and put it back on. Repeat these steps for 10 to 15 minutes every few hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take over-the-counter medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin). These medicines help ease pain and fever. Adults can also take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> for pain and fever. But <strong>never</strong> give aspirin for fever to a child or teenager who is younger than 18 years old. In children and teens, aspirin can cause a dangerous condition called Reye syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24836497\"><span class=\"h1\">When will I feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with mumps usually get better in about 2 weeks. In rare cases, mumps can cause other problems, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of 1 or both testicles in boys and men</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation of the ovaries in girls and women</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections in and around the brain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deafness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24836512\"><span class=\"h1\">Does the MMR vaccine cause autism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. After doing many careful studies, scientists have not found any link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Many years ago, 1 study said there was a link between autism and vaccines. But that study turned out to be false.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24836529\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=parotitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Parotitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=why-does-my-child-need-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines?
