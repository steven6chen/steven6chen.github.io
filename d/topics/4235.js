Between 25 and 35 percent of injured civilian trauma patients develop a biochemically evident coagulopathy upon arrival in the emergency department, in spite of improved efficiency of trauma systems, military and civilian, in reducing the time interval between acute injury and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Coagulopathy may be the result of physiologic derangements such as acidosis, hypothermia, or hemodilution related to fluid or blood administration; however, an acute coagulopathy can also occur in severely injured patients independent of, or in addition to, these factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Several terms are used in the literature to refer to this condition, including acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), early coagulopathy of trauma (ECT), trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC), and the acute coagulopathy of trauma-shock (ACoTS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/2,3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,6</a>]. </p><p>The etiology, diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathy associated with trauma will be reviewed here. The general principles of shock management in the trauma patient and the treatment of excessive anticoagulation related to medical treatment are discussed elsewhere.

Compared with patients who do not have coagulopathy, those with coagulopathy have a threefold to fourfold greater mortality, and are up to eight times more likely to die within the first 24 hours following injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/2-4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,7,8</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Injury to brain tissue may predispose to acute traumatic coagulopathy and about one-third of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a coagulopathy, although whether TBI-associated coagulopathy is fundamentally different from injury-related coagulopathy is not yet clearly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62326162\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal coagulation is a balance between hemostatic and fibrinolytic processes which permit control of bleeding following mild injury while preventing inappropriate intravascular thrombosis. The etiology of coagulopathy in the injured patient is multifactorial with overlapping contributions depending upon the injury and nature of resuscitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Etiologies that upset this balance include classic elements of the &ldquo;vicious triad&rdquo;: acidosis related to tissue injury and shock, hypothermia from exposure and fluid administration, and hemodilution due to fluid or component blood product administration. Systemic consumption of clotting factors manifesting as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may occur early after injury due to inadequate clotting factor repletion in the face of ongoing consumption, or later in the hospital course triggered by secondary insults (eg, sepsis). Distinct from these, acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) is a biochemical response to injury and shock leading to hyperfibrinolysis and hypocoagulability that appears to be mediated by dysregulation of the Protein C system.</p><p>In addition to the above, release of endothelial-, platelet-, and leukocyte-derived circulating microparticles and injury-associated primary platelet dysfunction have both been identified as contributors to injury-associated coagulopathy, as reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83047596\"><span class=\"h2\">Acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inadequate tissue perfusion in patients with hypovolemic shock due to bleeding leads to metabolic (lactic) acidosis, which can be exacerbated by excessive chloride and component blood administration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acidosis causes demonstrable clotting dysfunction in experimental models at pH&lt;7.2 by interfering with the assembly of coagulation factor complexes involving calcium and negatively-charged phospholipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. As an example, the activity of the factor <span class=\"nowrap\">Xa/Va/phospholipid/prothrombin</span> (&ldquo;prothrombinase&rdquo;) complex is reduced by 50, 70, and 90 percent at a pH of 7.2, 7.0, and 6.8, respectively. However, correction of acidosis alone does not always correct the associated coagulopathy, indicating that tissue injury causes coagulopathy via additional mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H299161\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypothermia in injured patients is graded into mild (36 to 34&deg;C), moderate (34 to 32&deg;C), and severe (&lt;32&deg;C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Nearly two-thirds of trauma patients have a temperature below 36&deg;C on presentation; 9 percent of trauma patients have a temperature at or below 33&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/14,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19-22</a>].</p><p>Hypothermia following injury is due to cold exposure at the time of injury, during transport, and during the trauma examination compounded by the administration of cold intravenous fluids. Patients who require surgery are at a greater risk for hypothermia due to further physical exposure in the operating room, additional fluid administration, and the effects of general anesthesia. Injured patients with hypothermia generally have worse outcomes compared with noninjured patients with hypothermia; however, hypothermia alone is a weak independent predictor of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23</a>]. Acidosis and hypothermia are synergistic with increased mortality when both are present, compared with either alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>The effect of hypothermia on clotting includes platelet dysfunction and impaired enzymatic function. Overall thrombin generation in activated in vitro clotting systems is generally preserved at a temperature of 33&deg;C; however, impairment of tissue factor activity, platelet aggregation, and platelet adhesion are evident at temperatures between 33 to 37&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>]. It is important to note that no effects on coagulation tests (either standard or viscoelastic) are seen in hypothermia-induced coagulopathy without special sample handling due to the standard practice of pre-warming blood samples to 37&deg;C prior to analysis, which corrects the defect. In other words, the result of coagulation testing reflects clotting characteristics that the patient would have if their temperature were 37&deg;C.</p><p>Specific measures to correct hypothermia include controlling physical exposure, the administration of warmed fluids, and passive rewarming with blankets and forced-air devices. Rapid identification and control of bleeding is vital to preserve normal temperature. Continuous temperature monitoring is essential to ensure that mild hypothermia does not worsen. In the case of moderate or severe hypothermia and coagulopathy, central rewarming may be needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H299168\"><span class=\"h2\">Resuscitation-associated (dilutional) coagulopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resuscitation-associated coagulopathy (RAC), also now termed iatrogenic coagulopathy, refers to alterations of the coagulation system induced by large volumes of intravenous fluids or unbalanced component blood administration during the management of shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Trauma resuscitation historically focused on the treatment of hypotension and acidosis with aggressive crystalloid resuscitation followed by packed red blood cells (PRBC). At that time, treatment of coagulopathy was initiated only in response to abnormal standard coagulation tests. Similarly, platelet transfusion was generally not performed until laboratory evidence of thrombocytopenia was present.</p><p>Computer modeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], in vitro experiments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and clinical studies in healthy volunteers have found that large volume resuscitation with crystalloid, colloid, and packed red blood cells leads to dilution of plasma clotting proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A retrospective study of 8724 injured patients from the German Trauma Registry found a positive correlation between prehospital fluid resuscitation volume and coagulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Coagulopathy was present on admission in more than 50 percent of patients who received &gt;3 L of intravenous fluid prior to arrival, but coagulopathy was also present in 10 percent of patients administered &lt;500 mL and in 32 patients who had received no prehospital fluids, which appears to reflect the frequently overlapping contribution of acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC). (See <a href=\"#H122599087\" class=\"local\">'Acute traumatic coagulopathy'</a> below.)</p><p>Another factor contributing to resuscitation associated coagulopathy is the effect of storage time on packed red blood cells which undergo progressive functional and structural changes over time. The &lsquo;storage lesion&rsquo; includes decreased pH, chelation of calcium, low 2,3 diphosphoglycerate levels, and decreased clotting factor concentration. Transfusion of older blood can further impair microvascular perfusion, and has inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, specialized modifications, and infusion parameters&quot;, section on 'Effect of storage conditions on transfusion outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>The median duration of storage of a unit of red blood cells in the United States is about 15 days, which is relatively old, with even older units frequently allocated to high-use facilities such as trauma centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus, the storage lesion is particularly relevant for massively transfused trauma patients. Although several observational studies had suggested that an older storage age of transfused PRBCs may be linked to higher morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], two later trials of shorter- versus longer-stored blood in cardiac surgical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], and critically ill adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], did not confirm a difference in outcomes associated with longer-stored blood product transfusion. The relevance of these findings in trauma patients has not yet been specifically investigated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83047881\"><span class=\"h2\">Disseminated intravascular coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic process producing consumptive coagulopathy in concert with diffuse microvascular thrombosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63831\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63831 \">table 1</a>). In trauma patients, tissue-injury-induced exposure of tissue factor and activation of the extrinsic coagulation cascade leads to thrombin generation proportional to injury severity. In addition, systemic embolism of tissue-specific thromboplastins from sites of injury (including bone marrow lipid material, amniotic fluid, and brain phospholipids) may predispose patients to DIC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The risk of ATC increases with hypotension, higher injury severity scores, worsening base deficit, and head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>]. Once established, ATC is often compounded by other etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H83047596\" class=\"local\">'Acidosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H299161\" class=\"local\">'Hypothermia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H299168\" class=\"local\">'Resuscitation-associated (dilutional) coagulopathy'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with ATC frequently meet criteria for DIC and some authors have argued that acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) may represent an early, partially-compensated stage of DIC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/25,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,38,39</a>]. However, the concept of DIC as a final common pathway for several different phenomena is insufficient to explain the hematologic abnormalities post-injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/7,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,40,41</a>]. Coagulopathy in the absence of thrombocytopenia and hypofibrinogenemia, as seen in ATC, argues against consumption as a necessary underlying mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] Although D-dimer levels are frequently elevated and fibrinogen levels depleted in acutely injured patients, indicating intravascular fibrin deposition and active fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], functional thrombin generation (assayed by the presence of prothrombin fragments and thrombin-antithrombin complexes) remains intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/7,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,43-45</a>]. Furthermore, ATC occurs only when tissue injury is combined with systemic hypoperfusion. Thus, it is most likely that ATC is mechanistically distinct from DIC but that these frequently overlap. Exploring this distinction is an area of ongoing research. (See <a href=\"#H83047881\" class=\"local\">'Disseminated intravascular coagulation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3046566840\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A prospective study of injured patients with blunt trauma and hemorrhagic shock enrolled in the Host Response to Injury Large-Scale Collaborative Program attempted to characterize the relative contributions of multiple risk factors to coagulopathy in 578 of the 1537 patients (37.6 percent). In this study, more than 80 percent of patients with coagulopathy on arrival had risk factors related to elements of the classic vicious triad (see <a href=\"#H83047596\" class=\"local\">'Acidosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H299161\" class=\"local\">'Hypothermia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H299168\" class=\"local\">'Resuscitation-associated (dilutional) coagulopathy'</a> above) as well as to ATC (see <a href=\"#H18982251\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism'</a> below). The authors found that, even when adjusting for all of these risk factors in multivariate analysis, arrival coagulopathy remained an independent predictor of multiorgan failure and mortality, implying that additional biochemical factors driving coagulopathy remain to be discovered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18982251\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial observations in hypoperfused trauma patients found a correlation between acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC) and elevated levels of activated protein C (aPC), reduced levels of non-activated protein C, and elevated soluble thrombomodulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Activation of the thrombomodulin-protein C system is a principle pathway mediating ATC, a mechanism that is distinct from clotting factor consumption or dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/7,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,47</a>]. </p><p>Under normal circumstances, tissue injury leads to thrombin generation, fibrin deposition, and clot formation via the extrinsic pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75450\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75450 \">figure 1</a>). The enzymatic pathways making up the coagulation cascade are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Initiation of the clotting process is localized to the site of tissue injury. Systemic coagulation due to the escape of thrombin from the injury site is inhibited by circulating antithrombin III, or by the binding of thrombin to constitutively-expressed thrombomodulin on nearby undamaged endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>Protein C, a systemic anticoagulant, is proteolytically converted from an inactive zymogen to activated protein C (aPC) by the complex of thrombin with thrombomodulin. Activated protein C is a serine protease that proteolytically inactivates factors Va and VIIIa and depletes plasminogen inhibitors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81428\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81428 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70156\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70156 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/47,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49</a>]. In this manner, aPC can serve a protective function by inhibiting thrombosis during periods of decreased flow. </p><p>Sustained hypoperfusion is associated with increased circulating soluble thrombomodulin levels, which can increase the availability of thrombomodulin-bound thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, thrombin can be diverted from a predominantly procoagulant role to a pathologic, anticoagulant role via excess activation of protein C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although the precise biochemical mechanisms are still under investigation, the importance of protein C in this process has been confirmed. Inhibition of protein C by an antibody-mediated mechanism in an animal model has been shown to prevent the development of ATC in response to trauma and hemorrhagic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>With widespread protein C activation, thrombin generation is inhibited, impairing clot formation, and fibrinolysis is enhanced causing degradation of existing clot. Consumption of endogenous plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by ATC-mediated aPC destabilizes the fibrinolytic balance, leading to uninhibited tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated conversion of plasminogen to plasmin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Diversion of thrombin to protein C activation may also reduce activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), further enhancing fibrinolytic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. These mechanisms lead to the hyperfibrinolytic state seen in trauma patients with ATC, which is reflected in increased levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), decreased plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and increased D-dimer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Activated protein C also has antiinflammatory and cytoprotective effects. Profound activation and consumption of protein C can deplete protein C stores, potentially leading to infectious and later thrombotic sequelae. These effects are mediated via binding of aPC to a protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) that are likely independent of the role of aPC as an anticoagulant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The importance of these mechanisms is suggested by separate murine models in trauma and sepsis. In these experiments, selective antibody-mediated inhibition of the anticoagulant function of aPC reduced the rate of coagulopathy, but not mortality, while inhibition of anticoagulant and cytoprotective functions increased mortality after a challenge with <span class=\"nowrap\">trauma/hemorrhagic</span> shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], or injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>These animal model results are supported by two large prospective human studies of clotting factor levels after injury:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-center study of 203 critically-injured trauma patients, early coagulopathy was linked to high levels of activated protein C, and later, protein C depletion as early as six hours after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Ongoing studies are evaluating the interactions of the protein C system, innate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>] and cellular immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>], and endothelial activation and barrier permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/58,64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,64-66</a>]. </p><p>The recently identified importance of ATC-associated depletion of protein C stores after traumatic injury suggests a potential mechanism for later hypercoagulability and risk of thromboembolic complications after trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/54,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,67,68</a>]. Although this phenomenon has not been studied in the trauma population, a prothrombotic state associated with protein C depletion has been reported in septic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

One prospective observational study of 180 trauma patients identified elevated levels of endothelial-, erythrocyte-, and leukocyte-derived microparticles in the circulation of traumatically injured patients compared with 65 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

Platelet count at the time of admission has been noted to be inversely correlated with transfusion and early mortality in injured patients, even for platelet counts well in the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Such quantitative platelet defects also correlate with progression of intracranial hemorrhage and mortality after traumatic brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Several descriptive studies have also noted qualitative platelet dysfunction in trauma patients, reflecting functional platelet impairment that is independent of platelet count.

Additionally, the results from standard laboratory analysis can take up to 30 minutes and may not accurately reflect the patient&rsquo;s evolving coagulation status; the delay in the availability of results may make them irrelevant in the face of exsanguinating hemorrhage. As a result, there has been a trend toward the use of point-of-care laboratory testing (thromboelastography) and clinical scoring systems to guide management of the severely injured patient.

This lower INR value may be a more appropriate cutoff for patients with more severe injury (injury severity scale [ISS]&gt;15) and shock. </p><p/><p>Decreased platelet count and decreased platelet function also contribute to coagulopathy and poor outcome following trauma (see <a href=\"#H186664966\" class=\"local\">'Emerging effectors of coagulopathy'</a> above), although little information about platelet function is evident from the platelet count alone. Thromboelastography, a holistic assessment of clot formation, reflects the contribution of platelet count and function to coagulation, and may be modified to investigate platelet function specifically (see <a href=\"#H3046566855\" class=\"local\">'Thromboelastography'</a> below). Other instrumentation available to specifically assess platelet function includes the platelet function analyzer (PFA-100), and the electrical impedance whole blood aggregometer (Multiplate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>].

The initial transfusion (4 units of packed red blood cells, 2 units of plasma) was triggered by activation of the massive transfusion protocol (at the treating clinician&rsquo;s discretion) while awaiting results of coagulation tests (standard or thromboelastography). Subsequent transfusions were guided by the assigned coagulation testing. There were no significant differences in injury severity score (ISS) between the groups. The risk of death was significantly higher for the conventional group compared with the thromboelastography group (hazard ratio 2.17, 95% CI 1.03-4.6). Just over half of the deaths <span class=\"nowrap\">(16/31)</span> occurred within six hours of arrival in the emergency department. Death rates in the conventional versus thromboelastography groups were <span class=\"nowrap\">12/55</span> (21.8 percent) versus <span class=\"nowrap\">4/56</span> (7.1 percent) at 6 hours, and <span class=\"nowrap\">20/55</span> (36.4 percent) versus <span class=\"nowrap\">11/56</span> (19.6 percent) at 28 days. These outcomes may be due to differences in the timing of transfusion and ratio of blood products given. Although there were no differences in the overall volume of transfusion at 24 hours, the standard assay group received more plasma and platelets during the first several hours of resuscitation. Where thromboelastography is available, we suggest thromboelastography-based goal-directed resuscitation for trauma patients&nbsp;requiring massive transfusion. Standard coagulation assays may be performed in parallel to facilitate communication with practitioners unfamiliar with thromboelastography parameters. At centers where thromboelastography is unavailable, empiric plasma-forward transfusion strategies guided by standard coagulation assays remains standard of care.</p><p>An example protocol from Denver Health Medical Center, providing normal ranges and transfusion cutoffs, is given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56058\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56058 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coagulopathy-associated-with-trauma/abstract/127,131\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,131</a>].

In severely injured patients, an additional biochemical process that remains incompletely characterized underlies &lsquo;acute traumatic coagulopathy&rsquo;. Consumption of clotting factors manifesting as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may contribute upon presentation or later in the hospital course.

Acute traumatic coagulopathy is mediated primarily by activation of the thrombomodulin-protein C system. (See <a href=\"#H122599087\" class=\"local\">'Acute traumatic coagulopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard coagulation tests including prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/international</span> normalized ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(PT/INR),</span> activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen level, and platelet count are part of the initial laboratory evaluation of trauma patients. In patients without pre-existing coagulation defects, a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) greater than 1.5 times normal on admission defines the presence of acute traumatic coagulopathy. Clinically relevant ATC can occur in patients who have normal platelet and fibrinogen levels.

Thromboelastography measures the viscoelastic properties of clot formation providing information on clot initiation, clot strength, and fibrinolysis. For patients requiring massive transfusion, we suggest thromboelastography-based goal-directed resuscitation rather than transfusion based on standard coagulation assays, when the technology is available (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). At centers where thromboelastography is not available, empiric plasma-forward transfusion strategies guided by standard coagulation assays remains standard of care.

Injured patients with acute traumatic coagulopathy are more likely to require massive transfusion and benefit from early matched transfusion.
