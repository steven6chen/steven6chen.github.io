Viral hepatitis, for example, is probably the most common liver disease in pregnancy. However, some of these disorders, such as hepatitis E, can have a fulminant course in the pregnant woman. In addition, the physiologic changes associated with pregnancy may predispose to hepatobiliary diseases, particularly cholelithiasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE VIRAL HEPATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute viral hepatitis can complicate pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although vaccination may prevent acute infection with hepatitis A and hepatitis B, a large pool of unvaccinated, nonimmune women worldwide remains at risk for developing these diseases during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of hepatitis A during pregnancy is generally similar to that in nonpregnant patients. The disease tends to be more severe with increasing age in all patients, while severe illness during the third trimester may be associated with an increased risk for premature labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Treatment in pregnancy consists of rest and a balanced diet.</p><p>However, gestational complications may be common. In a review of almost 80,000 pregnancies, 13 cases of acute hepatitis A during the second and third trimester were detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of these, 69 percent developed gestational complications including premature contractions, placental separation, premature rupture of the membranes, and vaginal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Eight patients developed preterm labor at a median of 34 weeks gestational age. Despite these occurrences, all children had favorable outcomes. Perinatal transmission of the virus has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute infection with hepatitis B during pregnancy is not associated with increased maternal or fetal mortality or teratogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Thus, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection during gestation should not prompt consideration of termination of the pregnancy. Pregnant women should be checked for seroclearance versus persistence of the HBV infection to determine risk for vertical transmission. Newborns of mothers with persistent infection should undergo immunization with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> and HBV vaccine and have close follow up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy#H1333645997\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Acute Hepatitis B virus infection'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis E</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis E virus infection occurs both in epidemics and sporadically in many parts of the developing world, including Pakistan, Northern Africa, and Mexico (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-e-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis E virus infection&quot;</a>). Women in their third trimester of pregnancy are predisposed to severe clinical disease and may develop fulminant hepatitis with a case fatality as high as 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Pregnant women with jaundice and acute viral hepatitis caused by hepatitis E virus infection appear to have worse obstetric and fetal outcomes compared with pregnant women with jaundice and acute viral hepatitis due to other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Because of this risk, such women should carefully consider the risk of travel to endemic areas.</p><p>Fulminant hepatitis due to hepatitis E may resemble liver failure from acute fatty liver of pregnancy; hepatic infarction in the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP); or herpes simplex hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Hepatitis E should be considered in pregnant women who develop acute hepatitis, especially in endemic areas. Epidemiologic data suggest that hepatitis E virus is also present in industrialized countries and may be responsible for some cases of sporadic hepatitis E in the United States and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although the diagnosis can sometimes be confirmed by serologic testing, only research-based tests are available for the specific detection of hepatitis E virus RNA in the serum or stool. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-e-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis E virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hepatitis E can cause acute hepatitis in the newborn and may be transmitted in utero to the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Herpes simplex hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatitis due to primary systemic infection with herpes simplex virus may be severe when occurring during pregnancy, and cases of fulminant herpetic hepatitis have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Affected patients may have a prodrome of fever and upper respiratory tract symptoms. Despite marked abnormalities in serum aminotransferases and the prothrombin time, they are usually anicteric at presentation.</p><p>A vesicular eruption, if present, should suggest the diagnosis. Culture of the vesicular fluid, serologic testing, and liver histology help to distinguish herpetic hepatitis from other severe liver disorders associated with pregnancy, such as acute fatty liver of pregnancy and preeclamptic liver disease. In contrast to those diseases, delivery is usually unnecessary and therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other viruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenoviruses can cause hepatitis in association with systemic infection, which are usually self-limited, requiring only supportive care. However, transmission to the fetus can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">BILIARY TRACT DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Gallstones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy decreases gallbladder motility and increases the lithogenicity of bile. Epidemiologic studies have shown that pregnancy is associated with an increased risk for gallstones. The risk remains elevated for five years following pregnancy and then returns to baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Gallstone disease in pregnant women is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallstones-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallstones in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute pancreatitis is a rare complication of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Approximately two-thirds of cases are biliary in origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]; such cases are associated with better outcomes than nonbiliary causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallstones-in-pregnancy#H216896\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallstones in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Gallstone pancreatitis'</a>.)</p><p>In selected patients, diagnoses other than gallstone pancreatitis should be considered. In rare cases, pancreatitis during pregnancy is associated with acute fatty liver of pregnancy, preeclampsia, hyperemesis gravidarum, and familial hypertriglyceridemia, which may be exacerbated by the physiologic hypertriglyceridemia of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Choledochal cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A choledochal cyst can present during pregnancy. Changes in biliary motility associated with pregnancy may lead to the development of symptoms in previously asymptomatic patients who have a congenital choledochal cyst. Symptomatic patients present with abdominal pain, a right upper quadrant mass, and jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Spontaneous rupture of a choledochal cyst is a rare complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Spontaneous rupture of an apparently normal common bile duct is another rare complication of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">BUDD-CHIARI SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly 20 percent of cases of the Budd-Chiari syndrome (hepatic venous outflow obstruction) occur in women who have been on oral contraceptives (for as little as two weeks), are pregnant, or have delivered a child within the previous two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It is presumed that the hypercoagulable state in these women is responsible for this association (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>). Furthermore, pregnancy may exacerbate other hypercoagulable states that predispose to the Budd-Chiari syndrome such as the antiphospholipid syndrome, factor V Leiden and protein S deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Thus, an underlying cause of hypercoagulability other than pregnancy should be sought in all patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-the-budd-chiari-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of the Budd-Chiari syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Successful pregnancy has been described in women with known or treated Budd-Chiari syndrome, but there are substantial risks. One of the largest series included 16 women with Budd-Chiari syndrome who had been treated with surgical and radiologic approaches and anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Of 24 pregnancies, 7 were lost before week 20. Two patients delivered between week 20 and 31, 11 between weeks 32 and 36, and four after week 37. There was one stillbirth. Patients with a factor II gene mutation had poor pregnancy outcomes. Two patients developed symptomatic thrombosis during pregnancy or postpartum. Clinically significant bleeding (although not fatal) was observed at delivery in patients on anticoagulation. Multidisciplinary care is usually required in these patients, including the involvement of a hepatologist, hematologist, obstetrician, and maternal-fetal medicine specialist.</p><p>Other reports have also documented survival and delivery with conservative measures and anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Liver transplantation has been used as a lifesaving measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Recurrence during a subsequent pregnancy has been reported in a patient whose anticoagulants were discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG-INDUCED HEPATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of concern about teratogenicity in the fetus, pregnant women generally take fewer medications than nonpregnant women. Pregnancy is not associated with an increased susceptibility to drug toxicity. However, hepatotoxicity due to drugs may occur during pregnancy and should be considered in patients with abnormal liver biochemical tests associated with prescription (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyldopa</a>) or nonprescription medications, including herbal compounds. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatotoxicity-due-to-herbal-medications-and-dietary-supplements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatotoxicity due to herbal medications and dietary supplements&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SEPSIS-ASSOCIATED CHOLESTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sepsis, particularly originating from the urinary tract, can lead to cholestasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Furthermore, urinary tract infections may be associated with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. As a result, urinary tract infections should be systematically sought and treated in patients who develop cholestasis during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATIC METASTASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver is not palpable during normal pregnancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-liver-disease-occurring-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to liver disease occurring during pregnancy&quot;</a>). Thus, the detection of hepatomegaly on physical examination is an abnormal finding. Carcinoma metastatic to the liver can occur during pregnancy from primary lesions in the colon, pancreas, and breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intercurrent-hepatobiliary-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. It is possible that the modest immunosuppressive state associated with pregnancy permits enhanced growth of tumors in this setting. Women with extensive tumor invasion of the liver may present with abdominal or back pain, rupture of the liver, or hepatic failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three possible etiologic relationships of liver disease during pregnancy: the liver disease was induced by the pregnancy (eg, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, hyperemesis gravidarum), it existed before pregnancy (eg, chronic liver disease such as chronic viral hepatitis), or it developed during pregnancy (eg, acute viral hepatitis, Budd-Chiari syndrome).
