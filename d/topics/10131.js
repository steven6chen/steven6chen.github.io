The spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that runs from the base of the brain down the back. Both the brain and spinal cord are surrounded by fluid called &quot;cerebrospinal fluid.&quot; This fluid, also called &quot;CSF,&quot; cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord. This fluid can hold important clues about the health of the brain and spinal cord. It can show, for example, if there is infection or bleeding in the brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14930885\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor order an LP?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might order an LP to check for problems that affect the brain or spinal cord. Some examples of these problems include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection that affects the brain or spinal cord, such as meningitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding in a part of your head called the &quot;subarachnoid space&quot; &ndash; This is the area between your brain and the thin layer of tissue that covers it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61435\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61435 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called multiple sclerosis, which causes vision problems, numbness and tingling, muscle weakness, and other problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer that has spread to the tissues surrounding the brain or spinal cord</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve problems such as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, a condition that causes muscle weakness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called &quot;pseudotumor cerebri&quot; which can cause pressure inside the skull</p><p/><p>Doctors sometimes also do LPs to give certain types of medicines directly into the area surrounding the spinal cord. Examples of medicines that might be given this way include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthesia (to block pain, for example during childbirth or surgery)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer-fighting medicines (called chemotherapy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14930929\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during an LP?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To get you ready for the LP, the doctor will probably ask you to lie on your side and hug your legs, so that your back is curved in a &quot;C&quot; shape. During the procedure, it is very important that you stay very still. Tell your doctor if you are uncomfortable or do not think you can stay still in the position he or she asks you to stay in.</p><p>After you are in the right position, the doctor will clean the area around your lower back. He or she might also give you a shot to numb your lower back. Then the doctor will insert a needle into your back, between two of the bones (called &quot;vertebrae&quot;) that make up the spine. The needle will go straight through your skin and the tissues that surround the spinal cord into the space that is filled with fluid. The procedure is done in the lower part of the back below the point where the spinal cord ends (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87112\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87112 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>After the needle is in place, the doctor will measure the fluid pressure. He or she will also collect a small sample of fluid, or inject medicine if needed. This generally takes several minutes.</p><p>After the doing the LP, your doctor might ask you to stay lying down for a half-hour or more, before you get up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14930963\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the downsides of having an LP?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After having an LP, people can sometimes get a bad headache. This happens because the spot where the LP needle goes in does not always close up right away. If the hole stays open, CSF can leak out, causing a headache.</p><p>In most cases, the hole closes up on its own and the headache goes away in 1 to 2 days. If you get a headache after having an LP, you can take pain medicines to deal with it. The headache will also probably feel much better if you lie down. If your headache does not get better after 1 or 2 days, your doctors can offer you a treatment called a &quot;blood patch.&quot; This involves taking a small amount of blood and injecting it into the area where the LP was taken. The blood fills in the hole and CSF levels go back to normal, so the headache goes away.</p><p>Rare problems caused by LP can include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding &ndash; Before having an LP, tell your doctor if you take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> (brand name: Coumadin) or any other type of medicine that is used to &quot;thin&quot; the blood or prevent blood clots. These medicines could increase your risk of bleeding during the procedure. It's important for the doctor to know if you take them. He or she will also test your blood to make sure it clots normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A life-threatening problem with the brain called &quot;cerebral herniation&quot; &ndash; This problem is very rare and usually happens only to people who already have a life-threatening brain condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or numbness in the back or legs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal growths (called &quot;epidermoid tumors&quot;) that form on the spine long after the LP is done &ndash; These is more likely to happen in children than adults.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14930980\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child needs an LP?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LPs in children are very similar to LPs in adults, but children often must be given medicines to make them go to sleep before they have an LP. That's because children usually can't stay still the way they need to for an LP to be done the right way.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14930995\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bacterial meningitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-meningitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Viral meningitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hydrocephalus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=subarachnoid-hemorrhage-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningitis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Meningitis in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
