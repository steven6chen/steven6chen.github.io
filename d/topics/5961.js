Women who have had recent unprotected intercourse, including those who have had a failure of another method of contraception, are potential candidates for this intervention. It is intended for occasional or back-up use, not as a primary contraceptive method for routine use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Health professionals should inform women about use of emergency contraception and the available options. This discussion should include the advantages and disadvantages of each method, including efficacy and side effects. Males should also be aware of emergency contraception as a method of preventing pregnancy in their partners. In the United States, one in nine reproductive aged women used emergency contraception at least once between 2006 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, candidates for emergency contraception are women who have had recent unprotected intercourse (including sexual assault), or who have had a recent possible failure of another method of contraception, and who do not desire pregnancy. A detailed list of potential indications is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51098\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51098 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct laboratory evidence overwhelmingly supports the hypothesis that oral emergency contraceptives work primarily by delaying ovulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Copper intrauterine contraception inhibits fertilization by affecting sperm viability and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The copper device also has postfertilization contraceptive effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both oral and intrauterine emergency contraceptives are only effective before a pregnancy has implanted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These treatments are ineffective once implantation has occurred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY AND RISK FACTORS FOR FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall risk of pregnancy after an episode of coitus without effective contraception is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58851 \">table 2</a>). These data represent the rate of pregnancy in a population of young couples in their mid-20s. Although conception is possible on only a few days of the cycle, emergency contraception is offered, when indicated, without regard to timing of the menstrual cycle due to uncertainty in timing of ovulation. Results of efficacy studies need to be interpreted within this context, but have generally found that the copper intrauterine contraception (IUD) is the most effective emergency contraceptive option (failure rate 0.04 to 0.19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], followed by mid-dose (25 to 50 mg) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> acetate (failure rate approximately 1.4 percent) and then <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> (failure rate 2 to 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Looked at in another way, when used within 72 hours of intercourse it is estimated that the copper IUD prevents over 95 percent of expected pregnancies, ulipristal acetate prevents two-thirds of expected pregnancies, and levonorgestrel prevents around 50 percent of pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>A 2011 meta-analysis including 3445 women who used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> for emergency contraception found three variables influenced the risk of pregnancy after using emergency contraception: body mass index (BMI), conception probability based on day of cycle, and further intercourse after emergency contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared to normal weight or underweight women taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> emergency contraception, obese women (BMI &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> who took levonorgestrel for emergency contraception were at four-fold higher risk of pregnancy (OR 4.41; 95% CI 2.05-9.44) and overweight women (BMI 25 to 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> were at two-fold higher risk of pregnancy (OR 2.09; 95% CI 0.86&ndash;4.87). In fact, for overweight and obese women, levonorgestrel use was not associated with a significant reduction in pregnancy rate compared with that expected with no medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a>, obese women were at two-fold higher risk of pregnancy (OR 2.62, 95% CI 0.89-7.00) and overweight women appeared to have no increase in risk (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.27&ndash;2.83) compared to normal or underweight women using ulipristal for emergency contraception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the included trials were not designed to assess the role of body mass index or weight in efficacy of emergency contraception. Confidence limits were wide and there were few women, and very few pregnancies, at BMI <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;35kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women using emergency contraception, the risk of pregnancy associated with unprotected intercourse was four-fold higher during the period of highest probability of conception (intercourse on the day before ovulation when conception probability is 30 percent) compared with intercourse when the risk of conception was theoretically nil (ie, intercourse more than five days before ovulation or more than one day after ovulation) (pregnancy rate 2.9 versus 1.1 percent; OR 4.42, 95% CI 2.33-8.20).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further acts of unprotected intercourse after using emergency contraception were associated with a four-fold increase in pregnancy compared with women who did not report further intercourse (pregnancy rate 6.4 versus 1.5 percent; OR 4.64, 95% CI 2.22-8.96).</p><p/><p>Systematic reviews have concluded that easier access to emergency contraception led to higher utilization, but did not result in a significant drop in the pregnancy rate of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Some limitations of study design may account for these null findings (eg, low power, inadequate provision of emergency contraceptives after the first or second dose). However, inconsistent use of emergency contraception and overestimation of the efficacy of emergency contraception are other possible explanations. An important observation is that these data did not identify any harm from making emergency contraception readily available or any increase in risky sexual behaviors (eg, unprotected intercourse) or acquisition of sexually transmitted disease. Furthermore, given the proven efficacy of the method, it is reasonable to assume that some unplanned pregnancies were prevented in women who used emergency contraception, thus benefiting these individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several options are available for emergency contraception (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F70383\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70383 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/9,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18</a>]. Intrauterine contraception is the most effective method of emergency contraceptive and has the advantage of providing ongoing highly effective contraception, but requires an office visit for insertion within days of the episode of unprotected sex (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> below). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ulipristal</a> is the most effective oral method, especially 72 to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse, but requires a prescription. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Levonorgestrel</a> alone is less effective than ulipristal, but is available over-the-counter. Levonorgestrel is more effective than the combination of estradiol plus levonorgestrel (Yuzpe regimen) and has a lower frequency of side effects (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2658873687\"><span class=\"h2\">Copper intrauterine contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Copper intrauterine contraception (IUD) is the most effective method of emergency contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Advantages of this method are that it provides continuing contraception after initial IUD placement, is more effective than oral regimens, especially in <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obese</span> women, and is well tolerated, with one-year continuation rates of 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/11,14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,21</a>]. Based on the high continuation rate of a highly effective contraceptive method, copper IUDs are also highly cost effective when used for emergency contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Women should be informed that this is the most effective emergency contraception available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; however, use of the copper IUD for emergency contraception is off-label in the United States.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one multicenter study including 1013 women requesting emergency contraception, the pregnancy rate with IUD insertion within 120 hours after unprotected intercourse was 0.20 per 100 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Taking into account the probability of pregnancy on each cycle day, the total number of expected pregnancies was 56.8 while the number of observed pregnancies was 2, thus the overall efficacy of preventing pregnancy was 96.9 percent (98.1 and 92.4 percent in the parous and nulliparous groups, respectively). In addition, 86 percent of parous women and 80 percent of nulliparous women who used an IUD for emergency contraception continued with the IUD for contraception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study of 1963 women receiving the copper T380 A up to five days after unprotected intercourse reported no pregnancies (ie, it was 100 percent effective) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The 12-month probability of continuation was 94 percent.</p><p/><p>Intrauterine contraception should be avoided in women known to have current gonorrhea or chlamydial infection or found to have acute cervicitis during examination because of the increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In the absence of other medical contraindications, there is no contraindication to inserting the IUD on the same day that the patient presents for emergency contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Insertion and removal&quot;, section on 'Timing of insertion and pregnancy testing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Insertion and removal&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p>Placement of a copper IUD for emergency contraception is often performed in family planning clinics and practices that place IUDs routinely, but other settings may find it difficult to accommodate patients within the required window (within five to seven days of unprotected intercourse (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> below)). Among 158,000 women requesting emergency contraception in the United Kingdom in 2006-2007, 3 percent were provided a copper IUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a US family planning clinic that offered same-day IUD placement for women seeking emergency contraception, 11 percent of women chose to receive a same-day IUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A detailed discussion of use of copper intrauterine contraception can be found separately.

Levonorgestrel was more effective than the Yuzpe regimen in preventing pregnancy (two trials, RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31-0.83) and was associated with a lower rate of side effects (nausea RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.39- 0.48; vomiting RR: 0.24, 95% CI 0.18-0.31; headache RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-1.00, breast tenderness RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.69-1.01).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethinyl estradiol plus levonorgestrel (Yuzpe regimen)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial studies of post-coital contraception administered high dose estrogens. In 1974, a low dose regimen using a total dose of ethinyl estradiol (200 mcg) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> (1 mg) was introduced and subsequently termed the Yuzpe regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Treatment was initiated within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.</p><p>Because the Yuzpe regimen is less effective and associated with more side effects than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], the Yuzpe regimen is rarely recommended and combination drugs specifically marketed for emergency contraception are not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Despite these disadvantages, some women prefer estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills because they can be more accessible and more private than levonorgestrel, which is labeled only for use as an emergency contraceptive. With dose adjustment, these women can use standard estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills for emergency contraception (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Estradiol plus levonorgestrel'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiprogestins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ulipristal</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> act as antiprogestins and have similar chemical structures. Both are highly effective for use in emergency contraception. Their primary mechanism of action is delay of ovulation, but endometrial effects that may affect implantation may also contribute to efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A disadvantage of antiprogestins is that the delay in ovulation results in a delay in subsequent menses, which may provoke anxiety about possible pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Randomized trials showed that the next menses after ulipristal emergency contraception occurred at a mean of 2.1 days later than expected while menses occurred 1.2 days earlier than expected in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Ulipristal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ulipristal</a> is a selective <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> receptor modulator with primarily antiprogestin activity. It can delay ovulation by as much as five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Importantly, it appears to be effective in the advanced follicular phase, including after LH levels have begun to rise but not peaked, a time when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> emergency contraception is no longer effective in inhibiting ovulation. It can be used for emergency contraception up to 120 hours after intercourse.</p><p>A meta-analysis of two trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> for emergency contraception found that it was at least or more effective than levonorgestrel at 0 to 24 hours (odds of pregnancy OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.11-0.93), 0 to 72 hours (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33-0.99), and 0 to 120 hours (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.93) after unprotected sexual intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the meta-analysis, at each time interval, the rate of pregnancy in patients receiving ulipristal ranged from 0.9 to 1.4 percent versus 2.2 to 2.5 percent in patients receiving levonorgestrel; these differences were statistically significant. Only 97 women were given ulipristal between 72 and 120 hours after unprotected intercourse, but it is encouraging that none of them became pregnant. By comparison, 106 women took levonorgestrel in the same time frame and three became pregnant. However, given the relatively small number of women and pregnancies with drug administration at 72 to 120 hours, the superiority of ulipristal in this time frame should not be considered proven. There was no difference in the side effect profile of the two drugs.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ulipristal</a> is available worldwide for emergency contraception. In the United States, it is marketed under the name ella and is only available by prescription.

Of the remaining pharmacies, 72 percent stated they could order the medication, with a predicted median wait time of 24 hours (range 21.5 to 26.0 hours). Clinicians are advised to understand their local pharmacies&rsquo; abilities to supply the medication, particularly for women who are approaching the limit of the 120-hour dosing window. While use of ulipristal for the treatment of fibroids has been associated with cases of liver injury, liver injury has not been reported following ulipristal for emergency contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Mifepristone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mifepristone</a>, an antiprogestin, is not available for emergency contraception in the United States, but is available for this purpose in some countries.

Nonhormonal contraception can be started immediately after the use of ulipristal acetate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Regardless of which contraceptive is selected, all women are advised to perform a pregnancy test if they do not have a withdrawal bleed within three weeks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> acetate use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2789045\"><span class=\"h2\">Repeated emergency contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no contraindication to giving a second dose of hormonal emergency contraception if a second episode of unprotected intercourse occurs any time after the first dose was administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Concerns about repeated use of hormonal emergency contraception as a primary contraceptive method include that repeated emergency contraception can be less effective, contains higher hormone levels per dose, and causes more menstrual irregularities than ongoing use of either combined or progestin-only oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a prospective study of 321 fertile women ages 18 to 45 who took levonorgestrel 1.5 mg orally on each day of coitus, the overall pregnancy rate was 7.5 pregnancies per 100 women-years of exclusive emergency contraception use and 11.0 pregnancies per 100 women-years for women under 35 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

With any form of emergency contraception, a pregnancy test should be performed to exclude the possibility of an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy if bleeding has not occurred within three to four weeks or if there is abdominal pain or irregular bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/9,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,76</a>].</p><p>Menstrual bleeding after emergency contraception typically occurs within one week of the expected time. The time to menses resumption after treatment is similar for progestin-only and estrogen-progestin regimens. If the single dose levonorgestrel-only regimen is taken within the first three weeks of the cycle, the next menses will be earlier than usual; the magnitude of this effect is greatest when the pills are taken early in the cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. If taken late in the cycle, the next menses will be prolonged. Cycle length then returns to baseline.</p><p>Data on the outcome of pregnancy after failure of emergency contraception are sparse. A systematic review found no evidence of an increase in risk of ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. There is also no evidence of teratogenic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/9,11,79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,79,80</a>], which is not surprising given that combination hormonal contraceptives when inadvertently taken early in pregnancy have not been associated with teratogenic effects.

This is due to both inconsistent use of regular contraception and underutilization of emergency contraception (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and risk factors for failure'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. Women who obtain emergency contraception in advance are more likely to use it when needed, and not more likely to have unprotected sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, randomized trials have not demonstrated a significant reduction in unintended pregnancy over 12 months when advance provision was compared with standard provision of emergency contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>We suggest that women using barrier, or other contraception, have a home supply of emergency contraceptives in addition to their primary mode of contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As an example, women taking oral contraceptives may run out of their pills or women using depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> may be late returning for their injections. Young adolescents should be counseled about availability and use of emergency contraception so they can access it readily, if needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-contraception/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>].</p><p>Overweight and obese women should be informed that oral emergency contraceptives may be less effective or not effective for prevention of pregnancy as weight increases above the normal range. Reduced efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> has been reported in both overweight and obese women, while the reduced efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> was only reported for obese women. In the event of recent unprotected intercourse, the most effective option (particularly for obese women) is to arrange for placement of a copper-releasing IUD during the five days after the event. If oral emergency contraception is used, ulipristal is more likely to be effective than levonorgestrel.

Pregnancy should be excluded and, if not conclusively excluded by history, pregnancy testing should be performed, particularly before prescribing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> or intrauterine contraception. (See <a href=\"#H1661484419\" class=\"local\">'Prerequisites'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest administering emergency contraception as soon as possible, but up to 120 hours, after an episode of unprotected intercourse in women who wish to prevent pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Given the uncertainty in timing of ovulation, emergency contraception is offered, when indicated, without regard to day of the menstrual cycle. With a negative pregnancy test, a copper IUD is preferably inserted within five days, but may be used within seven days, of an episode of unprotected intercourse. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the copper intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) as the preferred choice for emergency contraception (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). It is more effective than oral emergency contraceptives, its effectiveness is not reduced in overweight and obese women, and it provides ongoing pregnancy prevention. (See <a href=\"#H2658873687\" class=\"local\">'Copper intrauterine contraception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who wish to avoid use of or do not have access to an IUD, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who choose hormonal emergency contraception, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> rather than an estrogen-progestin regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Levonorgestrel is more effective and has fewer side effects than estrogen-progestin therapy. UpToDate suggests a single dose of levonorgestrel 1.5 mg for most women (Grade 2A). It is most effective if given within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse.(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overweight and obese women should be informed that some studies have reported reduced efficacy of oral emergency contraceptives at high bodyweights (&ge;75 kg or &ge;80 kg). In the event of recent unprotected intercourse, the most effective option is to schedule an appointment for placement of a copper-releasing IUD during the five (but up to seven) days after the event. If oral emergency contraception is used, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ulipristal</a> is more likely to be effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> in women of high bodyweight.
