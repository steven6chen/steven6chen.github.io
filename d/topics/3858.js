Since vaginal atrophy often involves vulva and lower urinary tract, the term genitourinary syndrome of menopause has been introduced in those instances linked to menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although vaginal atrophy typically occurs in menopausal women, it can occur in women of any age who experience a decrease in estrogenic stimulation of the urogenital tissues. In premenopausal women, hypoestrogenic states include the postpartum period, lactation, hypothalamic amenorrhea, and during administration of antiestrogenic drugs. </p><p>Up to 70 percent of women with symptoms of vaginal atrophy do not discuss their condition with a health care provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some because they believe their symptoms are an expected and necessary part of the aging process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Cultural, religious, and societal beliefs may also play a role in making women feel uncomfortable discussing concerns related to the genitourinary system. In addition, many women are not aware of treatment options. Rather than seeking treatment, women commonly make lifestyle changes to deal with their symptoms. As an example, they may stop sexual activity due to dyspareunia caused by vaginal dryness. </p><p>Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of vaginal atrophy are reviewed here. Treatment of symptomatic vaginal atrophy, as well as use of estrogen therapy for other menopausal symptoms, is discussed in detail separately.

In premenopausal women, estradiol is the predominant form of circulating estrogen.

Glycogen from sloughed cells is the substrate for D&ouml;derlein's lactobacilli, which convert glucose into lactic acid, thereby creating an acidic vaginal environment (the pH of an estrogenized vagina ranges from 3.5 to 5.0). The acidity of the vagina helps maintain the normal vaginal flora and protect the urogenital area from vaginal and urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Menopause leads to a dramatic reduction in estrogen production, with an approximately 95 percent decline in estradiol concentration from the premenopausal to postmenopausal state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. After menopause, estradiol concentrations plateau at levels averaging 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (It should be noted that most estradiol assays are not sufficiently sensitive to detect postmenopausal estradiol levels accurately) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>This drop in estrogen concentration, exacerbated by the normal aging process, is responsible for many of the adverse changes seen with vaginal atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. These changes usually develop gradually, over a period of years, and, for many women, persist unless they are treated. Hypoestrogenic changes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thinning of the top layer of superficial epithelial cells, which may be entirely lacking in women with severe atrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of elasticity of the vaginal epithelium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased subepithelial connective tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of rugae</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortening and narrowing of the vaginal canal, with loss of distensibility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in vaginal secretions from 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/four</span> hours to 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/four</span> hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in vaginal pH to &ge;5</p><p/><p>Thinning of the vaginal epithelium makes it more susceptible to trauma, leading to bleeding, petechiae, and ulceration with any pressure, including the performing of a Papanicolaou smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71191\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71191 \">figure 2</a>). Thinning also exposes the underlying connective tissue, which is more vulnerable to inflammation or infection. </p><p>The low glycogen content of the thinned epithelium leads to a reduction in lactic acid production by lactobacilli, resulting in an increase in vaginal pH. These changes in the vaginal environment encourage the overgrowth of nonacidophilic coliforms and the disappearance of lactobacillus species, thereby predisposing affected women to infection by skin and rectal flora (eg, streptococci, staphylococci, coliforms, diphtheroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]), as well as Candida species, bacterial vaginosis, and Trichomonas species. The shifting flora and resulting inflammatory changes were the source of the older term for this condition, atrophic vaginitis. </p><p>Urinary tract structures are derived from the same embryologic origin as the genital tract and also contain estrogen receptors. Thus, the bladder, urethra, pelvic floor musculature, and endopelvic fascia are affected by a hypoestrogenic state. Possible consequences of atrophy of the urinary tract include urethral discomfort, urinary frequency, hematuria, dysuria, and an increased frequency of urinary tract infection.</p><p>Menopause is a risk factor for both pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. While it might seem intuitive that estrogen therapy would be useful in the treatment of these problems, there are some data that oral estrogen therapy results in the development or exacerbation of urinary incontinence. No data exist to support systemic or topical estrogen as a therapy for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse.

The combined suppression of ovarian and adrenal activity (loss of adrenal androstenedione reduces estradiol synthesized through extraovarian aromatization) results in extremely low estradiol levels.</p><p/><p>Factors other than low estrogen levels can modulate the degree of atrophy. For example, cessation of coital activity, vaginal nulliparity, and vaginal surgery may intensify vaginal atrophy symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>].

Early in the menopause transition, women may notice a slight decrease in vaginal lubrication upon sexual arousal, which is often one of the first signs of estrogen insufficiency. As the hypoestrogenic state becomes chronic, additional symptoms may be reported by the woman, including a sensation of vaginal dryness during daily activities, not necessarily during sexual activity (the most common symptom), and other symptoms may develop. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of urogenital atrophy is clinical, based upon characteristic symptoms and findings on history and physical examination.

As noted above, many women with these symptoms do not bring them to the attention of a clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>Menstrual and medication history should be taken to assess menopausal status and evaluate for etiologies of low estrogen other than menopause. The clinician should ask about response to any previous interventions. A complete review of systems should be performed, as urogenital symptoms may be due to etiologies other than loss of estrogen. The clinician should elicit symptoms that may be associated with infection or inflammatory conditions, as well as use of products that may be irritants or result in allergic reactions (eg, perfumes, powders, panty liners, soaps, deodorants, spermicides, lubricants, tight clothing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This should also include a history of pelvic radiation. A pertinent sexual history should be taken to evaluate whether the symptoms are associated with sexual activity. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Quality of life issues should also be assessed; these include degree of discomfort, behavioral responses to symptoms, as well as the impact of symptoms on daily activities, sexual activity, and partner relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The clinician should ask about the woman's therapeutic goals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The external genitalia may show scarce pubic hair, diminished elasticity and turgor of the vulvar skin, introital narrowing or decreased moisture, and fusion or resorption of the labia minora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In severe cases, the labia majora may be fused (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54086\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54086 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Loss of the labial fat pad gives the labia majora a pendulous appearance and makes the labia minora less distinct <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> makes the clitoris appear more protuberant. A urethral caruncle may be present and appear as proliferative red tissue at the opening of the urethra. Urethral prolapse or polyps may also occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethral-caruncle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethral caruncle&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In women with severe atrophic changes, exercise caution when performing the speculum and bimanual examinations, as even gentle contact can cause pain and bleeding. Assess for introital stenosis using a gloved finger before attempting insertion of the speculum. A lubricated narrow speculum is most comfortable for a patient. Thus, among metal speculums, a Pederson is usually chosen rather than a Graves speculum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78911\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78911 \">picture 2</a>). A narrow Pederson speculum or a pediatric speculum may be necessary for examining some patients. Plastic speculums are also available in a range of widths and lengths.</p><p>Classic vaginal findings of atrophy include a pale, dry vaginal epithelium that is smooth and shiny with loss of most rugation. If inflammation is present, there may be patchy erythema, petechiae, and blood vessels visible through the thinned epithelium, friability, bleeding, and discharge. The vagina may be shortened, narrowed, and poorly distensible. The cervix may become flush with the vault as the vaginal fornices become obliterated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory tests are usually not necessary, other than for exclusion of other etiologies under consideration. However, a clinical diagnosis of estrogen deficiency can be supported by laboratory studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal pH - The most clinically helpful laboratory test is pH of the vaginal vault secretions. This can be measured in the office with pH paper. The pH of an estrogenized vagina ranges from 3.5 to 5.0. Vaginal pH may reach levels of 5.5 to 6.8 or higher in postmenopausal women, especially those who are not on estrogen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, a pH of &ge;5 of the vaginal vault in the absence of other causes, such as infection or semen in the vaginal vault after recent intercourse, can be considered an indicator of vaginal atrophy due to estrogen deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maturation index - The maturation index can be used to quantify the proportions of cell types of the vaginal epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is determined from cytologic examination of a wet preparation of surface cells from the upper one-third of the vagina. The maturation index is the proportion of parabasal, intermediate, and superficial cells in each 100 cells counted on a smear. In premenopausal women with adequate estrogen levels, intermediate and superficial cells predominate. The maturation index for these women is typically 40 to 70 intermediate cells, 30 to 60 superficial cells, and 0 parabasal cells. In women with vaginal atrophy, an increase in parabasal cells and a decrease in superficial cells are observed. Women in early menopause typically have a maturation index of 65 parabasal cells, 30 intermediate cells and 5 superficial cells. As women age, parabasal cells will continue to increase, and the maturation index may eventually consist entirely of parabasal cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopic examination - Microscopic evaluation of a vaginal smear allows the clinician to identify the loss of superficial cells associated with atrophy, while at the same time, rules out the possibility of infection as an underlying cause of the vaginal symptoms. As discussed above, the wet smear shows small, rounded parabasal epithelial cells (characterized by large nuclei). In addition, the lactobacillus-dominated flora is replaced by a mixed flora of gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci. Large numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes may be present, especially if there is inflammation or infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to women with symptoms of vaginitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical cytology - Findings on cervical cytology in women with atrophic vaginitis can mimic those observed in women with squamous intraepithelial lesions, and can even be confused with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Atrophic epithelium is often characterized by nuclear enlargement, which meets one of the pathologic criteria for atypical squamous cells and low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. For this reason, hypoestrogenic women with atypical squamous cells and low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions may be treated with topical estrogen before further cytological follow-up.

Vaginal atrophy occurs primarily in menopausal women, but may also occur during other hypoestrogenic states (eg, lactation, while taking an antiestrogenic medication). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic vaginal atrophy occurs in approximately 40 percent of menopausal women. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations include vaginal dryness, burning, pruritus, discharge, bleeding, and dyspareunia. Urinary tract symptoms (eg, frequency, recurrent infection) may also occur. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of atrophic vaginitis is clinical, based upon characteristic symptoms and findings on history and physical examination (pale, dry, thin vaginal epithelium that is smooth and shiny with loss of most rugation). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pH of &ge;5 of the vaginal vault in the absence of other causes, such as infection or semen, can be considered an indicator of vaginal atrophy due to estrogen deficiency.
