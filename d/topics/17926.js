It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes, which are usually monoclonal in origin.</p><p>CLL is considered to be identical (ie, one disease with different manifestations) to the mature (peripheral) B cell neoplasm small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), one of the indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The term CLL is used when the disease manifests primarily in the bone marrow and blood while the term SLL is used when involvement is primarily nodal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients will have a complete or partial response to initial therapy. However, with the exception of some of those treated with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), disease relapse invariably occurs. The treatment of relapsed or refractory <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span> will be reviewed here. The initial treatment of CLL, the use of allogeneic HCT in CLL, and the management of complications of CLL are discussed separately.

At these visits, patients are evaluated with a history, physical examination, and blood work. The response assessment and International Workshop on CLL (IWCLL) response criteria are presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating response to treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The IWCLL defines relapsed disease as that which occurs in patients who have previously achieved either a complete or partial remission by these criteria but then develop progressive disease after a period of six months or more.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who fail to achieve either a partial or complete remission with therapy or those who develop disease progression within six months of last therapy have refractory disease. These treatment failures include patients with stable disease, nonresponsive, or progressive disease.</p><p/><p>This distinction is principally made because many patients with progressive disease occurring later after the discontinuation of treatment can be successfully retreated using the same medication, or by switching to other available treatments. In contrast, patients who have refractory disease are unlikely to respond to a trial of the previously used therapy and have a much poorer prognosis.</p><p>The IWCLL response criteria were originally developed using data from patients treated with single agents (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>). As first-line therapy has evolved, the overall response rate and median progression-free survival have increased. The definitions of relapsed and refractory disease will likely change as therapy improves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248755630\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirming the diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before a patient is considered to have <span class=\"nowrap\">relapsed/refractory</span> CLL, the diagnosis of CLL must be reconfirmed. Disorders such as histologic transformation of CLL to large cell lymphoma, the leukemic phase of mantle cell lymphoma, and other malignancies must first be ruled out by the use of appropriate biopsy, cytogenetic, and molecular studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Not all patients with relapsed CLL require imaging studies or biopsy at the time of progression:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of relapsed CLL can be confirmed by a complete blood count with differential, flow cytometry of the peripheral blood to determine the immunophenotype of circulating lymphocytes, and examination of the peripheral smear. We also perform fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the peripheral blood, especially looking for del 17p, at the time of relapse.

Signs or symptoms that suggest histologic transformation include the rapid progression of lymphadenopathy, infiltration of uncommon extranodal sites (excluding the bone marrow), development of systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss, night sweats), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase. Imaging with (18)F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose labelled positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) may help to select a biopsy site.

The choice of chemoimmunotherapy regimen is made based upon patient characteristics, what other therapies the patient has received, and goals of therapy. The expected depth and length of response varies among these regimens. The choice of subsequent therapy is largely dependent upon how an individual patient's response to therapy differs from that expected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H248755533\"><span class=\"h2\">Assess time to progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of treatment at relapse should take into account the quality and duration of response to prior therapy.

This is especially important for patients with refractory disease, traditionally defined as those with a response duration less than six months.</p><p>PFS differs greatly by treatment regimen.

Targeted therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibrutinib</a> or the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idelalisib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">idelalisib</a> plus rituximab) is an acceptable alternative and may be preferred by patients who had significant toxicity with the initial regimen. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Targeted therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The ideal treatment of these patients is not known. However, it is our clinical experience that many of these patients can be successfully retreated using the same medications, or by switching to other available treatments. Specifically, patients initially treated with fludarabine-based regimens can often achieve another complete or partial response upon retreatment if the initial remission duration was sufficient. These observations are supported by an analysis of 94 patients who relapsed more than three years after initial treatment with FCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of the 44 patients retreated with FCR, approximately 70 percent were alive at five years.</p><p>It is not clear how patients initially treated with combination therapy that incorporates an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obinutuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">obinutuzumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofatumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofatumumab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) will respond to re-treatment with these agents at the time of disease progression. However, a trial of retreatment is reasonable if the response duration was not much less than the median expected. Patients with a time to progression considerably shorter than the median reported in clinical trials are treated as patients with insufficient response. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Early relapse (PFS &lt; median expected)'</a> below.)</p><p>While younger, fit patients may be considered for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) at the time to relapse, observational studies suggest that patients in (complete) response at the time of HCT will have a better prognosis. As such, even patients who plan to undergo HCT should be initially treated at the time of relapse to achieve a remission prior to transplant.

Most cases of relapsed CLL can be confirmed by a complete blood count with differential, flow cytometry of the peripheral blood to determine the immunophenotype of circulating lymphocytes, and examination of the peripheral smear. Before initiation of next treatment, FISH testing, in particular for 17p deletion, should be repeated.

Patients who have an initial response duration significantly less than the median for an individual treatment regimen may be considered for a different regimen (more aggressive or &quot;novel&quot; agents) at relapse. Patients with CLL experience serial relapses and many will be treated with all available agents at some point during their disease course. A preferred order for their use has not been established. A choice is primarily made based upon the patient's prior treatment, the regimens' expected toxicities, and the clinician's experience with the regimens.
