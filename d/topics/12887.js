A wide variety of subtypes of panniculitis exist, including panniculitides related to infection, external insults, malignancy, and inflammatory diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85714 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The diagnosis of panniculitis can be challenging because different forms of panniculitis may present with similar clinical findings and many types of panniculitis are rare. A careful clinical assessment that includes an evaluation of patient risk factors, lesion distribution, and associated clinical findings (eg, ulceration, sclerosis, atrophy) can provide valuable clues for diagnosis. </p><p>Although histopathologic examination of the affected area can be of benefit, interpretation of the biopsy findings must be approached with discretion. In the absence of careful clinical correlation and thorough consideration of the clinical and pathologic differential diagnoses, an incorrect diagnosis may be selected.</p><p>The approach to the recognition and diagnosis of panniculitis will be discussed here. The clinical features and management of specific forms of panniculitis are reviewed in greater detail separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2491147\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term panniculitis refers to a group of inflammatory disorders in which the primary site of inflammation is in the subcutaneous fat. In contrast, inflammatory disorders that mainly involve the overlying dermis or underlying fascia and incidentally extend into the nearby subcutaneous fat are not considered types of panniculitis.</p><p>The nomenclature of the panniculitides has been inconsistent and a potential source of confusion. For example, stasis panniculitis, lipodermatosclerosis, sclerosing panniculitis, hypodermitis sclerodermiformis, and chronic panniculitis with lipomembranous changes are synonymous terms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>In other cases, one name has been given to multiple different conditions. Weber-Christian disease, which was once thought to be a distinct entity, appears to have been an overly inclusive term applied to multiple disorders, including alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis, pancreatic panniculitis, factitial panniculitis, lymphoma panniculitis, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With improved ability to identify these conditions, the term &quot;Weber-Christian disease&quot; has largely been abandoned by dermatologists in favor of the more specific diagnoses. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15212538\"><span class=\"h1\">SUGGESTIVE FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suspicion for panniculitis typically first arises from the physical examination. Although the visible findings may be limited to a nonspecific area of erythema, palpation of an affected area reveals the deep-seated nodules and plaques characteristic of an inflammatory process located beneath the dermis. Depending on the type of panniculitis, additional features such as ulceration, atrophy, or sclerosis may also be detected. Associated tenderness is common, but is not always present.</p><p>However, deep inflammatory nodules and plaques are not exclusive to panniculitis, and based upon the clinical scenario, disorders involving the deep dermis or fascia may need to be considered. For example, plaque morphea involving the deep dermis and eosinophilic fasciitis may be difficult to distinguish from deep morphea, which may present with true panniculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F77587\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77587 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-morphea-localized-scleroderma-in-adults#H16539063\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of morphea (localized scleroderma) in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-fasciitis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic fasciitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, benign and malignant tumors can manifest as subcutaneous nodules. If incidental inflammation is also present, it may be difficult to clinically distinguish these tumors from panniculitides. Nodules associated with deep bruising may also be mistaken for panniculitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2491311\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBTYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once panniculitis is suspected, the clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> histopathologic evaluation will help to confirm the presence of panniculitis and to identify the subtype of panniculitis, thereby allowing for proper patient management. Most panniculitides can be placed in one of several etiologic categories. These categories are listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deposition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enzymatic destruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancy</p><p/><p>Definitive information about the relative frequency of panniculitides is not available, but there is general agreement that erythema nodosum is the most common form of panniculitis. Stasis panniculitis is likely an underappreciated, but relatively common phenomenon. Other panniculitides that, while not common, are seen on occasion in a general dermatology practice include traumatic panniculitis, lupus panniculitis, erythema induratum, cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa, subcutaneous granuloma annulare, subcutaneous sarcoidosis, and factitial panniculitis. Select examples of panniculitides in each etiologic category are described below; a more extensive list is provided in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85714 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4122269\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory disorders</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erythema nodosum </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Erythema nodosum occurs most often in young women and typically presents as crops of painful nodules on the shins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76621%7EDERM%2F55744\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76621 graphicRef55744 \">picture 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Associated arthralgias, fever, and malaise are not uncommon. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Histopathologic examination reveals a septal panniculitis with a primarily lymphocytic or mixed inflammatory infiltrate and thickened septa. Histiocytes surrounding a banana-shaped cleft (Miescher's radial granulomas) may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

No cause is found in many cases. Infections, inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, oral contraceptives, pregnancy, and multiple other factors have been associated with erythema nodosum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70718 \">table 2</a>). Streptococcal pharyngitis is the most common identifiable cause.

Indurated plaques with associated erythema, edema, and hyperpigmentation on one or both lower legs (often on the medial aspect) are characteristic and result from the fibrosis and atrophy of subcutaneous fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65447%7EDERM%2F85713\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65447 graphicRef85713 \">picture 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. On the legs, the sclerosis may have an appearance that is reminiscent of an inverted wine bottle or piano leg. Lipodermatosclerosis can also occur in other areas of stasis, such as the abdominal pannus or breasts. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Histopathologic findings in lipodermatosclerosis include overlying features of stasis dermatitis and findings at the level of the subcutaneous fat vary based upon the stage of the disease. Late stage lesions demonstrate thickened, fibrotic septa, extensive fat atrophy, and an inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and foamy macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Lipomembranous change (eosinophilic material lining fat pseudocyst) is frequently present.

A more accurate term for this variant may be &quot;primarily cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa,&quot; since internal organ involvement may also occur. Patients typically present with tender subcutaneous nodules that often ulcerate and associated livedo racemosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75391%7EDERM%2F64023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75391 graphicRef64023 \">picture 5A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The inflammatory infiltrate transitions to a predominantly lymphohistiocytic infiltrate over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The disease often follows a chronic course that may be characterized by periods of exacerbations and clinical remissions. Examples of disorders that have been associated with cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa include streptococcal infection, inflammatory bowel disease, and hepatitis B and C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erythema induratum</strong> &ndash; Erythema induratum typically occurs in young to middle-aged women, and usually presents as nodules on the posterior lower legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64335%7EDERM%2F53596%7EDERM%2F76526\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64335 graphicRef53596 graphicRef76526 \">picture 7A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Unlike erythema nodosum, ulceration is common. Although there is a well-established association with tuberculosis, erythema induratum can be idiopathic or associated with other infections or drugs. The terms erythema induratum and nodular vasculitis have been used synonymously by some authors. Others reserve the term &quot;nodular vasculitis&quot; for cases unassociated with tuberculosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-tuberculosis#H22503432\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of tuberculosis&quot;, section on 'Erythema induratum of Bazin'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4122336\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infectious panniculitis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Infectious panniculitis usually presents as a primarily lobular panniculitis that may be caused by bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, protozoal, or viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It may occur as a result of hematogenous dissemination of microorganisms, direct extension from a nearby focus of infection, or direct inoculation. The appearance of the lesions is dependent on the underlying cause and the severity of infection, ranging from indolent nodules to acute fluctuant abscesses. Immunosuppressed individuals are at increased risk for infectious panniculitis. Microbial cultures and histopathologic stains are useful for diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2492411\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Traumatic panniculitis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Panniculitis can occur at the site of blunt injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. For example, minor trauma to the shins can result in the development of tender subcutaneous nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Histopathologic examination reveals cystic spaces within the fat, variable fibrosis and hemorrhage, and a peripheral lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cold panniculitis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Cold panniculitis may occur in any age group, but occurs most often in very young children, in whom it is sometimes called &quot;popsicle panniculitis.&quot; Patients present with erythematous nodules and plaques at the site of cold injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83785%7EDERM%2F83786\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83785 graphicRef83786 \">picture 8A-B</a>).

Factitial panniculitis should be considered when lesions are in atypical locations or have unusual shapes. Although some cases result from the injection of medical therapies, other cases result from the inappropriate injection of substances for cosmetic purposes (eg, paraffin), or the injection of harmful substances (eg, urine, feces, foods, or chemicals) by patients with emotional disturbances or psychiatric disorders. It is common for patients who deliberately inject harmful substances to deny self-injection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinical manifestations vary with the type and amount of substance injected. Patients may have inflammatory nodules or plaques, and abscesses may develop. The histopathologic findings are also variable. In some cases, the foreign material can be identified on pathologic sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2492437\"><span class=\"h2\">Deposition</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calciphylaxis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Calciphylaxis is an uncommon, life-threatening disorder that most commonly occurs in the setting of end-stage renal failure.

Sites with abundant adipose tissue, such as the thighs and buttocks, are frequently affected. The histopathologic findings are specific, demonstrating calcium deposits within the walls of vessels in the reticular dermis and subcutaneous fat. Necrosis of fat lobules, fat calcification, and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate are also evident. Calciphylaxis is associated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Cold panniculitis is described above.

Affected children develop erythematous nodules 1 to 10 days after glucocorticoid withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The cheeks are a common site of involvement. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The histopathologic findings resemble subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn. A lymphohistiocytic infiltrate is present in the fat lobules and cells with needle-shaped clefts may be detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Lesions spontaneously resolve within a few weeks to a few months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2491494\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2489745\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once panniculitis is suspected, certain clinical clues assist with narrowing the differential and creating a plan for additional work-up. Recollection of the categories of conditions that can present with panniculitis can be useful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85714\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85714 \">table 1</a>).<strong> </strong>Examples of questions that may assist with identifying the most likely cause of panniculitis are reviewed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory </strong>&ndash; Was there a preceding streptococcal infection or other risk factors associated with erythema nodosum? Does the patient have a history of connective tissue disease or symptoms suggestive of a connective tissue disease? Does the patient have a history of chronic lower extremity edema (lipodermatosclerosis)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection </strong>&ndash; Is the patient immunosuppressed? Is the patient acutely ill?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Trauma/stasis</span> </strong>&ndash; Is there a history of local trauma or exposure to cold? Are the lesions occurring in a site that received injections or radiation therapy? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Deposition </strong>&ndash; Does the patient have renal failure (calciphylaxis) or gout?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enzymatic destruction </strong>&ndash; Are there symptoms suggestive of pancreatitis? Does the patient have early-onset emphysema (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malignancy </strong>&ndash; Is there a history of malignancy? Does the patient appear acutely or chronically ill? </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2491564\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because inflammatory nodules and plaques occur in various forms of panniculitis as well as other types of disorders, diagnosing a specific form of panniculitis based only on examination of the affected area is usually difficult. The patient history and an assessment of additional clinical findings, such as ulceration, atrophy, sclerosis, and livedo racemosa can be useful for diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ulceration </strong>&ndash; Occurs in multiple forms of panniculitis, but typically absent in erythema nodosum, which assists with distinguishing this disorder from erythema induratum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atrophy </strong>&ndash; Lesions<strong> </strong>of lupus panniculitis typically resolve with significant atrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sclerosis </strong>&ndash; Lipodermatosclerosis and deep morphea present with features of sclerosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Livedo racemosa </strong>&ndash; Livedo racemosa commonly occurs in association with cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64023 \">picture 5B</a>).</p><p/><p>In addition, the location of lesions may also provide important diagnostic clues. Examples of preferential sites of involvement for specific panniculitides are listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erythema nodosum </strong>&ndash; anterior lower legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erythema induratum </strong>&ndash; posterior lower legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Lipodermatosclerosis/stasis</span> panniculitis </strong>&ndash; medial lower legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis </strong>&ndash; buttocks, flanks, and thighs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Subcutaneous sarcoidosis </strong>&ndash; forearms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lupus panniculitis </strong>&ndash; face, scalp, upper arms, breasts, upper trunk, buttocks, and thighs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15212571\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsies can provide valuable information for diagnosis, and are indicated in cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain or to confirm the diagnosis in cases in which the clinical course of a panniculitis does not proceed as expected. Biopsies are most useful when findings characteristic of a specific form of panniculitis are identified. However, the histopathologic findings are often ambiguous. In many cases, clinical correlation and careful consideration of the differential diagnosis is required to arrive at a correct diagnosis.</p><p>Although biopsies are usually well tolerated, potential consequences include scarring, infection, and poor wound healing. Therefore, in situations in which the clinical evaluation yields a relatively certain diagnosis, the decision to perform a confirmatory biopsy is individualized. As an example, the benefit gained from the histologic confirmation of the diagnosis of erythema nodosum is not necessarily worth the resulting scar from deep excisional biopsy in a typical, short-lived case. Similarly, the benefit gained from histologic confirmation of lipodermatosclerosis may or may not be worth the risk of having a chronic wound on the lower leg. However, in other situations, a biopsy is critical for proper patient evaluation and management. For example, the attainment of a tissue specimen for histopathologic examination and microbial studies is essential when infectious panniculitis is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4122783\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to achieve the highest diagnostic yield, the biopsy specimen must include a generous sample of the subcutaneous fat. This is best accomplished by an elliptical excision performed with a scalpel. Alternatively, a large (6 to 8 mm) punch biopsy may be performed. Elliptical excisions often result in more cosmetically-satisfactory scars. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;, section on 'Biopsy techniques'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15212578\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcutaneous fat has a fairly simple structure, consisting mainly of fat cells that are organized in lobules divided by fibrous septa, together with vessels and nerves. The panniculitides are often classified based on the histologic findings, particularly the location of the pathologic process (septal versus lobular) and the presence or absence of vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85715\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85715 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/panniculitis-recognition-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,24</a>]. To narrow the histologic differential diagnosis, the following questions are addressed during histopathologic examination: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the pathology primarily in the fat? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the pathologic process predominantly in the septa, lobules, or both? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is vasculitis present? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What types of cells make up the inflammatory infiltrate? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What other features are present (eg, necrosis, organisms, crystals, calcium, foreign material)? </p><p/><p>Although evaluation of the pathology in the context of the clinical findings often establishes the diagnosis, there are limitations to consider during the interpretation of the biopsy findings. These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative lack of complexity of subcutaneous tissue means that there is a relatively small number of ways the subcutaneous fat can appear histologically. Even with an optimal sample, it may not be possible to narrow the histologic differential diagnosis to one entity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory infiltrates are not absolutely confined to septa in septal panniculitis, and are not limited to lobules in lobular panniculitis. The fundamental distinction between a septal and a lobular panniculitis is based on the predominant location of the infiltrate. In practice, this can be a difficult distinction to make, particularly if the sample size is small.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The biopsy may not include a sufficient amount of subcutaneous fat. This is particularly likely with small punch biopsies but can also occur with excisions if the practitioner is not careful to include an adequate sample of subcutaneous fat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An inadequate biopsy or insufficient sampling of an adequate biopsy may affect the ability to detect the presence of vasculitis. For example, a biopsy that may initially appear to be erythema nodosum may be revealed to be polyarteritis nodosa when additional sections are examined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic changes evolve as lesions mature.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2491529\"><span class=\"h3\">Special studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, obtaining a diagnosis may require investigation beyond the clinical evaluation and routine histopathologic examination. When infection is in the clinical differential diagnosis, tissue cultures and histologic stains for organisms are usually indicated. If malignancy is suspected, special studies to determine cell type may be required. In cases of panniculitis where the diagnosis is not straightforward, the tissue sample should be polarized to look for foreign material. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4122811\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on the diagnoses suspected based upon the clinical and histopathologic examinations, other tests may aid in identifying the cause of panniculitis. Examples include tests to evaluate patients for pancreatitis, tuberculosis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, and autoimmune disease. If evaluation reveals a diagnosis associated with other disorders, such as erythema nodosum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70718 \">table 2</a>) or subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn (hypercalcemia), additional testing is performed as indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15212585\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &quot;panniculitis&quot; is used to refer to inflammatory disorders in which the primary site of involvement is the subcutaneous fat.
