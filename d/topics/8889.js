It occurs more often in the winter months because people spend more time in close contact with one another. The flu is spread easily from person to person by coughing, sneezing, or touching surfaces.</p><p>Every year, complications of the flu require more than 200,000 people in the United States to be hospitalized. Serious illness is more likely in the very young, older adults, pregnant women, and people who have certain health problems such as asthma or other forms of lung disease.</p><p>There have been several widespread flu outbreaks (called pandemics), which led to the deaths of many people worldwide. These outbreaks occurred when new strains of influenza viruses formed (often from pigs or birds) and humans became infected because they had no immunity to these viruses.</p><p>This article discusses the symptoms and treatment of seasonal, swine H1N1, and avian flu. Treatments to prevent the flu, including the flu shot, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Influenza prevention (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">FLU SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of seasonal flu can vary from person to person but usually include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever (temperature higher than 100&ordm;F, or 37.8&ordm;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache and muscle aches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough and sore throat may also be present</p><p/><p>People with the flu usually have a fever for two to five days. This is different than fever caused by other upper respiratory viruses, which usually resolve after 24 to 48 hours.</p><p>Most people with the flu have fever and muscle aches, and some people also have cold-like symptoms (runny nose, sore throat). Flu symptoms usually improve over two to five days, although the illness may last for a week or more. Weakness and fatigue may persist for several weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56899\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56899 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Flu complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of influenza occur in some people; pneumonia is the most common complication. Pneumonia is a serious infection of the lungs and is more likely to occur in young children, people over the age of 65, people who live in long-term care facilities (nursing homes), and those with other illnesses such as diabetes or conditions affecting the heart or lungs. Pneumonia is also more common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have had a transplant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">FLU DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Influenza is usually diagnosed based on symptoms (fever, cough, and muscle aches). Lab testing for influenza is performed in certain cases, such as during a new influenza outbreak in a community and in patients who are at increased risk for complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">FLU TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">When to seek help</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with the flu recover within one to two weeks without treatment. However, serious complications of the flu can occur. Call your doctor or nurse immediately if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You feel short of breath or have trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have pain or pressure in your chest or stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have signs of being dehydrated, such as dizziness when standing or not passing urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You feel confused</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You cannot stop vomiting or you cannot drink enough fluids</p><p/><p>In children, you should seek help if the child has any of the above or if the child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has blue or purplish skin color</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is so irritable that he or she does not want to be held</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does not have tears when crying (in infants)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a fever with a rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does not wake up easily</p><p/><p>There are several groups of people who are at increased risk for flu complications. These include pregnant women, young children (&lt;5 years of age and especially &lt;2 years of age), people &ge;65 years of age, and people with certain diseases such as chronic lung disease (such as asthma), heart disease, diabetes, immunosuppressing conditions (such as HIV infection or transplantation), and some other diseases. If you or your child has flu symptoms and is at increased risk for flu complications, you should call your healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Treat symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treating the symptoms of influenza can help you to feel better but will not make the flu go away faster.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest until the flu is fully resolved, especially if the illness has been severe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids &ndash; Drink enough fluids so that you do not become dehydrated. One way to judge if you are drinking enough is to look at the color of your urine. Normally, urine should be light yellow to nearly colorless. If you are drinking enough, you should pass urine every three to five hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) can relieve fever, headache, and muscle aches. Aspirin and medicines that include aspirin (eg, bismuth subsalicylate [sample brand name: Pepto-Bismol]) are not recommended for children under 18 because aspirin can lead to a serious disease called Reye syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough medicines are not usually helpful; cough usually resolves without treatment. We do not recommend cough or cold medicine for children under age six years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiviral medicines can be used to treat or prevent influenza. When used as a treatment, the medicine does not eliminate flu symptoms, although it can reduce the severity and duration of symptoms by about one day. Not every person with influenza needs an antiviral medicine, but some people do; the decision is based upon several factors. If you are severely ill <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have risk factors for developing complications of influenza, you will need an antiviral agent. People who are only mildly ill and have no risk factors for complications are usually treated with an antiviral medicine if they have had symptoms for 48 hours or less, but they are not treated if they have had symptoms for more than 48 hours.</p><p>Antiviral medicines that are used to treat or prevent the flu include oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), zanamivir (brand name: Relenza), and peramivir (brand name: Rapivab). Two other antiviral medicines, rimantadine and amantadine, were used in the past but are generally no longer effective because most flu viruses are now resistant to them. Antiviral treatment is most effective for seasonal influenza when it is taken within the first 48 hours of flu symptoms.</p><p>The best antiviral medicine depends upon the type of influenza virus, if the virus could be resistant, and some individual factors. A doctor or nurse should make this decision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-seasonal-influenza-with-antiviral-drugs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of seasonal influenza with antiviral drugs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-seasonal-influenza-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of seasonal influenza in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-prevention-and-treatment-with-antiviral-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention and treatment with antiviral drugs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of pandemic H1N1 influenza ('swine influenza')&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zanamivir and oseltamivir can cause mild side effects, including nausea and vomiting; zanamivir, which is inhaled, can cause difficulty breathing in some cases. Diarrhea is the most common side effect of peramivir. Most people are able to continue the medicine despite the side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics are <strong>NOT</strong> useful for treating viral illnesses such as influenza. Antibiotics should only be used if there is a bacterial complication of the flu such as bacterial pneumonia, ear infection, or sinusitis. Antibiotics can cause side effects and lead to development of antibiotic resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Complementary and alternative treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a wide variety of herbal, homeopathic, and other complementary and alternative treatments that are marketed for influenza. Unfortunately, there have been few well-designed studies to evaluate their efficacy and safety.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTING FLU</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments to prevent influenza are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Influenza prevention (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392867\"><span class=\"h1\">SWINE H1N1 FLU</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A new strain of H1N1 influenza, which contains parts of swine, avian, and human influenza viruses, was first seen in humans in March 2009 in Mexico. Human infections subsequently occurred around the world and caused a pandemic that continued until August 2010. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of pandemic H1N1 influenza ('swine influenza')&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of infection with the swine H1N1 flu virus and treatment for it were generally similar to those of seasonal flu.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392874\"><span class=\"h1\">AVIAN FLU</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Avian influenza (bird flu) is caused by a strain of influenza virus that originally infected birds. Infected birds include chickens, ducks, and geese, among others.</p><p>There are several strains of avian flu; the H5N1 avian flu virus is the cause of concern since it has led to several deaths in people, mostly in Asia. Another type of avian flu that causes illness in people is called H7N9. To date, avian flu has primarily spread from bird to bird and much less commonly from bird to human; human-to-human transmission has occurred rarely. Most humans who became infected with avian flu had direct contact with sick or dead poultry or wild birds or had very recently visited a live poultry market. No human cases of avian influenza have been described in the United States or elsewhere in North America.</p><p>Avian flu is frequently severe, and there is little natural immunity in the human population. At least one antiviral medicine (oseltamivir) might improve the chance of surviving the infection. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Antiviral treatment'</a> above.)</p><p>There is a vaccine to prevent avian flu. The vaccine is not commercially available but has been stockpiled by the United States government in case it is needed in the future.</p><p>Updated information about avian influenza is available from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsSlSuvT5EjuUV0t71otSS2izQILO++SHZHPgK2H5JKHs&amp;TOPIC_ID=4010\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4010\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
