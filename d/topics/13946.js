In this situation, postoperative radiation therapy (RT), generally in conjunction with chemotherapy, can improve the likelihood of disease-free survival. </p><p>Postoperative chemoradiotherapy is generally restricted to patients thought to be at high risk of locoregional recurrence. It should be used with caution and only in those at high risk because of the morbidity of adding chemotherapy to postoperative RT and the uncertainty regarding a survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. RT alone remains an alternative for patients with intermediate levels of increased risk or for those who cannot tolerate concurrent chemotherapy.</p><p>Factors that have been associated with an increased risk of locoregional recurrence after surgery include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced tumor (T) stage <span class=\"nowrap\">(T3/T4)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive resection margins or tumor close to the resection margin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor extension through the lymph node capsule (extracapsular extension)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two or more pathologically positive lymph nodes <span class=\"nowrap\">(N2/N3)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perineural invasion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphovascular space invasion</p><p/><p>Positive margins and extracapsular extension are the two most unfavorable parameters, both of which are associated with significant increases in local-regional recurrence and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The definition of positive margins is not standardized; however, invasive tumor within 5 mm of the resection margin is commonly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Metastases in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or less in greatest dimension (ie, N1 lymph node stage), is not considered a high-risk feature in the absence of other adverse factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Extracapsular extension may have a different significance in the patient with HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer. Two retrospective studies have shown that extracapsular extension is not a negative prognostic feature in these patients, not affecting disease-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or disease-specific survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], unlike oral cavity carcinoma. Other traditional risk factors, advanced T-stage and number of nodal metastases, were associated with decreased survival. Prospective trials to confirm these data are, thus, needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CHEMORADIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials have demonstrated that postoperative concurrent chemoradiation therapy is more likely than postoperative radiation therapy (RT) alone to control locoregional disease and improve disease-free survival for patients at high risk of recurrent disease. Thus, we recommend postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy over postoperative RT alone for patients at highest risk (ie, those with positive surgical margins and extracapsular extension).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two large cooperative group trials compared adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with postoperative RT alone and provide insights into which patient subsets benefit from a combined approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial 22931, 334 patients with resected high-risk head and neck cancer were randomly assigned to RT alone (66 Gy in 33 daily 2 Gy fractions) or the same dose with concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> on days 1, 22, and 43 of RT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. High-risk disease was defined as a T3 or T4 primary with any nodal stage (except T3N0 laryngeal cancer), positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, or oral <span class=\"nowrap\">cavity/oropharyngeal</span> primary sites with involvement of level IV or V lymph nodes. With a median follow-up of 60 months, postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy significantly improved five-year progression free survival, locoregional control, and overall survival compared with postoperative RT alone (47 versus 36 percent, 82 versus 69 percent, and 53 versus 40 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9501 trial randomly assigned 459 patients with resected high-risk head and neck cancer to RT alone (60 to 66 Gy in 30 to 33 fractions) or the same dose of RT with concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> on days 1, 22, and 43 of RT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. High-risk patients were limited to those with positive resection margins, involvement of two or more lymph nodes, or extracapsular nodal extension. In an initial report with a median follow-up of 46 months, concurrent chemoradiotherapy significantly improved two-year locoregional control and disease-free survival compared with RT alone (82 versus 72 percent and 54 versus 45 percent, respectively). However, the increase in overall survival was not statistically significant (64 versus 57 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, updated results at 10 years found that the differences were no longer statistically significant in terms of locoregional failure (22 versus 29 percent), disease-free survival (20 versus 19 percent), or overall survival (29 versus 27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There were statistically significant differences observed in patients with extracapsular spread or positive margins for locoregional control and disease-free survival and a trend for better overall survival in an unplanned subgroup analysis.</p><p/><p>In both trials, the incidence of acute severe mucosal toxicity was significantly greater with postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy compared with RT alone (77 versus 34 percent in the EORTC trial), but late complications were comparable for both treatments.</p><p>The failure of these two trials to reach the same conclusion (ie, that concurrent chemoradiotherapy improves locoregional control, disease-free survival, and overall survival) has been attributed to the different patient populations included in these two trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. When comparative analyses were performed on pooled data from these trials (including selection criteria, clinical and pathologic risk factors, and treatment outcomes), extracapsular extension and microscopically involved surgical margins were the only risk factors for which the impact of postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy was significant in both trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Consequently, we and others recommend postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy over postoperative RT alone primarily for patients with positive surgical margins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extracapsular extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Whether concurrent chemoradiotherapy should be routinely added to postoperative RT for patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer and other adverse features is less clear. Consideration of the primary site is important, since adjuvant chemoradiotherapy may not provide greater benefit than RT alone in the HPV positive oropharyngeal cancer patient, and is being evaluated in a prospective trial (<a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01687413?term=NCT01687413&rank=1&amp;token=NK91I08KOJ1eJ1hT1o/oHgJu4vbbEBRl2V0d48fIIMCmbX27ecEIWHJk3XkRCpv9yug9tDzHZQMbyioGRmcSglwoEuPJRhw/oKHMzM5s9To=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3374\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT01687413</a>).

For patients with microscopically positive margins or extracapsular extension, we recommend a 6 Gy boost in three fractions for a total dose of 66 Gy to that region. For those with grossly positive margins, the site of residual disease should be boosted to a total dose of 70 Gy.</p><p>Patients with high-risk features (positive surgical margins, extracapsular extension) who are not candidates for postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy are treated with doses of at least 60 Gy. Dose-response relationships are less well understood when concurrent chemotherapy is utilized, but most high-risk volumes typically receive doses &ge;60 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions.</p><p>The neck is also included with postoperative RT. Subclinical regions (ie, clinically negative neck) that have not been resected are electively treated to the equivalent of 50 Gy in 25 fractions, which would be 54 Gy if 30 fractions are delivered at 1.8 Gy per fraction to the dissected neck. Operated but non-tumor-bearing areas get 56 to 57 Gy. Involved nodal regions receive 60 Gy in 30 fractions, and regions of extracapsular extension may receive an additional boost of 4 to 6 Gy in two to three fractions.</p><p>In an early clinical trial that aimed to establish the optimal dosing for conventionally fractionated postoperative RT and that provided the initial evidence for a dose-response relationship, 261 evaluable patients were randomly assigned to one of three dose levels (57.6, 63, or 68.3 Gy, all given with 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">Gy/day</span> fractionation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/4,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,27</a>]. In an initial interim analysis, 17 patients treated with a dose of &le;54 Gy had a significantly higher primary failure rate compared with those treated with higher doses, and that group was dropped from the trial. In a final analysis with more than 20 years follow-up, no significant dose response was demonstrated at doses &ge;57.6 Gy in the final analysis in either the intermediate- or high-risk groups. On multivariate analysis, negative surgical margins, the absence of extracapsular extension, and total treatment time &lt;85 days were independently associated with better locoregional control and overall survival. However, it is important to note that many of the high-risk patients included in this trial would currently receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and it is therefore difficult to know how these data apply to such patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional postoperative RT schedules typically deliver 54 to 66 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions, over five to seven weeks.</p><p>Altered-fractionation RT schedules, including accelerated RT and hyperfractionation, have been investigated to overcome accelerated repopulation and to safely escalate the dose. These strategies when compared with conventional, once-daily RT have demonstrated improved locoregional control, but a survival benefit has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].

Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) and refinements, such as image-guided RT (IGRT), are used wherever available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'External beam radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>3D-CRT usually starts with large fields covering all areas at risk to 50 Gy, followed by shrinking fields to boost higher risk areas. The spinal cord is excluded after 40 Gy. A final boost treatment to the primary tumor bed and neck regions with involved lymph nodes may be administered using either EBRT or brachytherapy.</p><p>Retrospective studies suggest that a treatment boost with brachytherapy may improve local control for patients with positive tumor margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. However, brachytherapy is used less frequently since the majority of patients with positive margins typically receive chemotherapy concurrently with postoperative RT, and the brachytherapy catheters must be available to be placed at the time of surgery.</p><p>IMRT typically delivers a dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. CTV1 (high-risk areas) gets 60 Gy, CTV2 gets 57 Gy (intermediate-risk operated areas), and CTV3 (non-operated, elective areas, eg, N0 contralateral neck) gets 54 Gy. A boost for extracapsular extension or positive microscopic margins, as described above, can be used to 66 Gy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H541274485\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative versus preoperative RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT is now used as an adjuvant almost exclusively in the postoperative period. Concerns about operating in an irradiated field, the poorer local control in one older trial, the ability to use pathologic findings to guide high-dose RT planning, and the use of functional organ preservation approaches (chemoradiotherapy) have led to the abandonment of preoperative RT for head and neck cancer. In the RTOG 7303 trial, preoperative RT used a dose of 50 Gy and the local control was worse than postoperative radiotherapy with a dose of 70 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].
