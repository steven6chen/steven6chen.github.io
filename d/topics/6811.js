Nonacute scrotal conditions in adults and scrotal disorders in children and adolescents are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-nonacute-scrotal-conditions-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of nonacute scrotal conditions in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-scrotal-pain-or-swelling-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of scrotal pain or swelling in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The testis, tunica vaginalis, epididymis, spermatic cord, appendix testis, and appendix epididymis are anatomic structures that may be involved in nonacute scrotal conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75672\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75672 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The testis (testicle) is the male gonad responsible for production of sperm and androgens (primarily testosterone). The normal testis is ovoid, about 3 to 5 cm in length, and firm with smooth surfaces. One testis may be slightly larger than the other, and one testis (usually the left) may hang slightly lower.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tunica vaginalis is a fascial layer which encapsulates a potential space that encompasses the anterior two-thirds of the testis. Different types of fluid may accumulate within the tunica vaginalis (eg, water with a hydrocele, blood with a hematocele, pus with a pyocele).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The epididymis is a tightly coiled tubular structure located on the posterior aspect of the testis running from its superior to inferior poles. Sperm travels from the tubules of the rete testis into the epididymis, which joins the vas deferens distally. The function of the epididymis is to aid in the storage and transport of sperm cells that are produced in the testes, as well as to facilitate sperm maturation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spermatic cord, which consists of the testicular blood vessels and the vas deferens, is connected to the base of the epididymis and traverses into the retropubic space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The appendix testis is a small vestigial structure on the anterosuperior aspect of the testis, representing an embryologic remnant of the M&uuml;llerian duct system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67439\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67439 \">figure 2</a>). It measures approximately 0.3 cm in length and is predisposed to torsion (twisting), particularly during childhood, because of its pedunculated shape. The appendix epididymis is a Wolffian duct vestigial structure found on the top of the epididymis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68998244\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1676146713\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first priority in the evaluation of the acute scrotum is to identify any condition that requires urgent medical or surgical intervention. The most common causes of acute scrotal pain in adults are acute epididymitis (or epididymo-orchitis) and testicular torsion. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of acute epididymitis is associated with increased morbidity. Delayed surgical intervention of testicular torsion can lead to loss of the testis, infertility, and other complications. Although much less common, Fournier's gangrene (necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum), which can cause acute scrotal swelling, is a surgical emergency. (See <a href=\"#H3954340778\" class=\"local\">'Acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Testicular torsion'</a> below and <a href=\"#H54909477\" class=\"local\">'Fournier's gangrene'</a> below.)</p><p>The initial evaluation of acute scrotal pain includes a directed history and physical examination. Patients should be asked about the nature and timing of the onset of pain, its location, and the presence of fever and lower urinary tract symptoms (eg, frequency, urgency, dysuria). Patients should be asked about any prior history of inguinal or scrotal surgery. The abdomen, inguinal region, and scrotal skin and contents should be carefully examined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75672\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75672 \">figure 1</a>). The normal testis is ovoid, about 3 to 5 cm in length, and firm with smooth surfaces. One testis may be slightly larger than the other, and one testis (usually the left) may hang slightly lower. The epididymis, which is a spongy, tube-shaped structure, is palpable along the posterior aspect of each testis.</p><p>The cremasteric reflex (lightly stroking the superior and medial part of the thigh to make the cremaster muscle contract and pull up the ipsilateral testis) should be assessed. Examination for an inguinal hernia is best performed with the patient standing. The inguinal areas should be inspected for bulges, and a provocative maneuver (eg, cough) may be necessary to expose the hernia. If a hernia is not apparent on inspection, the maneuver should be repeated as the clinician invaginates the scrotum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The location of scrotal symptoms and physical examination findings can inform the probable cause, as outlined below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56026\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56026 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2771956110\"><span class=\"h3\">Diffuse scrotal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main diagnostic considerations for diffuse scrotal pain include testicular torsion, acute epididymo-orchitis, and Fournier&rsquo;s gangrene. For patients who are febrile, the initial step is to rule out Fournier&rsquo;s gangrene, which is characterized by diffuse scrotal, groin, and lower abdominal pain, tenderness, and swelling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58093\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58093 \">picture 1</a>) and necessitates urgent surgical evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H54909477\" class=\"local\">'Fournier's gangrene'</a> below.)</p><p>If Fournier&rsquo;s gangrene is not suspected, testing the cremasteric reflex may be helpful in determining the most likely cause of diffuse scrotal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the cremasteric reflex is negative (the testis does not pull up when the ipsilateral thigh is stroked), a presumptive diagnosis of testicular torsion can be made. Other supportive findings include a high-riding testis, bell clapper deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55518 \">figure 3</a>), and profound testicular swelling. If clinical features are classic, the diagnosis can be made on these findings alone. However, if the findings are less clear, scrotal ultrasound should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. All patients with suspected or confirmed testicular torsion should be referred urgently for urologic evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Testicular torsion'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the cremasteric reflex is positive (the testis pulls up when the ipsilateral thigh is stroked), acute epididymo-orchitis or orchitis is the likely diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In acute epididymo-orchitis, there is pain, swelling, and tenderness of the testis with some localization posteriorly. Fever and lower urinary tract symptoms may be present. Urinalysis, urine culture, and urine studies for <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> should be obtained in this setting. For patients with suspected acute epididymo-orchitis, antibiotic therapy should be given empirically while awaiting test results. (See <a href=\"#H3954340778\" class=\"local\">'Acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acute orchitis from mumps is characterized by diffuse testicular swelling and tenderness and may be difficult to distinguish from acute epididymo-orchitis. Supportive findings for mumps would include a local outbreak and the presence of constitutional symptoms and parotitis. Suspicion of mumps should prompt serologic testing. (See <a href=\"#H562920128\" class=\"local\">'Mumps orchitis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1322469678\"><span class=\"h3\">Localized scrotal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with localized scrotal pain and tenderness, the location can suggest potential causes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If symptoms are localized to the posterior aspect of the testis, a presumptive diagnosis of acute epididymitis can be made. Lower urinary tract symptoms may be present. Urinalysis, urine culture, and urine studies for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em> should be obtained in this setting. For patients with suspected acute epididymitis, antibiotic therapy should be given empirically while awaiting test results. (See <a href=\"#H3954340778\" class=\"local\">'Acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If symptoms are localized to the upper pole of the testis, testicular appendiceal torsion is likely. Another supportive finding is the blue dot sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65781\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65781 \">picture 2</a>), which occurs in a minority of patients. (See <a href=\"#H54909243\" class=\"local\">'Torsion of the appendix testis'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3978548234\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the cause of scrotal pain is not evident after the initial evaluation or symptoms do not improve with empiric treatment, other causes of scrotal pain should be considered. These include trauma, post-vasectomy pain, testicular cancer, immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura), acute idiopathic scrotal edema, and referred pain (diagnosis of exclusion). In these settings, a scrotal ultrasound and urology referral for consultation are advised. (See <a href=\"#H1816144542\" class=\"local\">'Less common etiologies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3285827841\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON ETIOLOGIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3954340778\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute epididymitis is the most common cause of scrotal pain in adults in the outpatient setting, accounting for 600,000 cases per year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. More advanced cases may present with testicular pain, swelling, and tenderness (epididymo-orchitis). As the evaluation and management of acute epididymo-orchitis is similar to that of acute epididymitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], we will refer only to acute epididymitis in this section.</p><p>Acute epididymitis is most commonly infectious in etiology but can also be from noninfectious causes such as trauma and autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Noninfectious causes generally present as subacute or chronic epididymitis and are discussed elsewhere.

Men of any age who engage in insertive anal intercourse are also at increased risk for acute bacterial epididymitis from exposure to coliform bacteria in the rectum. Other less common organisms responsible for acute epididymitis include <em>Ureaplasma</em> species, <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-genitalium-infection-in-men-and-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma genitalium infection in men and women&quot;</a>), <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, and <em>Brucella</em> species.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3603594390\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of acute epididymitis include localized testicular pain with tenderness and swelling on palpation of the affected epididymis, which is located posteriorly on the testis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75672\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75672 \">figure 1</a>). More advanced cases present with testicular pain and swelling (epididymo-orchitis) with scrotal wall erythema and a reactive hydrocele.</p><p>In rare cases, acute epididymitis can cause serious illness. It is characterized by severe pain and swelling of the surrounding structures, often accompanied by fever, rigors, and lower urinary tract symptoms (frequency, urgency, and dysuria). It may be seen in conjunction with acute prostatitis (epididymo-prostatitis), particularly in older men who may have underlying prostatic obstruction or have undergone recent urologic instrumentation.</p><p>The diagnosis of acute epididymitis is made presumptively based on history and physical examination after ruling out other causes requiring urgent intervention. (See <a href=\"#H1676146713\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.) In all suspected cases, a urinalysis, urine culture, and a urine nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em> should be performed, although urinalysis and urine culture are often negative in patients without lower urinary tract symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Identification of a pathogen on urine or urethral swab testing supports the presumptive diagnosis.</p><p>With the exception of mumps, isolated orchitis without epididymitis is very uncommon in adults and so epididymo-orchitis should be the primary diagnosis to consider when an adult appears to have orchitis. However, in non-immune adults, mumps and other &ldquo;childhood&rdquo; viruses can rarely cause orchitis. (See <a href=\"#H562920128\" class=\"local\">'Mumps orchitis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-scrotal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of scrotal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Orchitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2745746919\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of acute epididymitis varies according to its severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most cases can be treated on an outpatient basis with oral antibiotics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), local application of ice, and scrotal elevation. Acutely ill patients may warrant hospitalization for parenteral antibiotics and intravenous hydration.</p><p>Empiric antimicrobial treatment should be given pending NAAT and culture results based on the most likely pathogens as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients under the age of 35 or who are at risk of sexually transmitted infections (eg, sex outside of monogamous relationship)</strong> &ndash; We suggest coverage for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis </em>with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (250 mg intramuscular injection in one dose) <strong>plus</strong> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg orally twice a day for 10 days).

If fixation is absent or insufficiently broad-based, the testis may torse (twist) on the spermatic cord, potentially producing ischemia from reduced arterial inflow and venous outflow obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77468\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77468 \">figure 4</a>).

Nausea and vomiting may be associated. Another common presentation, particularly in children, is awakening with scrotal pain in the middle of the night or in the morning, likely related to cremasteric contraction with nocturnal sexual stimulation during the rapid eye movement sleep cycle. The patient should be asked about prior similar episodes that might suggest intermittent testicular torsion.</p><p>The classic finding is an asymmetrically high-riding testis with its long axis oriented transversely instead of longitudinally related to shortening of the spermatic cord from the torsion (&quot;bell clapper deformity&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55518 \">figure 3</a>). Profound testicular swelling occurs early, while a reactive hydrocele and overlying erythema of the scrotal wall may be evident 12 to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. In the early stages, an experienced examiner can often differentiate the swollen, exquisitely tender testis from the softer, less tender epididymis posteriorly. It is often possible to detorse a testis during examination by gentle rotation away from the midline. Relief of pain with detorsion indicates likely testicular torsion. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Manual detorsion'</a> below.)</p><p>The cremasteric reflex should be assessed by stroking or gently pinching the skin of the upper thigh while observing the ipsilateral testis. A normal response is cremasteric contraction with elevation of the testis. The reflex is usually absent in patients with testicular torsion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56026\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56026 \">table 1</a>). This finding helps distinguish testicular torsion from acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis and other causes of scrotal pain in which the reflex is generally intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

On physical examination, a reactive hydrocele is often present that may transilluminate, and tenderness is localized to the appendix testis on the anterosuperior testis. Careful inspection of the scrotal wall may detect the classic &quot;blue dot&quot; sign (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65781\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65781 \">picture 2</a>), which is caused by infarction and necrosis of the appendix testis but seen in a minority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>If the diagnosis is unclear on physical examination, a scrotal ultrasound can be performed that will show the torsed appendage as a lesion of low echogenicity with a central hypoechogenic area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-acute-scrotal-pain-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Color Doppler imaging reveals normal blood flow to the testis with an occasional increase on the affected side, possibly related to inflammation.</p><p>Management of acute torsion of the appendix testis consists of the local application of ice and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Recovery is gradual, with some discomfort often lasting for weeks to months.

However, only rarely does it result in severe testicular injury, usually from compression of the testis against the pubic bones from a direct blow or straddle injury. The spectrum of traumatic complications can range from a hematocele (blood within the tunica vaginalis) to a pyocele (pus within the tunica vaginalis) to testicular rupture. Color Doppler ultrasonography can accurately diagnose the extent of any injury. Testicular rupture requires surgical repair. Uncomplicated injuries are managed conservatively. Young men who engage in sports where blunt scrotal injury risk is high (eg, hockey, lacrosse) should wear appropriate protection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54909446\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-vasectomy pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have had a vasectomy may have firmness in the entire epididymis secondary to ductal obstruction. Some men will develop a painful nodule at the site of division of the vas deferens on the testicular side. The nodule is a sperm granuloma that forms because of leakage of sperm from the lumen of the vas deferens, creating an immunologic response to the &quot;foreign&quot; protein, which was previously sequestered from immune surveillance by the blood-testis barrier. Management consist of NSAIDs, local application of ice (10 to 15 minutes a few <span class=\"nowrap\">times/day)</span> for one to two days, and warm baths (20 minutes daily) thereafter.

Examination for an inguinal hernia is best performed with the patient standing. The inguinal areas should be inspected for bulges, and a provocative maneuver (eg, cough) may be necessary to expose the hernia. If a hernia is not apparent on inspection, the cough should be repeated as the clinician invaginates the scrotum. A strangulated hernia may be associated with severe pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76424\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76424 \">picture 3</a>). Pain with inguinal hernias is most likely to be localized in the groin or abdomen rather than the scrotum. Bowel sounds may be audible in the scrotum. Groin ultrasound or CT scan may be helpful if the clinical diagnosis is uncertain. Management of inguinal hernias is discussed separately.

There is often severe testicular pain and tenderness, with swelling and erythema of the scrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66233\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66233 \">picture 4</a>); bilateral involvement is present in up to 30 percent of cases.

Although much less common, Fournier's gangrene (necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum), which can cause acute scrotal swelling, is a surgical emergency.

Patients should be asked about the nature and timing of the onset of pain, its location, and the presence of lower urinary tract symptoms (eg, frequency, urgency, dysuria) and constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, chills). The abdomen, inguinal region, and scrotal skin and contents should be carefully examined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75672\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75672 \">figure 1</a>). A urinalysis and urine culture, as well as diagnostic studies for <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> should be obtained if the diagnosis of acute epididymitis is being considered or if lower urinary tract symptoms are present.
