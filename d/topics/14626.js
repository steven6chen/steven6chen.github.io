Blood is thus unable to flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery and lungs, and an alternative source of pulmonary blood flow is required for survival.

Although all of these defects can result in complete obstruction of RVOT blood flow, they have different morphologic anatomic features (eg, right ventricular size and function, presence of pulmonary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tricuspid valve abnormalities, and status of the ventricular septum), which have an impact on management decisions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> features developmental abnormalities of the right ventricle and tricuspid valve that are &quot;upstream&quot; of the pulmonary outflow. The pulmonary arteries are small, but their architecture and branching are otherwise normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary atresia (PA) with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) more often features a normally-formed right ventricle and tricuspid valve with &quot;downstream&quot; abnormalities of the pulmonary artery architecture, in addition to the VSD. This congenital heart lesion is often termed &quot;tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia&quot; and frequently includes major aortopulmonary collateral arteries that supply blood to the pulmonary vascular bed.

There is no difference in the incidence based on gender.</p><p>However, these studies may underestimate the true incidence of <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> because of spontaneous abortions (which may occur, especially if there is severe tricuspid regurgitation and hydrops fetalis) and elective termination (which may take place when an early diagnosis is made by fetal echocardiography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258049037\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> is unknown. Compared with other cardiac lesions, identifiable genetic syndromes and other cardiac malformations are less common in <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span>. Although there are isolated reports of familial cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS,</span> including one publication that implicates a single gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], evidence is insufficient to establish a consistent genetic association.</p><p>It has been proposed that <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> is an acquired lesion due to perturbation in fetal blood flow, based on reports of serial ultrasound studies showing the development of pulmonary atresia in fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. This theory has led to fetal interventions including in-utero dilation of the pulmonary valve to promote blood flow through the right ventricular outflow tract. (See <a href=\"#H1359931076\" class=\"local\">'Fetal intervention'</a> below.)</p><p>In some cases, it has been proposed that viral infection or inflammatory disease in mid-term gestation creates an atretic pulmonary valve and the subsequent abnormalities of fetal blood flow, resulting in <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span>. However, <strong>no</strong> relationship has been established between <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> and maternal rubella, despite the reported associations between pulmonary stenosis and maternal rubella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>In contrast, pulmonary atresia with a ventricular septal defect <span class=\"nowrap\">(PA/VSD)</span> is thought to be an early gestational developmental lesion resulting from an abnormality in primary morphogenesis of the heart. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetralogy-of-fallot-with-pulmonary-atresia-and-major-aortopulmonary-collateral-arteries-tof-pa-mapcas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (TOF/PA/MAPCAs)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258049044\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> consists of a wide variety of anatomical cardiac defects that are associated with the primary lesion of pulmonary atresia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101334\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101334 \">figure 1</a>). In 2000, the Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project established a unified reporting system for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction that defined <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> as a duct-dependent congenital malformation with a spectrum of lesions, which include pulmonary atresia, variable degrees of hypoplasia of the right ventricle (RV) and tricuspid valve (TV), and anomalies of the coronary circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Because of the diversity of anatomic findings, there is not a standard universal approach for <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> repair. Interventions (ie, biventricular repair, univentricular palliation, or hybrid repair) are based on the individual morphologic features of the RV, TV, and coronary artery circulations. (See <a href=\"#H27930387\" class=\"local\">'Options for repair or palliation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258049051\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary valve atresia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS,</span> the underlying morphology of pulmonary atresia is either valvar (membranous) or muscular.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valvar (membranous) pulmonary atresia &ndash; In most cases, the pulmonary valve is atretic with a small valve annulus, and identifiable but fused valve leaflets, which form a thin, intact membrane that causes RVOT obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/7,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19</a>]. In these patients, the RV and infundibulum (funnel-shaped muscular structure that forms the RVOT below the pulmonary valve, also referred to as the conus arteriosus) are usually well developed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscular pulmonary atresia &ndash; In approximately 20 to 25 percent of patients, there is obliteration of the muscular infundibulum resulting, in muscular pulmonary atresia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Muscular pulmonary atresia is usually associated with severe right ventricular hypoplasia, increased risk and severity of coronary artery abnormalities, and poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518116564\"><span class=\"h2\">Right ventricle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is great variation in the morphology of the RV, ranging from a severely hypoplastic small cavity with marked muscular hypertrophy to a large, dilated, thin-walled chamber. This variation is due to the degree of intracavitary muscular overgrowth. Normally, the RV is composed of three parts (tripartite): an inlet, a body (trabecular), and an outlet. The majority of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> will have a well-formed tripartite RV (59 to 83 percent); others will have a bipartite RV due to apical trabecular overgrowth resulting in a small ventricle composed of an inlet and body, but no discernible outlet (15 to 34 percent); and a small number of patients will have a unipartite RV due to both infundibular and apical trabecular overgrowth, resulting in a severely hypoplastic RV with only a detectable inlet (2 to 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p>Patients with a tripartite RV are more likely to be candidates for biventricular repair, as their RV can support full pulmonary blood flow. (See <a href=\"#H27930387\" class=\"local\">'Options for repair or palliation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258049058\"><span class=\"h2\">Tricuspid valve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The size of the TV is highly variable, and the valve is often small and dysplastic with stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> regurgitation. The size of the tricuspid annulus correlates with the size and morphology of the RV and the presence of coronary abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99865\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99865 \">picture 1</a>), and is a factor in deciding on the choice of intervention (biventricular repair versus univentricular palliation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The TV size is compared with normal values and reported as a &quot;Z-score,&quot; which represents the number of standard deviations from the normal mean valve annulus size. Usually, a TV Z-score of -4 correlates with a unipartite ventricle, while a Z-score of -2 to 0 accompanies a tripartite ventricle. Z-scores of -4 to -2 are associated with variable degrees of RV hypoplasia. Both the TV Z-score and the RV size must be evaluated, as some studies show only moderate correlation between these measurements, and each are factors in determining whether patients are suitable candidates for biventricular repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In a small minority of patients (4 to 10 percent), the TV may be inferiorly displaced in the RV, and is referred to as an Ebstein (or &quot;Ebstenoid&quot;) anomaly of the TV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/4,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7</a>].

In patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS,</span> abnormal connections between the RV and the coronary arteries are common due to the high pressure in the dysplastic right ventricular cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99865\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99865 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/7,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21-23</a>]. Sinusoids, vascular pores within the ventricular myocardium that persist from fetal life, occur in approximately 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The reported incidence of fistula in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS,</span> defined as a direction connection between sinusoid and coronary artery, ranges from 50 to 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/3,7,22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,22,24</a>]. Patients with a severely hypoplastic TV and a small, hypertensive RV are more likely to have fistulae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/3,7,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,25,26</a>]. Fistulae between the RV and the coronary arteries through histoanatomical connections may lead to proximal coronary stenoses or interruptions. Other coronary abnormalities include complete absence (atresia) of the aortocoronary connection, stenosis of the normally branching coronary arteries, or abnormal connections between the right and left coronary system.</p><p>In approximately a quarter of cases, there is a right ventricular dependent coronary circulation (RVDCC), defined as coronary blood flow that is at least partially dependent upon retrograde blood flow from the RV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. RVDCC occurs when a communicating RV fistula arises in the presence of an atretic or stenotic coronary artery connection proximal to the RV-coronary connection, which prevents or limits the antegrade myocardial perfusion resulting in RVDCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/3-5,7,24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,7,24,27</a>]. Recognition of this clinical scenario is important, because RV decompression may lead to coronary artery steal, ischemia, infarction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sudden cardiac death when the RVOT obstruction is relieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27</a>]. Coronary arteries may receive blood flow only from the hypertensive RV, resulting in deoxygenated blood that delivers less oxygen to the myocardium compared with normal, fully oxygenated aortic blood flow. This may contribute to the long-term ventricular dysfunction that is associated with coronary abnormalities in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Based on the above data, it is crucial that angiography is performed to identify and define any coronary artery abnormality and determine its potential impact both pre- and post-intervention on myocardial perfusion. (See <a href=\"#H597292146\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac catheterization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518116525\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulmonary circulation is usually supported with a normal, left-sided patent ductus arteriosus connecting to confluent pulmonary arteries that exhibit a normal branching pattern from the main pulmonary trunk. Rarely, patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> have abnormal development of the pulmonary arteries and connections from the aorta to the pulmonary arteries called major aortopulmonary collateral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. While gross anatomic abnormalities of the pulmonary arterial tree are uncommon, one histologic study of the pulmonary arteries in <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> revealed significant medial and intimal abnormalities, possibly related to ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535752701\"><span class=\"h2\">Other anatomic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other less common anatomic defects may affect the left ventricle, aortic valve, and right atrium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535752708\"><span class=\"h3\">Left ventricle and aortic valve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The left heart may exhibit aortic stenosis or a bicuspid aortic valve. The morphology of the left ventricle (LV) is usually normal, but the LV function may be affected by coronary insufficiency, which can be exacerbated by chronic perfusion of cyanotic blood from the RV leading to further coronary insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A mild or moderate obstruction of the LV outflow tract by the hypertrophied interventricular septum has also been described in approximately 45 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These authors have presented theoretical connections between the presence of right ventricular coronary sinusoids and left ventricular noncompaction, but further studies are required to confirm this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535752715\"><span class=\"h3\">Right atrium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to tricuspid regurgitation, the right atrium may be enlarged, sometimes compressing the right lung. Usually a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect exists to allow egress of blood from the right to the left atrium; a pressure-restrictive PFO is rare and most often leads to fetal demise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H291329\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS,</span> pulmonary atresia causes right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction. With an intact ventricular septum, there are only two ways for blood to exit the right ventricle (RV): via tricuspid regurgitation back into the right atrium, and through connections between the RV and the coronary artery circulation (ie, fistulae and sinusoids) (see <a href=\"#H258049065\" class=\"local\">'Coronary arteries'</a> above). Return of blood to the systemic circulation is primarily dependent on blood flow from the right atrium through the foramen ovale into the left atrium, and subsequently, the left ventricle. In addition, blood passing out of the RV via sinusoids is returned to the systemic circulation through the coronary circulation.</p><p>RV pressure is dependent on the extent of the RV egress. In cases with limited tricuspid regurgitation and coronary circulation egress, RV pressure increases and may rise to supra-systemic levels, in some cases as high as 200 mmHg. In contrast, in patients with free tricuspid regurgitation, the RV pressure may be nearly normal with a significant amount of blood returned to the right atrium followed by flow into the left atrium across a patent foramen ovale.</p><p>In neonates with <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS,</span> the ductus arteriosus is small compared with normal infants, as fetal blood flow from the pulmonary artery through the ductus arteriosus is limited due to RVOT obstruction. However, after birth, a patent ductus arteriosus is crucial for survival, as it is the sole source of pulmonary blood supply.

Although infants may have mild tachypnea or hyperpnea, severe respiratory distress is uncommon and differentiates these patients from those with cyanosis due to a pulmonary cause (eg, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome). In addition, these infants generally have a benign fetal and birth history.</p><p>If untreated, <span class=\"nowrap\">PA/IVS</span> is an almost uniformly fatal disease; approximately 50 percent of children will die within two weeks of birth and 85 percent by six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-atresia-with-intact-ventricular-septum-pa-ivs/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In this study, elevated RV end-diastolic pressure and mild or no tricuspid regurgitation were predictors of need for additional pulmonary blood flow.
