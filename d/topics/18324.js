Normally, healthy kidneys excrete a myriad of compounds. Uremic retention solutes accumulate in the patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including the patient with Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) stage 5 disease or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The retention of these solutes is directly or indirectly attributable to deficient renal clearance.</p><p>These retained solutes are called uremic toxins when they contribute to the uremic syndrome. Only a few solutes have an established role. Apart from inorganic compounds, only a few compounds conform to the strictest definition of uremic toxins. However, this does not preclude a potential role for various other retention solutes.

At least in observational studies, the degree of urea clearance also clearly correlates with clinical outcome of patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, urea kinetic modeling is one of the principal tools to estimate and (if necessary) correct the dialysis dose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, high blood concentrations of urea may not necessarily correlate with poor outcome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High serum concentrations of urea due to adequate protein intake that are compensated by adequate removal may be relatively harmless as compared with high urea levels due to inadequate dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low urea levels related to low protein intake may negatively correlate with prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p>It is also unclear whether the kinetic behavior of urea is representative of the behavior of other uremic retention solutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Data suggest that the dialytic removal of lipophilic protein-bound compounds, as well as that of several other water-soluble compounds, is different from that of urea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>].</p><p>The validity of urea kinetic modeling has principally been tested with the small pores found in older dialysis membranes. Since the removal of urea is adequate with such membranes but the removal of larger molecules is absent or low, the clearance of middle molecules may not be clearly represented by urea kinetic modeling. Therefore, some investigators have asked whether there should be a search for marker molecules that are representative of large <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lipid-soluble compounds. Findings consistent with this view include overall survival advantages for those enrolled after greater than 3.7 years of hemodialysis treatment, cardiovascular survival advantages for the entire group of hemodialysis patients treated with large-pore dialyzers, and a survival advantage for patients with a lower beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m) concentration, irrespective of the membrane type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/23,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,35-37</a>]. However, these results were from secondary analysis of the HEMO study and need to be confirmed in prospective, sufficiently powered studies.</p><p>Urea and middle molecule removal can be dissociated, with a survival advantage for the higher middle molecule removal. In the randomized, controlled Membrane Permeability Outcome (MPO) study, the group on high-flux membranes with larger pores had a superior removal of larger molecules as illustrated by lower predialysis beta2-m concentrations over time compared with the group on low-flux dialyzers with smaller pores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Although removal of small, water-soluble molecules as estimated by <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> was the same for the two membranes, survival was significantly better in patients with serum albumin &lt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> which is the patient group for which the study was originally designed, and, at secondary analysis, in diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a smaller randomized, controlled trial that compared on-line hemofiltration with low-flux hemodialysis, hemofiltr<em>a</em>tion resulted in a decrease in beta2-m concentrations and a survival advantage in spite of a lowering of <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Nevertheless, as urea removal has been related to survival, urea kinetic modeling should continue to be used as a baseline parameter for the study of dialysis adequacy.

This may result in vasoconstriction, hypertension, immune dysfunction, and neurologic abnormalities.</p><p>Although arginine (which is also a guanidino compound) markedly enhances the production of NO, some of the other guanidines, as arginine analogs, are strong, competitive inhibitors of NO synthase. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is significantly increased in ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], is the most specific endogenous compound with inhibitory effects on NO synthesis. In the brain, ADMA causes vasoconstriction and inhibition of acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. It has also been implicated in the development of hypertension, adverse cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>], progression of kidney failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], renal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], and mortality (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and epidemiology of coronary heart disease in end-stage renal disease (dialysis)&quot;</a>). Administration of ADMA to healthy volunteers resulted in an increase of vascular resistance and blood pressure in a dose-related manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. It was also demonstrated that ADMA increased vascular stiffness and decreased cerebral perfusion in healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. It has been suggested, based on solute dialysance data, that ADMA was protein bound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The increase in symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), the steric variant of ADMA, is more pronounced than that of ADMA, but, until recently, this compound has been considered biologically inactive. However, SDMA was linked to an increase in reactive oxygen production and an inhibition of NO synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Subsequently, SDMA was associated with an increase in free radical production by leukocytes; this effect was attributed to an increased calcium influx via store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (SOCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In an extensive study that evaluated a panel of guanidino compounds on several cell systems involved in vascular damage, SDMA most consistently induced proinflammatory effects in various types of leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In addition, SDMA also induced monocytic cytokine production, in contrast to ADMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In the clinical arm of this study, SDMA in CKD patients was more significantly correlated to interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels compared with ADMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. SDMA also modified high-density lipoprotein (HDL) into an abnormal molecule, inducing endothelial damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Removal of guanidines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The generation of the guanidines synthesized from arginine in the proximal convoluted tubule, such as guanidinoacetic acid and creatine, is depressed in ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The reported concentration of guanidinoacetic acid is not elevated among uremic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. On the other hand, the synthesis of guanidino succinic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guanidine</a>, and methylguanidine is markedly increased, which appears to be due to urea recycling. The reported concentrations of guanidino succinic acid and methylguanidine are increased in uremia compared with normal concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F85916\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85916 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Dialytic removal of the guanidines, despite their low molecular weight, is not consistently comparable with that of urea. Many of these compounds display different intradialytic behavior compared with urea, suggesting a pluricompartmental distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/33,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,63</a>]. In the absence of protein binding, this behavior points to a retardation in the transfer of these molecules from inside to outside of cells. These findings have been confirmed from direct estimations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Further mathematical analysis revealed that increasing dialysis time was the preferred strategy to improve removal of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guanidine</a> compounds that had larger distribution volumes (such as methylguanidine, for example), whereas more frequent dialysis preferably impacted upon compounds with a smaller distribution volume (such as guanidino succinic acid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Optimal results were obtained with a combination of daily and long, slow dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Nondialytic removal of ADMA is less dependent on renal excretion than on metabolic transformation, which is inhibited in renal failure. Enhancing metabolism might decrease ADMA concentration. Proof of principle is suggested by studies that showed that genetic overexpression of the ADMA-degrading enzyme, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase, was cardioprotective in mice following heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Furthermore, since the transmethylation reaction catalyzed by this enzyme is stimulated by lowering homocysteine levels, ADMA concentration was decreased by coadministration of intravenous methylcobalamin and oral folate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. These data illustrate how uremic solutes may influence each other's concentration and how removal depends not only on renal function and dialysis but also on metabolism, which can be influenced externally by administration of drugs, vitamins, or nutritional additives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxalate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Massive oxalate retention is uncommon in dialyzed patients, except in primary hyperoxaluria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In this disorder, production is increased due to genetically mediated alterations of oxalate metabolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperoxaluria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperoxaluria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among ESRD patients without primary hyperoxaluria, serum oxalate concentrations are increased approximately 40-fold compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Secondary oxalosis in such patients is characterized by the deposition of calcium oxalate in multiple tissues, which was mostly observed in early renal replacement therapy with inefficient dialysis strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Oxalate resulted in an increase of intracellular calcium in endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], leading to disturbed endothelial proliferation and repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Oxalate also decreases glucuronidation, a detoxifying conjugation process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Oxalate accumulation may be worsened by excessive intake of oxalate precursors, including ascorbic acid, green leafy vegetables, rhubarb, tea, chocolate, or beets. In addition, those with inflammatory bowel disease are at risk for this complication.</p><p>The role of pyridoxine (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a>) in uremic oxalate accumulation remains a matter of debate. In rats with renal failure, pyridoxine depletion results in increased urine oxalate excretion and depressed renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In hemodialysis patients, pyridoxine at 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> causes a decrease in oxalate concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. However, such high doses of pyridoxine may induce gastrointestinal intolerance.</p><p>Dialytic removal of oxalate is similar to that of urea and, therefore, is relatively easy with any of the classic dialysis strategies. However, since removal is lower than clearance from the body in healthy controls, serum concentrations remain higher than normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452041399\"><span class=\"h2\">Uric acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of findings point to the involvement of uric acid in the development of uremic complications, especially cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/76-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-80</a>]. However, a major confounder in epidemiological studies is that factors associated with a high uric acid concentration, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, are cardiovascular risk factors, whereas therapeutic options to decrease uric acid, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>, may be the cause of morbid complications.</p><p>Uric acid contributes to insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction in human umbilical vein umbilical cells (HUVECs), potentially leading to the development of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Uric acid has been linked to mortality in a number of association studies. In the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) study, high uric acid was associated with overall and cardiovascular mortality, but the association disappeared after correction for kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In a Mendelian randomization study, both uric acid itself as well as a score composed of a number of genetic polymorphisms associated to high uric acid were associated with multiple cardiovascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>In observational trials, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> was associated with arterial stiffness, even after correction for confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In a Japanese section of the Dialysis Outcomes Patterns Study (DOPPS), allopurinol was associated with overall mortality, albeit only in the subpopulation without previous cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>In a long-term, randomized, controlled trial, the group treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> had a lower number of cardiovascular events and a slower progression of kidney failure, but the small sample size of the study was a limitation factor, so this study needs confirmation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

Phosphorus excess also inhibits 1 alpha-hydroxylase and hence the production of calcitriol, the active vitamin D metabolite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Phosphorus retention also alters polyamine metabolism by causing a decrease in intestinal dysfunction and proliferation of intestinal villi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Hyperphosphatemia is also linked to vascular calcification, proinflammatory mechanisms, and klotho deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. This mechanism leads to a rise in fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), a large molecule that increases in concentration early in the course of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>] and has a strong predictive value for negative outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>] and subsequently, in animal studies, has been shown to also cause biological effects such as cardiac hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].

The results are less compelling in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. However, dietary phosphate restriction reduces parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels over a wide range of serum calcium concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. In observational studies, high serum phosphorus is linked to mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. The same applies also for low serum phosphorus, very likely because low phosphorus is an indicator of inadequate nutritional status.</p><p>Blood phosphorus concentration is the result of protein catabolism and protein intake as well as of the ingestion of other dietary sources. Restriction of oral protein intake increases the risk of malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>], which can be avoided by the administration of oral phosphate binders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. By providing a balanced dietary advice, it is, however, possible to substantially reduce serum phosphorus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. This includes the avoidance of processed foods, which many contain excessive quantities of phosphorus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p>The effect of oral phosphate binders is often insufficient, especially in subjects with high intake. One major effect related to hyperphosphatemia is the increase in serum Ca x P product resulting in Ca deposition in the tissues, especially the vessel wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>], which is a negative prognostic factor in patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Of note, however, Ca x P product was abandoned by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines on chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD) as it was considered a mathematic artifact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. This does not exclude the individual roles of both Ca and P in vascular disease of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Application of calcium-containing intestinal phosphate binders may decrease P, but this effect may be counterbalanced by a rise in Ca [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].</p><p>The newer generation of phosphate binders, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a> and lanthanum, may provide a solution to this problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].

Slower dialysis techniques may allow a better control of phosphate levels (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a>). In a study strictly controlling all other dialysis parameters, for example, an increase of high-flux dialysis duration from four to eight hours was accompanied by a time-dependent rise in phosphate removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic acidosis can contribute to some of the abnormalities in ESRD.

Because of their strong protein binding, their removal by classical dialysis is hampered, with removal of small, water-soluble molecules being completely different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/30,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,116</a>]. It is therefore conceivable that alternative removal methods (eg, adsorption or convective transport) should be developed before adequate elimination of these toxins can be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/117,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">117,118</a>].</p><p>However, evidence underscores that conjugates of p-cresol, p-cresyl sulfate and p-cresyl glucuronate, and not p-cresol are present in the blood of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/116,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">116,119</a>]. Previous repeated measurements of p-cresol were related to the fact that most determination methods applied strong acidification for deproteinization, a measure resulting in deconjugation of p-cresyl sulfate and p-cresyl glucuronate by hydrolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/120,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,121</a>]. Since this hydrolysis is conceivably proportional to the quantity of conjugates available, former p-cresol measurements as well as estimations of protein binding are likely proportional to what would have been found by direct measurement of the conjugates.</p><p>High-flux dialysis, compared with low-flux dialysis, has no beneficial effect on the removal of these toxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/30,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,117</a>]. However, compared with peritoneal dialysis, p-cresol is cleared better with high-flux hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. Nevertheless, the plasma concentrations of protein-bound toxins are lower in patients on peritoneal dialysis compared with those on hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/122,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">122,123</a>]; these findings cannot be explained by differences in dietary protein intake or residual renal function, suggesting a role for metabolism <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intestinal handling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].</p><p>P-cresol is an end product of protein catabolism, produced by intestinal bacteria that metabolize tyrosine and phenylalanine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. Environmental sources of p-cresol are toluene, menthofuran, and cigarette smoke. Specific concern is warranted regarding menthofuran, which is present in several herbal medicines, flavoring agents, and psychedelic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. In view of the known role of the intestine in the generation of p-cresol and its conjugates, several approaches that interfere with intestinal generation of these toxins have been studied and shown to decrease their concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'General removal strategies'</a> below.)</p><p>In several studies, p-cresol concentration was related to parameters of clinical outcome, including hospitalization rate (particularly due to infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>], clinical symptoms of the uremic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>], mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>], and cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/129,130\" class=\"abstract_t\">129,130</a>]. The same associations were also demonstrated with p-cresyl sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/131,132\" class=\"abstract_t\">131,132</a>] and existed among patients with earlier stages of CKD (CKD 2 to 4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. The latter observation suggests that protein-bound solutes may exert a toxic effect on the general population or at least those not affected by marked kidney disease. In a prospective, observational analysis, p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate were independently associated with progression of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. A meta-analysis confirmed the negative association of p-cresyl sulfate with hard outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>].</p><p>The number of data underscoring the biochemical (toxic) effect of the conjugates is steadily growing. Of note, in most of the more recent studies, correct concentrations were applied while also taking into account the effect of protein binding. In one study, it was demonstrated that p-cresyl sulfate stimulated baseline leukocyte activity, thereby pointing to a proinflammatory effect, whereas the parent compound p-cresol essentially inhibited activated leukocyte function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>]. Another study found that retained p-cresol and p-cresyl sulfate altered endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. Several studies showed effects related to tubular damage and progression of renal failure, such as an enhanced expression of cytokine and inflammatory genes in proximal tubular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>], epithelial mesothelial transition, fibrosis, and glomerulosclerosis through the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>] and suppression of klotho gene expression leading to fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. Oxidative stress damage has been demonstrated in rat tubular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>], and the induction of insulin resistance and reallocation of adipose cells has been demonstrated in different tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. The leukocyte-activating impact of p-cresyl sulfate has been demonstrated in whole human blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. In one study, the second conjugate, p-cresyl glucuronide, combined with p-cresyl sulfate, had an additive effect on leucocyte oxidative burst activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. P-cresyl sulfate, administered peritoneally or intravenously, increased rolling of leukocytes along the endothelium of peritoneal vessels, as directly visualized by in vivo microscopy, and p-cresyl sulfate and p-cresyl glucuronide induced vascular leakage for albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. These data suggest a direct toxic effect of these molecules on vascular endothelium and an induction of the cross-talk between vascular endothelium and leukocytes, which is a primary step of a chain of events leading to vascular damage.</p><p>The concern has been expressed that, even if correct uremic concentrations were applied in studies on protein-bound toxins, the (near) absence of albumin may have resulted in an increased percentage of non-protein-bound fraction, which is the fraction that exerts biological activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. However, in a systematic review that was limited to experimental studies that used correct free concentrations of p-cresyl sulfate, several studies confirmed the biological effects of p-cresyl sulfate at uremia-relevant concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>]. The analysis, which also included studies on indoxyl sulfate, in total included 27 publications, of which several complied with high-quality standards.</p><p>Although the conjugates are present in the blood stream, it remains unclear whether, under some conditions, they may not be reconverted to p-cresol intracellularly, especially since certain cell types such as the leukocytes contain sulfatases and glucuronidases.</p><p>Previously, only a few studies that examined how to improve removal of the phenols by extracorporeal strategies were performed. One study showed superior dialytic clearance of p-cresol by high-flux hemodialysis compared with peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>], although, as noted previously, plasma concentrations were lower in peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. Among dialysis strategies, convective approaches were more efficient compared with diffusive ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/147-149\" class=\"abstract_t\">147-149</a>]. In another study, increasing dialysate flow and dialyzer surface area while decreasing blood flow in an extended dialysis setting increased removal of protein-bound solutes without altering <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. However, as compared with standard, four-hour dialysis three times per week, a longer session (eight-hour dialysis) three times per week had no significant impact on protein-bound solute concentration; this was in contrast to observations with small, water-soluble compounds and middle molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. However, a nonsignificant trend for increased removal of protein-bound molecules was observed in this study. In contrast, if hemodialysis was extended without decreasing blood or dialysate flow as compared with standard, a significant increase in removal with extended dialysis could be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>By applying combined fractionated plasma separation and adsorption, removal of p-cresol could be markedly enhanced, a strategy used as an artificial liver (Prometheus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. Unfortunately, the approach applied in this study resulted in major coagulation disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]. However, the study offers proof that adsorption may become an additional asset in the removal of this type of compound. In an in vitro setting, embedding adsorptive material on a high-flux membrane markedly enhanced the removal capacity for protein-bound toxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p>As far as convective strategies are concerned, it was shown that postdilution and predilution hemodiafiltration were not different regarding removal of p-cresyl sulfate. Both hemodiafiltration strategies were superior to predilution hemodiafiltration for p-cresyl sulfate and other protein-bound compounds, whereas postdilution hemodiafiltration was superior to predilution hemodiafiltration for all other types of uremic retention solutes (ie, the small, water-soluble compounds and the larger &quot;middle molecules&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>].</p><p>The cresols, as several other protein-bound toxins, are the end product of metabolic transformation of amino acids by intestinal microbiota and by conjugation processes in the intestinal wall or liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. In uremia, the microbiota are modified in favor of species especially generating those uremic toxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>], which is confirmed by the finding of an increased generation of p-cresol as kidney dysfunction progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. There are studies suggesting that intestinal bacterial production and intestinal uptake of p-cresol can be altered. As an example, prevention of the intestinal absorption of p-cresol by administration of oral sorbents (AST-120) decreased its serum concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. In a metabolomic study in rats, the same sorbent decreased the concentration of a host of mainly protein-bound uremic solutes, including p-cresyl sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. In addition, the prebiotic arabino-xylo-oligosaccharide (AXOS) decreased p-cresyl sulfate in mice, while decreasing its biochemical impact mainly related to insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. However, in a mouse model of CKD, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a> hydrochloride administration had no impact on the concentration of any of the protein-bound compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>], and the same was observed in a subsequent study in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. Dietary intake may alter the generation of p-cresyl sulfate. In one study of 26 individuals with normal renal function, the average p-cresyl sulfate excretion (reflecting generation) was 62 percent lower among vegetarians than among participants on an unrestricted diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. A metabolomic comparison between hemodialysis patients with and without colon showed striking differences in protein-bound and other uremic toxin concentrations, including p-cresyl sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>].</p><p>The quality of studies assessing interventions to modify the intestinal microbiota or their metabolism in CKD is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>], and hard outcome studies remain scarce [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>]. A randomized, controlled trial on dietary fiber supplementation showed a decrease in indoxyl sulfate concentration but not in p-cresyl sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>]. In another randomized, controlled trial, administration of a symbiotic resulted in a decrease of p-cresyl sulfate concentration, especially in patients who received no antibiotics during the course of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Homocysteine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Homocysteine (Hcy) is a sulfur-containing amino acid produced by the demethylation of methionine.

In an attempt to unravel the mechanism of these profound alterations, it was shown that, in the presence of indoxyl sulfate, the glycocalyx, a molecular layer protecting the endothelium, was affected. Heparan sulfate, one of the main components of the glycocalyx, was found in increased concentration in the serum of indoxyl sulfate-treated rats.

In a group of CKD patients not yet on dialysis, the sorbent AST-120 (Kremezin R) actively decreased indoxyl sulfate in a dose-dependent way, as appreciated from a short-term, prospective, dose-finding study. There were no differences in decline of kidney function, however, possibly due to the short observation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/223\" class=\"abstract_t\">223</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, in a prospective, observational analysis, p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate were independently associated with progression of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. In small, controlled studies with a long follow-up period, the group on AST-120 showed a slower decline of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), was started later on dialysis, and survived longer once dialysis was started [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/224-226\" class=\"abstract_t\">224-226</a>].

The study contained no control of whether the group on AST-120 showed a decrease in plasma concentration of protein-bound uremic toxins. Also, in another study, no impact of AST-120 on progression of CKD could be observed, but, in this study, the administration of the sorbent was not associated with a marked decrease in indoxyl sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/228\" class=\"abstract_t\">228</a>].</p><p>Oral administration of bifidobacteria in gastro-resistant capsules modifying intestinal microbiota to hemodialysis patients reduces serum levels of indoxyl sulfate by correcting gastrointestinal microbiota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/229,230\" class=\"abstract_t\">229,230</a>]. Dietary intake may also alter serum levels of indoxyl sulfate.

Enhancing this removal (eg, by applying bioartificial kidneys seeded with living tubular cells) may increase removal of these compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/322\" class=\"abstract_t\">322</a>].</p><p/><p>Finally, it should be considered that, in uremia, not only strategies decreasing solute concentration are important, but interventions countering their biological impact also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Typically, this can be obtained with already developed drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in neutralizing Ca influx due to symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/323\" class=\"abstract_t\">323</a>], but also with drugs still to be developed and would reach a much broader population than with removal strategies (ie, not only the 0.1 to 0.2 percent of the global population with stage 5 chronic kidney disease [CKD], but all those with stage 3 CKD or more [5 to 10 percent]). Similarly, interventions increasing metabolic degradation of toxic solutes may be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Some experimental studies suggest that the concentration of indoxyl sulfate can be decreased by interventions increasing the activity of sulfotransferase, the enzyme responsible for the sulfation of the parent compound, indole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/324\" class=\"abstract_t\">324</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uremic syndrome is a complex mosaic of clinical alterations that may be attributable to one or more of the different solutes retained in <span class=\"nowrap\">uremia/chronic</span> kidney disease (CKD). Knowledge about the nature and kinetic behavior of the responsible compounds may help when new therapeutic options are considered in the future.</p><p>The following factors, which have frequently been neglected, may interfere with uremic solute concentrations and their impact on biological functions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to classical sources of uremic solutes such as dietary protein breakdown, alternative sources such as environmental contact, food additives, natural stimulants (coffee, tea), intake of herbal medicines, or addiction to psychedelic drugs may play a role in uremic toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many solutes with toxic capacity enter the body through the intestine. Changes in the composition of intestinal microbiota or changes in intestinal production, absorption, transfer, and metabolization may alter serum concentration of these toxins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some uremic solutes interfere with functions that directly affect the biochemical action of other solutes (eg, the expression of parathyroid hormone [PTH] receptors, the response to 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, as well as the protein binding and breakdown of several other solutes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with renal failure use multiple medications. Interference of drugs with protein binding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tubular secretion of uremic solutes influences their biological effect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipophilic compounds may be responsible at least in part for functional alterations in uremia; they are inadequately removed by current dialysis strategies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main strategy that has been used to decrease uremic solute concentration is dialysis. However, dialysis is nonspecific and also removes essential compounds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uremic solutes accumulate not only in the plasma but also in the cells, where most of the biological activity is exerted. Removal of intracellular compounds during dialysis through the cell membrane may be hampered, resulting in multicompartmental kinetics and inadequate detoxification, unless dialysis length <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frequency are increased.</p><p/><p>Lower morbidity and mortality are observed in patients submitted to long dialysis sessions, although the data mentioned have been obtained in an uncontrolled setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/309,310\" class=\"abstract_t\">309,310</a>]. A controlled trial demonstrated a positive impact of frequent nocturnal hemodialysis versus conventional dialysis on left ventricular mass and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/325\" class=\"abstract_t\">325</a>]. A randomized, controlled trial compared six times weekly to thrice-weekly hemodialysis over a 12-month follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/326\" class=\"abstract_t\">326</a>]. Six times weekly dialysis was associated with a decrease in the primary outcome, which was a composite of death or change in left ventricular mass, and with improved control of hypertension. Compounds may be cleared more efficiently with continuous or long-lasting low-efficiency strategies because removal is more gradual. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Biochemical alterations are provoked by a broad spectrum of compounds:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some are small and water soluble (eg, urea, the guanidines, phosphate, oxalate).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some are lipophilic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protein bound (eg, p-cresyl sulfate, 3-carboxy-4-metyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionic acid [CMPF], homocysteine [Hcy], indoles).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some are larger and in the middle-molecule range (eg, beta2-microglobulin [beta2-m], PTH, advanced glycosylation end products [AGEs]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some compounds from one group may impact generation and behavior of compounds from another group (eg, guanidines increasing generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p>Optimal removal for each type of molecule may be obtained with a different type of extracorporeal treatment (eg, by using large-pore membranes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dialyzers or devices with a high adsorptive capacity for some or several of the uremic toxins). Adsorption with the dialysis devices currently available is of little importance. More specific devices with large surface areas must be developed before adequate adsorption can be obtained.</p><p>Solute concentration is also influenced by intestinal intake and preservation of renal function:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal uptake can be reduced by influencing dietary uptake, by oral administration of sorbents, or by influencing intestinal flora by administration of prebiotics or probiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preservation of residual renal function may also be an important manner to pursue additional removal of retention solutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic intervention includes administration of drugs countering biological impact of uremic solutes and reaching a much larger population than with removal strategies.</p><p/><p>Finally, the choice of marker molecules for uremic retention and dialytic removal should be reconsidered. It has become increasingly evident that the current markers, which are all small, water-soluble compounds (urea, creatinine), are not always representative in their kinetic behavior for middle molecules, <span class=\"nowrap\">lipophilic/protein-bound</span> compounds, and even some other hydrosoluble compounds. On the other hand, it may be derisory to seek a marker that is representative for all solutes or even groups of solutes responsible for the uremic syndrome.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-toxins/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Vanholder R, De Smet R, Hsu C, et al.
