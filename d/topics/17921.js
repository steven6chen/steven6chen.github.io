Edematous patients generally respond to the combination of dietary sodium restriction and diuretic therapy, usually with a loop diuretic. Some patients, however, are resistant to this regimen.</p><p>A variety of factors can account for persistent fluid retention, including inadequate diuretic dose or frequency, excess sodium intake, delayed intestinal absorption of oral diuretics, decreased diuretic excretion into the urine, and increased sodium reabsorption at sites in the nephron other than those inhibited by the diuretic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which reduce the synthesis of vasodilator and natriuretic prostaglandins, can impair diuretic responsiveness. Thus, these agents should be discontinued, if possible, in edematous patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>The treatment of refractory edema in adults will be reviewed here.

There is minimal evidence of allergic cross-reactivity between sulfonamide antimicrobials and non-antimicrobials. Thus, patients with a history of allergy to sulfonamide antimicrobial drugs would be expected to tolerate non-antimicrobial sulfonamides such as loop diuretics. Allergic reactions that do occur appear to be related to a predisposition to allergic reactions rather than sulfonamide cross-reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

These issues, including diuretic-induced side effects and equivalency doses among the diuretics, are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loop-diuretics-maximum-effective-dose-and-major-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loop diuretics: Maximum effective dose and major side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Determine the effective dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diuretics have a dose-response curve, with no natriuresis seen until a threshold rate of drug excretion is attained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67654\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67654 \">figure 1</a>). If, for example, a patient does not respond to 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, the dose may not have exceeded this threshold. Thus, the single dose should be increased to 60 or 80 mg, rather than giving the 40 mg dose twice a day. Once a single effective dose has been determined, it should be administered multiple times per day, the frequency of which is individualized to the diuretic needs of the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loop-diuretics-maximum-effective-dose-and-major-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loop diuretics: Maximum effective dose and major side effects&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral versus intravenous therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with refractory edema have usually failed oral therapy. Some patients with severe or unstable heart failure require initial intravenous therapy, since decreased intestinal perfusion, reduced intestinal motility, and perhaps mucosal edema can reduce the rate of diuretic absorption and therefore reduce the rate of diuretic delivery into the tubular lumen by as much as 50 to 70 percent. This reduced delivery of diuretic into the renal tubule may be insufficient to cause natriuresis, as discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The defect in diuretic absorption is often reversible, resulting in more effective oral therapy following removal of some of the edema fluid with intravenous diuretics and stabilization of cardiac function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similar considerations may apply to patients with advanced cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A patient who is resistant to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> is not likely to respond to an equivalent intravenous dose of another loop diuretic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>. However, there are differences in bioavailability among the oral preparations of these drugs. Only about 50 to 60 percent of oral furosemide is absorbed. Absorption is well below this level in some edematous patients, and absorption may be erratic (range of bioavailability 10 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In such patients, apparent resistance to seemingly adequate doses of oral furosemide may be overcome by increasing the dose of furosemide or by switching to oral torsemide, which is more predictably absorbed (80 to 90 percent) than furosemide and has a longer half-life than furosemide or bumetanide.</p><p>The potential benefit of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a> therapy was illustrated in an open label, randomized trial in which 234 patients with chronic heart failure were treated with either oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> (average dose 136&plusmn;122 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or oral torsemide (average dose 72&plusmn;76 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The primary endpoint, readmission for heart failure at one year, was significantly lower with torsemide (17 versus 32 percent). Torsemide was also associated with a significant reduction in fatigue. Similarly, an analysis of the ASCEND-HF trial, in which 3,620 patients received furosemide and 557 received torsemide, reported a nonsignificant association of torsemide use with lower mortality and heart failure hospitalization at 30 days and lower mortality at 180 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF OTOTOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ototoxicity following the intravenous administration of loop diuretics is primarily manifested by decreased hearing, tinnitus, or deafness and is most likely to occur with high-dose bolus therapy in patients with renal insufficiency or heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The induction of hearing loss is thought to be related to the mechanism of action of loop diuretics. Transport in the loop of Henle that is mediated by a Na-K-2Cl cotransporter is inhibited by loop diuretics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanism of action of diuretics&quot;</a>). A secretory isoform of this cotransporter is present in the inner ear and plays an important role in the composition of endolymph. A mouse model in which this transporter was inactivated led to reduced endolymph secretion, structural damage to the inner ear, and deafness and imbalance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of dose and rate of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ototoxicity, which can lead to transient (most lasting 30 minutes to 24 hours) or permanent deafness, is primarily seen in patients treated with high intravenous or oral doses of loop diuretics. In a review of 29 cases of deafness associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> therapy that were reported to the Food and Drug Administration soon after the drug was approved, intravenous furosemide was administered in 17 patients, at an overall rate above 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min</span> (240 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/h),</span> with total doses given over one to nine days ranging in most patients from 200 mg to 21.6 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Therapy was usually more prolonged in patients treated with oral therapy (range 2 to 365 days), with doses ranging from 80 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p>The risk of ototoxicity is increased in patients with acute or chronic kidney disease or those taking other potential ototoxins such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethacrynic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethacrynic acid</a> or an aminoglycoside antibiotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As an example, deafness, which may be permanent, has been reported in patients with acute renal failure receiving the equivalent of 80 to 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/h</span> (2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, patients concurrently treated with an aminoglycoside may develop ototoxicity at lower loop diuretic doses.</p><p>When giving intravenous loop diuretics at high doses, the risk of ototoxicity may be reduced by a continuous intravenous infusion rather than bolus therapy. This was suggested in a randomized, crossover trial of 20 patients with severe heart failure who were treated with an eight-hour continuous infusion of high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> (250 to 2000 mg, mean 690 mg) or the same dose given as a single intravenous bolus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. All five episodes of reversible hearing loss occurred with bolus therapy, which was associated with a significantly higher maximum serum furosemide concentration (95 versus 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> with the continuous infusion).</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a subsequent meta-analysis of eight trials involving 254 patients with heart failure in whom a continuous infusion was associated with a significantly lower rate of ototoxicity, defined as hearing loss or tinnitus (relative risk 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

As the diuretic effect wanes, there is postdiuretic sodium retention due to the recovery of sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle plus continued increased sodium reabsorption at other sites in the nephron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Enhanced tubular sodium reabsorption'</a> below.)</p><p>If salt intake is high, postdiuretic sodium retention can counteract part or all of the diuresis that occurred while the diuretic was active. The postdiuretic effect is minimized with dietary salt restriction.</p><p>To estimate salt intake, a 24-hour urine should be collected in patients with refractory edema whose daily weight is stable or increasing. A value above 100 meq per day indicates that noncompliance with sodium restriction may be in part responsible for the apparent resistance to therapy.

As examples, decreased renal perfusion in heart failure (due to the reduced cardiac output) and cirrhosis (due to renal vasoconstriction) and competitive inhibition of tubular secretion in renal failure may contribute to impaired diuretic secretion.

Because loop diuretics are highly protein bound, severe hypoalbuminemia (&lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> associated with the nephrotic syndrome may reduce the delivery of diuretic to the renal tubule. In addition, filtered albumin in nephrotic patients may bind loop diuretics in the tubular lumen, thereby interfering with their function.

One concern with higher doses in general is possible ototoxicity, particularly with bolus therapy or concurrent administration of an aminoglycoside.</p><p>Bolus intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> doses of 160 to 200 mg (and equivalent doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>) occasionally cause transient tinnitus.

As noted, ototoxicity is most common when high doses of a loop diuretic are given rapidly at rates for furosemide above 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min</span>. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Importance of dose and rate of administration'</a> above.)</p><p>Application of the above intravenous doses to <strong>oral</strong> dosing varies among the loop diuretics. The dose should usually be doubled for oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, since its mean bioavailability is only about 50 percent. However, there is substantial interpatient and intrapatient variability in the bioavailability of oral furosemide, making it difficult to give a fixed ratio that would apply to all patients. A twofold higher dose than the intravenous dose is a reasonable starting point when switching to oral therapy, with further dose adjustments being determined by the diuretic response. In outpatients, the efficacy of therapy can be monitored by having daily weights called into the physician's office.</p><p>By contrast, the intravenous and oral doses are similar in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>, which have higher rates of oral bioavailability than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> (70 to 95 percent and 80 to 90 percent, respectively).

The physiologic rationale for a continuous intravenous infusion compared with bolus therapy is related to maintenance of an effective rate of drug excretion and therefore of inhibition of sodium chloride reabsorption in the loop of Henle over time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67654\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67654 \">figure 1</a>). By contrast, bolus therapy is associated with initially higher and then lower rates of diuretic excretion; as a result, sodium excretion may be at near maximal levels for the first two hours but then gradually falls until the next dose is given (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75714\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75714 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Importance of dose and rate of administration'</a> above.)</p><p>The efficacy of a continuous intravenous infusion compared with intravenous bolus therapy has been evaluated in randomized trials. A continuous intravenous infusion is safer (less ototoxicity) than bolus injections of loop diuretics but clear evidence of greater diuretic efficacy is lacking, at least in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The value of a continuous infusion of a loop diuretic compared to intermittent bolus injections was evaluated in a systematic review of eight trials that included 254 patients with ADHF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The urine output was significantly higher with a continuous infusion, although the difference was modest (mean difference 271 mL per 24 hours). However, the trials were small and heterogeneous and the apparent benefit was largely driven by a trial of 107 patients in which hypertonic saline was given only to patients receiving continuous therapy. Continuous infusion was associated with significantly lower rates of ototoxicity (tinnitus and hearing loss). The authors concluded that the available data were insufficient to permit definitive recommendations.

The trial randomly assigned 308 patients with ADHF to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> administered intravenously via either a bolus every 12 hours or continuous infusion and at either a low dose (equivalent to the patient's previous oral dose) or a high dose (2.5 times the previous oral dose). The efficacy endpoint was the global assessment of symptoms over the course of 72 hours and the safety endpoint was change in serum creatinine from baseline to 72 hours.

The risk of ototoxicity and other side effects associated with these infusion rates must be weighed against alternative strategies such as the addition of a thiazide-type diuretic or fluid removal via ultrafiltration, as described below. We do not recommend these higher doses.

Patients with heart failure, for example, cannot increase cardiac output normally with assumption of an upright position. As a result, renal perfusion and presumably urinary diuretic delivery further diminish. In addition, renal salt and water reabsorption increase.</p><p>The efficacy of assuming a supine position was evaluated in a randomized trial of six patients with heart failure and six with cirrhosis and ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. After staying in bed overnight, the patients were treated with 1 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a> intravenously and then assigned to either continued bed rest or normal daily activity for the next six hours. The procedure was repeated two days later when each patient was assigned to the opposite group. The supine position was associated with significantly higher mean creatinine clearance (100 versus 66 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> and diuretic response (1133 versus 626 mL at six hours). The upright position was associated with significant increases in plasma norepinephrine, renin, and aldosterone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Infusion with albumin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with hypoalbuminemia are relatively resistant to conventional diuretic therapy. It has been proposed that these patients may respond to the administration of 40 to 80 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> mixed with 6.25 to 12.5 g of salt-poor albumin. Infusion of the furosemide-albumin complex is thought to increase diuretic delivery to the kidney by keeping furosemide within the vascular space. In an initial report, this approach led to a substantial increase in sodium excretion in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>However, a subsequent study in patients with nephrotic syndrome (mean plasma albumin 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> found that a mixture of loop diuretic and albumin (60 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> infused in 200 mL of a 20 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albumin-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albumin solution</a>) produced only a modest increase in sodium excretion compared with furosemide alone without an increase in the rate of furosemide excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Furthermore, the increase in sodium excretion was roughly equivalent to the amount of sodium contained in the colloid solution, suggesting that volume expansion was a likely explanation for the enhanced natriuresis. Notably, no net sodium loss occurred. </p><p>A similar lack of efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> plus albumin infusion has been demonstrated in hypoalbuminemic patients with cirrhosis (mean plasma albumin 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Compared with furosemide alone, combination therapy did not increase the rate of either furosemide or sodium excretion.</p><p>Few patients with severe hypoalbuminemia (plasma albumin &lt;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> have been studied. It is possible that infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> or other loop diuretic plus albumin would be effective in patients with refractory edema and severe hypoalbuminemia. However, if attempted, sodium excretion should be monitored after addition of albumin infusions, and infusions should be discontinued if they do not result in a net increase in sodium excretion. General issues related to the management of edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-edema-in-patients-with-the-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and treatment of edema in patients with the nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Enhanced tubular sodium reabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients have partial or relatively complete resistance to a loop diuretic, despite adequate urinary delivery, as evidenced by a decreased natriuresis (compared with normals) at a given rate of diuretic excretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67654\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67654 \">figure 1</a>). This problem is often due to increased tubular sodium reabsorption in nephron segments other than the loop of Henle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>]. The decreased response to the action of a diuretic that results from increased sodium reabsorption in other nephron segments has been called the diuretic braking phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>This phenomenon may be mediated by sodium reabsorption in various other nephron segments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the proximal tubule, due to enhanced activity of angiotensin II and norepinephrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the distal tubule, due to flow-dependent hypertrophy resulting from chronic loop diuretic therapy, which increases sodium delivery and reabsorption in this segment.

One consequence of activating compensatory sodium-retaining mechanisms as soon as the extracellular fluid volume falls is that the maximum response to an intravenous diuretic occurs with the <strong>first dose</strong>, even with a continuous infusion, and the natriuresis begins to diminish within the first 12 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75714\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75714 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/1,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,24</a>].

The distal tubule reabsorbs about 75 to 80 percent of the sodium delivered out of the loop of Henle. Administration of a loop diuretic increases distal sodium delivery and therefore sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule, an effect mediated in part by increased activity of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter in the luminal membrane of the distal tubule cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>The efficacy of adding a thiazide diuretic was illustrated in a study of five patients who had an inadequate response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> in doses of 160 to 240 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (given in divided doses three to four times daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In such settings, it is reasonable to switch to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>, which is more predictably absorbed (80 to 90 percent) than furosemide and has a longer half-life than furosemide or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a>.

These defects in diuretic absorption are often reversible. Thus, oral diuretic therapy may become much more effective following removal of some of the edema fluid with intravenous diuretics. Patients who are treated with an intravenous diuretic because they have not responded to oral therapy can therefore be given a repeat trial of oral therapy once the edema has been reduced.

The nonsulfonamide diuretic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethacrynic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethacrynic acid</a> may be used in patients who are allergic to sulfonamide-based diuretics, but is not considered a first-line agent because it may be more ototoxic than the sulfonamide diuretics in high doses and its relative insolubility makes it difficult to administer intravenously. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Choice of diuretic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The basic approach to diuretic dosing includes determination of the minimum effective dose and selection of oral versus intravenous therapy.

Impaired diuretic secretion can be partially overcome using the maximum effective dose, which has been determined empirically. The increase in sodium reabsorption in nephron segments not inhibited by the loop diuretic may be overcome by repeating the diuretic dose twice or three times daily, providing the patient has at least a partial response to the diuretic, and by adding a thiazide diuretic.
