The inflammation primarily affects the columnar epithelial cells of the endocervical glands, but can also affect the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix. It may be due to an infectious or noninfectious etiology and may be acute or chronic. Acute cervicitis is usually due to infection (eg, chlamydia, gonorrhea), although a specific infection cannot be determined in a large proportion of cases. Chronic cervicitis usually has a noninfectious source. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19001095\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGNIFICANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical infection is clinically important because it can ascend and cause endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID); the pathogens involved can be transmitted to sexual partners; and, in pregnant women, it may cause pregnancy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neonatal complications as a result of infection of the fetus, placenta, amniotic fluid, decidua, or membranes. In addition, cervicitis appears to be associated with a significant increase in risk of HIV-1 acquisition and shedding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sequelae of PID include chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-complications-of-pelvic-inflammatory-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term complications of pelvic inflammatory disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19001049\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When an infectious etiology can be documented, Chlamydia trachomatis (typically serovars D-K) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the most common organisms identified, even though a relatively small proportion of women with these infections develop cervicitis. Chlamydial cervicitis occurs more often than gonococcal, and both primarily affect the columnar epithelium of the endocervix. </p><p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em> account for a few cases, but primarily affect the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix. Tuberculosis involves the cervix in a small proportion of women with tuberculous endometritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometritis-unrelated-to-pregnancy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometritis unrelated to pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Tuberculous endometritis'</a>). <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em> may be an important pathogen, as well; a recent meta-analysis reported that women with <em>M. genitalium</em> detected at the cervix had a significantly increased risk of cervicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. Bacterial vaginosis and streptococci (group A) have also been implicated as causative agents of acute cervicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Bacterial vaginosis is unlikely to be a cause of isolated cervicitis, without concurrent vaginal findings.</p><p><em>Mycoplasma hominis</em>, <em>Ureaplasma urealyticum</em>, and group B beta-hemolytic streptococci are commonly found in the genital tract, but there is little evidence that they cause cervicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Case reports have described cervicitis associated with other infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites).</p><p>There is no evidence that human papillomavirus infection (HPV) induces cervical inflammation, but it can cause other histologic changes (eg, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19001056\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninfectious causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninfectious cervicitis is usually caused by mechanical or chemical irritation. Sources of mechanical irritation include trauma from surgical instruments or foreign objects (eg, pessary, diaphragm, tampon, cervical cap). Chemical irritation can be caused by exposure to latex, vaginal douches, or contraceptive creams. Radiation therapy and systemic inflammatory disease (Beh&ccedil;et syndrome) are other noninfectious sources of cervicitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112758544\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant proportion of women with cervicitis are asymptomatic. Cervicitis in these women may be detected incidentally during physical examination. </p><p>When present, symptoms are often nonspecific. All women have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purulent or mucopurulent vaginal discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding</p><p/><p>Some women also have one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysuria, urinary frequency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspareunia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvovaginal irritation</p><p/><p>Urinary symptoms are generally due to concomitant urethral infection, which occurs in approximately 15 percent of women with cervical chlamydia infection.</p><p>Pain and fever are atypical in the absence of upper tract infection (endometritis, PID) or herpes simplex virus infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Purulent or mucopurulent discharge on the ectocervix <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exuding from the endocervical canal is a cardinal finding of acute cervicitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67848\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67848 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Minor trauma from insertion of a cotton or Dacron swab frequently precipitates bleeding (friability), and is another cardinal sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, the cervix may appear erythematous and edematous. On physical examination, the cervix may be tender to motion (a nonspecific sign suggestive of coexistent PID).</p><p>The cervical appearance varies, depending upon the severity of infection and the infecting organism. The quantity of cervical organisms correlates with the degree of inflammation. Mucopurulent cervical discharge, cervical friability, and edema in the zone of ectopy are characteristic of both gonococcal and chlamydial cervicitis. The presence of one or more of these signs is more predictive of gonorrhea or chlamydia infection in younger compared to older women (one in three women &lt;25 years infected versus 1 in 6 to 11 women &gt;25 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Diffuse vesicular <span class=\"nowrap\">lesions/ulceration</span> suggest HSV infection, while punctate hemorrhages (&quot;strawberry cervix&quot; or colpitis macularis) are characteristic of <em>T. vaginalis</em> infection; erosive inflammation and hemorrhagic lesions can occur with both infections. Primary HSV infection is often associated with systemic symptoms, as well. Subclinical HSV shedding is not typically associated with cervicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features of cervicitis caused by <em>M. genitalium</em> are not well-defined; some studies suggest that the majority of cervical infections with this possible pathogen do not elicit visible signs of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/5,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15,16</a>]. </p><p>It is not generally possible to distinguish infectious from noninfectious acute cervicitis by physical examination; the latter should be considered in women with persistent cervicitis despite antibiotic therapy.

This evaluation includes: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68759 \">table 1</a>). <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em> may cause isolated cervicitis; bacterial vaginosis typically affects the vagina. Either infection may occur concurrently with cervicitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial vaginosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excluding PID through bimanual examination of the pelvic organs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>We suggest nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em>. These assays can be performed on a swab of vaginal fluid, an endocervical sample (cells are obtained by rotating a swab within the endocervical canal while applying gentle lateral pressure) or, if a speculum examination is not possible, on urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Application of NAAT to these samples has excellent performance relative to that for direct endocervical sampling. A diagnostic test for <em>M. genitalium</em> is not FDA-cleared; however, some laboratories are able to perform NAAT for this organism (specifically transcription mediated amplification). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections#H22688671\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of chlamydial infections'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection in adults and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Microscopy (wet prep) and vaginal pH are useful for identifying bacterial vaginosis. </p><p>The sensitivity of microscopy to detect <em>T. vaginalis</em> is relatively low (approximately 50 percent), therefore, symptomatic women with cervicitis and negative microscopy for trichomonads should undergo further testing by culture, antigen-based methods, or ideally NAAT. NAAT offers a more sensitive means of detection than the other options and can be performed on the same screening specimen used for chlamydia and gonorrhea testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;, section on 'Rapid antigen and DNA hybridization probes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30962963\"><span class=\"h2\">Less useful - unnecessary tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A specimen for Gram's stain can be obtained by inserting a swab into the cervix after cleaning the ectocervix of discharge and mucus. The presence of &gt;10 polymorphonuclear cells per oil immersion field (ie, high power field) is indicative of mucopurulent cervicitis and suggests chlamydia or gonorrhea infection. However, this information is of limited value since a specific diagnosis requires identification of an organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Furthermore, sensitivity of Gram's stain for diagnosis of chlamydia or gonorrhea is low, the definition of a positive test has not been standardized, and it is difficult to ensure quality control. Sensitivity of Gram's stain for detection of endocervical gonococcal infection detected by culture or NAAT is only 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For these reasons, the Gram's stain is not recommended in routine clinical practice for evaluation of cervicitis. </p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Histopathology/cytology</span> is unnecessary in diagnostic evaluation of cervicitis. If performed, acute disease is characterized by stromal edema, vascular congestion, and a predominance of neutrophils in the inflammatory infiltrate. Chronic disease is characterized by an inflammatory infiltrate predominantly of round cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, histiocytes); squamous metaplasia is common and stromal fibrosis and granulation tissue may be present. </p><p>Routinely testing for infections other than <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and bacterial vaginosis is not useful unless a specific organism, such as herpes simplex virus, is suspected. There is generally no role for other bacterial cultures or PCR, which can be very costly and often detect vaginal bacteria that are unrelated to the cervical process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treatment are relief of symptoms and prevention of infection of the upper genital tract. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2014238\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with cervicitis should receive empiric antibiotic therapy at the time of initial evaluation, without waiting for results of laboratory tests, especially if follow-up is uncertain and if a relatively insensitive diagnostic test is used in place of NAAT. </p><p>The empiric treatment regimen for cervicitis should include coverage of chlamydia at a minimum (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and mycoplasma'</a> below), especially for women &le;25 years old, as the prevalence of this infection is highest in this age group. Other risk factors for chlamydia are history of a previous chlamydial infection in the prior several months, new or more than one sexual partner, and inconsistent use of condoms. </p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines recommend adding therapy for gonorrhea (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and mycoplasma'</a> below), as well, if either the individual patient's risk is high or if the local prevalence is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The threshold prevalence that defines &quot;high&quot; is not clear, but most experts agree that &gt;5 percent is reasonable, given the consequences of untreated infection and the ease with which treatment can be accomplished (ie, single-dose therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17</a>]. </p><p>Even for women who are not at apparently high risk for sexually transmitted infection, empiric antibiotic therapy for both chlamydia and gonorrhea is reasonable if patient follow-up of test results is a concern; the patient has risk factors for, or a recent history of, chlamydia or gonorrhea infection; or the local prevalence of gonorrhea or chlamydia infection is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>In general, patients and their sex partners should abstain from sexual intercourse until treatment has been completed (seven days after a single-dose regimen or after completion of a seven-day regimen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

For women with severe purulent vaginitis associated with a foreign body, we remove the foreign body and treat with antibiotic treatment (oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> or topical metronidazole or clindamycin), although there are no data to guide the choice of drug therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2014295\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic women with inflammation on histology or cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is not indicated for asymptomatic women who undergo cervical biopsy for the evaluation of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and are found to have histologic, but no clinical, evidence of cervicitis. Histological inflammation is a poor indicator of a specific infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although follicular cervicitis (lymphoid follicles beneath the epithelium) suggests, but is not pathognomonic of, chlamydial cervicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], follicular cervicitis can also occur with noninfectious cervicitis. Diagnostic testing is needed in these cases to confirm or exclude a specific infection and to guide treatment.</p><p>Inflammation on cervical cytology is also not an indication for treatment. The presence of a few lymphocytes on cytological smears is normal and should not be misdiagnosed as inflammation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients being evaluated for chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis should be offered counseling and testing for HIV and syphilis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Test of cure (performed at one month post-treatment) for chlamydia and gonorrhea is not required unless symptoms persist or the woman is pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, repeat testing three to six months after a diagnosis of either of these sexually transmitted infections is recommended, given high rates of recurrent infection documented in many populations. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21041321\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENT OR PERSISTENT DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervicitis can persist despite repeated courses of antimicrobial therapy. Women who present with recurrent symptoms are reevaluated for possible re-exposure or treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. We repeat the diagnostic work-up and ensure that (1) NAAT tests are negative for detection of <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, and (2) sex partners have been appropriately treated and the patient has not been re-exposed to potential pathogens. Diagnostic testing is performed for trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis. Exposure to potential intravaginal irritants (lubricants, spermicides, douching) is reassessed. If possible, sex partners should be examined and tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea, particularly if they were not treated presumptively at the time of the woman's initial treatment for cervicitis. </p><p>The role of <em>M. genitalium</em> in persistent cervicitis is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. <em>M. genitalium</em> is very difficult to culture; most studies have used nucleic acid amplification (PCR or, more recently, transcription mediated amplification [TMA]) for identification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/5,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15-17</a>]. Assays for this organism are not yet commercially available, and no testing guidelines exist. For these reasons, all women with persistent cervicitis should receive single-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (1 g orally once) if they have not already been treated with this agent, given its superiority over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> for treatment of <em>M. genitalium</em>. The optimal drug regimen for treatment of <em>M. genitalium</em> cervicitis that does not respond to azithromycin is unknown, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> is recommended in European guidelines for macrolide-resistant <em>M. genitalium</em> and by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for urethritis that does not respond to presumptive treatment for chlamydia and gonorrhea and may be due to <em>M. genitalium</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Multiple studies have suggested the potential for rapid emergence of macrolide resistance; thus patients requiring treatment with moxifloxacin for macrolide-resistant <em>M. genitalium</em> may become more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and mycoplasma'</a> above.)</p><p>For women with persistent cervicitis, some experts also advise additional coverage aimed at vaginal anaerobes (especially if bacterial vaginosis is present); one option is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> 500 mg orally twice daily for seven days. If cervicitis resolves, no further treatment is required.</p><p>Women whose cervicitis persists after these measures may require referral for ablative or excisional therapy. Some gynecologists have used electrocautery, laser, or shallow loop excision successfully to reduce persistent mucopurulent discharge unresponsive to prolonged antibiotic courses and for which an etiology has not been determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This is clearly a solution of last resort and it is imperative that malignancy be excluded by biopsy before any ablative treatment is undertaken.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112758137\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC CERVICITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic cervicitis usually has a noninfectious source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cervicitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In women with chronic cervicitis, the cervical mucosa is hyperemic and may be ulcerated. Obstruction of the mucous glands may result in formation of nabothian cysts. </p><p>A minority of women have mucopurulent endocervical discharge, which is more typical of acute infectious cervicitis, as described above. The term chronic in this context generally refers to women in whom the usual infectious causes of acute cervicitis noted above have been treated or excluded, yet abnormal physical signs persist.

Sexually transmitted infections are the most common cause; irritation from foreign bodies is another etiology. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> are the two most common causes of acute cervicitis. It is uncertain how much <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em> contributes to cervicitis, but this organism is likely responsible for a substantial minority of cases. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cardinal signs are purulent or mucopurulent discharge and easily induced bleeding (friability) from the endocervix. Associated symptoms include abnormal vaginal discharge, <span class=\"nowrap\">dysuria/urinary</span> frequency, and intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis of cervicitis is based upon the presence of mucopurulent cervical discharge and friability. Diagnostic evaluation for potential causative organisms includes assays for chlamydia and gonorrhea, as well as evaluation of vaginal fluid for trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest empiric therapy of cervicitis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This should include coverage for chlamydia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gonorrhea, depending on the patient&rsquo;s risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H2014238\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women in whom empiric therapy of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or both is deferred, the results of sensitive tests for <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> (eg, NAATs) should guide treatment. Testing for <em>M. genitalium</em> can be performed for women with persistent symptoms in the absence of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas infections. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and mycoplasma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment, follow-up, and management of sex partners depend upon the causative organism.
