Technical advances have enabled echocardiography to identify almost any anatomic or functional abnormality of the mitral valve. The appearance of the normal mitral valve and the more commonly encountered mitral valvular abnormalities will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL MITRAL VALVE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standard transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) examination of the mitral valve consists of an M-mode tracing, multiple 2D views, and Doppler flow evaluation. If clinically indicated (eg, technically difficult TTE or evaluation of prosthetic paravalvular leak), a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) may be performed. Together, these elements form an integrated examination of the mitral valve that can reliably define its function and evaluate the severity of abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Anatomically, the orientation of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve places this broad surface toward the anterior chest wall, making it an ideal sound reflecting target. Furthermore, because of its relatively large margin-to-base ratio, the anterior leaflet is highly mobile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57906\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57906 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The mitral valve can be recorded by ultrasound through a variety of anatomic windows in the precordium, apical, and subxiphoid regions, all of which should be used in its examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">M-mode echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The M-mode examination is performed from the precordium and guided from the 2D long and short axis views. Normally, the anterior mitral leaflet exhibits a motion pattern that reflects the phasic nature of ventricular filling and produces a familiar M-shaped pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67656\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67656 \">figure 3</a>). The posterior leaflet moves in a nearly mirror image &quot;W&quot; pattern with a smaller excursion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial large opening diastolic movement of the valve, which culminates in the E-point, is the result of rapid left ventricular (LV) filling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The valve assumes a nearly closed position during the middle of diastole (F point), reflecting the deceleration of inflow as the pressure gradient between atrium and ventricle is reduced. On the M-mode echocardiogram, this early diastolic closure is measured as the E-F slope, which is usually &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/sec</span>.</p><p/><p>During this mid-diastolic phase, in spite of the appearance of closure, there continues to be flow of blood from pulmonary veins to the LV. This period of filling is known as the conduit phase because the atrium briefly functions as a passive channel rather than a reservoir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following atrial contraction, the valve opens for a second time (A point), completing the second peak of the letter M.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Final closure is probably the combined effect of deceleration of atrial inflow and isometric LV contraction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Two-dimensional echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2D appearance of the normal mitral valve on TTE depends somewhat upon the imaging plane from which it is viewed. In the parasternal short axis plane, the valve presents itself as an ovoid (fish mouth) orifice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68826\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68826 \">image 1</a>), while in parasternal long axis and apical views, it resembles clapping hands, with the anterior hand longer and more mobile than the posterior (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77446%7ECARD%2F75034\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77446 graphicRef75034 \">image 2A-B</a>). In general, the normal mitral valve should appear as a mobile, two leaflet structure that moves freely enough to respond to the normal flux of diastolic filling but forms a stable coaptation plane in systole without breaking the plane defined by the mitral annulus and entering the body of the left atrium.</p><p>Anatomically, the mitral valve leaflets are thin and translucent; the rough attachment points of its chordae to their free margins are thicker than their smooth bellies. The chordae from each leaflet connect to both papillary muscles. On M-mode, each leaflet is represented by no more than two linear echoes. On 2D imaging, the valve appears homogeneous and thin, &lt;4 mm in thickness. However, the perception of leaflet thickness also depends upon the transducer frequency.</p><p>Many sonographers prefer 2.5 mHz for imaging because it allows adequate images in difficult patients and is superior for Doppler flow. At this lower frequency, some normal valves can appear mildly thickened. For this reason, if an abnormality is suspected, the valve should be imaged with a higher frequency before being designated as &quot;thickened.&quot; In order to exclude valve pathology, fundamental (non-harmonic) imaging at 3.5 mHz or higher should be used. As a general rule, when imaged fundamentally, a normal mitral valve is thinner than a normal aortic root imaged under the same conditions.</p><p>Other anatomic features of the mitral apparatus that are appreciated on 2D echocardiographic examination include the papillary muscles, chordae, and the mitral annulus.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The papillary muscles can be seen in the parasternal short axis at approximately four o'clock (anterolateral) and eight o'clock (posteromedial) orientations, and their fine anatomy is highly variable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mitral annulus is receiving increasing attention because three-dimensional (3D) imaging has revealed it to be highly dynamic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. On 2D imaging, the examination is limited to measuring the diameter of the mitral annulus and inspecting it for calcification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60748\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60748 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61639\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61639 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56296\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef56296 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Mitral leaflet anatomy can be identified by location on standard imaging views. In the parasternal long axis, the A2 and P2 segments are visualized. A1 and P1 segments are adjacent to the left atrial appendage, which is seen on the right side of the image in the standard parasternal short-axis view (with the near field at the top of the image). In the two-chamber view, segments P1, A2, and P3 are visualized from right to left in transthoracic image, with P1 adjacent to the inferior annulus. By TEE in the zero-degree plane, A1 and P1 are seen first as the probe is advanced; with deeper insertion, A2 and P2 come into view, and subsequently A3 and P3 are visualized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Doppler echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler examination of the normal mitral valve reveals that the velocity pattern of blood entering the LV during diastole closely resembles the M-shaped pattern of the M-mode of that structure; blood flow is most rapid during the early (E) phases of filling, falls to very low levels during the mid-diastolic conduit phase, and accelerates again during atrial (A) contraction. Transmitral flow is sampled from the apical four chamber view; the sampling site used to obtain this signal is the space between the tips of the open mitral valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59321\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef59321 \">waveform 2</a>). When transmitral flow is used to quantitate flow volume, the sample volume is placed in the mitral annulus. The normal peak flow velocity across the mitral valve is usually just under 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> and the normal mitral valve area is 4 to 6 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Many measurements are derived from the transmitral wave form. The most reliable and relevant measurements are the ratio of the E to A waves, the isovolemic relaxation time, and the deceleration time. These values give insight into diastolic function and into the function of the valve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109550740\"><span class=\"h2\">Three-dimensional echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional echocardiography has improved the understanding of the anatomy and function of the hyperbolic paraboloid mitral valve. Three-dimensional TTE image acquisition is performed from the parasternal and apical views, using zoomed or full-volume feature. Changing the display enables visualization of the mitral valve from either the LV or the left atrium (&quot;surgical&quot;) perspective and allows for precise lesion localization. Additionally, 3D echocardiography allows for accurate LV measurements as it avoids LV foreshortening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Subvalvular apparatus can be seen from the LV perspective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Three-dimensional TEE has superior resolution compared with 3D TTE and is a critical aid in percutaneous mitral valve repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2315453828\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of cardiac magnetic resonance in mitral regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can be clinically useful in the assessment of mitral regurgitation, including identifying the mechanism of mitral regurgitation, quantifying its severity, and determining its cardiac consequences including LV and left atrial volumes. Several studies have compared CMR with TTE in the assessment of mitral regurgitation and have found a role for CMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, CMR and echocardiographic findings can be discordant, and an integrated approach should be used with caution. In instances where CMR and echocardiographic findings are discrepant, careful history and auscultation may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MITRAL VALVE LESIONS CAUSING INFLOW OBSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common lesion of the mitral valve that causes inflow obstruction is mitral stenosis, which is usually acquired as the result of rheumatic heart disease. Less common causes include left atrial myxoma and other tumors, severe mitral annular calcification, left-sided carcinoid heart disease, and congenital disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic mitral stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carcinoid-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carcinoid heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitral stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In mitral stenosis, the normal, rapid, biphasic motion of the valve is altered because the valve opens only partly and as a single unit. Anatomically, the commissural separation between the anterior and posterior or mural leaflets is diminished by partial fusion and the subvalvular apparatus is altered by chordal foreshortening. Immobility of the posterior leaflet is a common early finding with a &quot;hockey <span class=\"nowrap\">stick/knee</span> bend&quot; appearance to the anterior mitral leaflet due to leaflet tethering. Doming of the anterior leaflet corresponds temporally to the opening snap on auscultation.</p><p>These changes cause a limiting orifice that obstructs diastolic transit of blood from atrium to ventricle. One hemodynamic consequence of this alteration is a holodiastolic pressure gradient between the left atrium and left ventricle (LV).</p><p>Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can identify the pathologic entity of mitral stenosis and quantitate its severity with sufficient accuracy to make reliable decisions about the suitability for catheter-based balloon valvotomy or the need for surgery. Quantitation of mitral stenosis severity can be accomplished by direct methods and its qualitative estimation by a number of indirect observations.</p><p>The 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> guideline for valvular heart disease gave a Class I recommendation for the use of TTE in diagnosing the presence and evaluating the severity of mitral stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">M-mode echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>M-mode confirmation of the altered pattern of mitral motion in mitral stenosis remains a useful tool. Mitral stenosis alters the appearance of the M-mode tracing of the mitral valve so that its normal early diastolic closure is delayed or abolished. The early diastolic closure slope, the E-F slope, produces an easily recognized pattern and can also be quantitated to separate normal atrial inflow from obstructed and to differentiate among the degrees of obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73666%7ECARD%2F57949%7ECARD%2F65631\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73666 graphicRef57949 graphicRef65631 \">figure 4A-C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50915\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef50915 \">movie 1</a>). Although this method is the least reliable means of quantitating the severity of obstruction, a slope of less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/sec</span> (normal is &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/sec)</span> from a valve recording made during suspended respiration is evidence for severe mitral stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In normal valves, the posterior leaflet moves in a mirror image pattern to the anterior; in mitral stenosis, the posterior leaflet moves forward in diastole, paralleling the anterior. Reversal of diastolic motion from the normal pattern makes the M-mode of the posterior leaflet one of the most valuable means of identifying mitral stenosis. </p><p>The opening snap (OS) of the mitral valve coincides with the initial peak opening (E) of the valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73087\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73087 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Two-dimensional TTE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitral stenosis alters the appearance of the valve on 2D echocardiography because it partially fuses the normally independent leaflets and creates a persistent gradient between the LV and left atrium. This gradient keeps the stenotic diastolic orifice opened to its maximum and causes the entire valve to dome or bulge into the ventricle throughout diastole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71983\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71983 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78565\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef78565 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62748\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef62748 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71501\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef71501 \">movie 4</a>). The elevated gradient initiates the opening motion in an abrupt manner, generating the opening snap and a characteristic &quot;knee bend&quot; appearance on the precordial long axis view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73951\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73951 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76132\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76132 \">movie 5</a>).</p><p>In the parasternal short axis plane, the opening of the valve can be imaged just above the tips of the papillary muscles. From this orientation, its maximum diastolic opening area can be measured by direct planimetry of the 2D image. This method is a reliable means of judging the severity of obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. A mitral valve area (MVA) of less than 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> is considered severe, regardless of the method used to calculate its size.</p><p>Other features of mitral stenosis on the 2D echocardiogram include chordal foreshortening and atrial thrombi; the latter are rarely seen in echocardiograms taken from the precordial windows.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Doppler echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler methods provide a constellation of measurements by which the severity of mitral stenosis is gauged. These variables include the gradient across the valve at rest and with exercise, the inferred area by the pressure half-time method, the continuity equation or the proximal flow convergence method, and the pulmonary pressure at rest and during exercise from the tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>Doppler methods can measure the velocity of mitral inflow. In mitral stenosis, this velocity increases at rest from a normal value of less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> to greater than 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span>. The algorithm to convert Doppler velocity into pressure gradient is the modified Bernoulli equation. The peak gradient between two reservoirs connected by a narrow orifice or pipe (in this case the LV and the left atrium connected by the stenotic mitral valve) can be calculated by the modified Bernoulli formula, taking the square of the peak velocity of fluid flowing between them (in this case, blood) and multiplying by four (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68524\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef68524 \">movie 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52554\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef52554 \">movie 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52855\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef52855 \">waveform 3</a>).</p><p> &#160;Peak gradient, in mmHg &#160;= &#160;4 &#160;x &#160;peak velocity(2)</p><p>Thus, a peak velocity of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> indicates a peak gradient of 4 mmHg; a peak velocity of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> indicates a peak gradient of 16 mmHg; 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> indicates a peak gradient of 36 mmHg.</p><p>The mean transmitral gradient can be measured by tracing the area-under-the-curve of the mitral E and A waves obtained by continuous wave Doppler. With severe mitral stenosis, the mean transmitral gradient is &gt;10 mmHg in sinus rhythm at heart rates between 60 and 80 bpm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The most frequently used measurement for the determination of the mitral valve area is the pressure half-time, which is derived from hemodynamic data (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65636%7ECARD%2F64364\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65636 graphicRef64364 \">figure 5A-B</a>). The pressure half-time is the time required for the gradient between the left atrium and the LV to fall to one-half of its initial value. In order to convert Doppler velocity into a pressure gradient, the initial flow velocity is divided by 1.41 (square root of 2), because velocity bears a second order relationship to pressure. Empirically, a pressure half-time of 220 msec is equivalent to a valve area of 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>; therefore:</p><p>MVA &#160;= &#160;220 &#160;&divide; &#160;pressure half-time</p><p>Calculating the MVA using the pressure half-time may be an inaccurate approach whenever abrupt changes in the transmitral gradient occur for reasons other than inflow obstruction. An example of such a change is additional ventricular filling from aortic regurgitation.</p><p>Among the methods for estimating rheumatic mitral stenosis severity, direct planimetry of the orifice is probably the most accurate when performed correctly with good image quality and without severe distortion of valve anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, in a clinical setting, limitations are frequently present and it is the universal practice to achieve cross validation by applying the full array of methods.</p><p>Indirect methods to identify the severity of mitral stenosis include observing the degree of foreshortening of the chordae tendineae, estimating the extent of leaflet calcification, noting the degree of left atrial enlargement, noting the degree of LV underloading (ie, volume decrease), noting the presence of right ventricular and atrial dilatation, and noting the degree of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension, as determined by Doppler of tricuspid regurgitant jet.</p><p>The 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> guideline for valvular heart disease defined severe mitral stenosis as having an MVA &le;1.5 cm<sup>2 </sup>(MVA &le;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> with very severe MS) and diastolic pressure half-time &ge;150 ms (diastolic pressure half-time &ge;220 ms with very severe MS), along with severe left atrial enlargement and pulmonary artery systolic pressure &gt;30 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97546\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97546 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Stress echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Documentation of elevation of transmitral gradient and pulmonary pressure during exercise is useful in patients whose symptoms do not seem concordant with the degree of mitral stenosis at rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

However, these jets are very sensitive to instrument settings, and the size of a color jet may be misleading; thus, reliance on these size judgments alone is imprudent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the ventricular side of the valve, proximal flow acceleration (proximal isovelocity surface area or PISA) is seen as a concentric series of hemispheric shells of alternating colors, each shell denoting an isovelocity of aliasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Once entrained on the wall, the jet may completely circle the chamber. The jet also tends to penetrate the atrial appendage and one or more of the pulmonary veins. The color flow pattern in the receiving chamber is agitated and multidirectional, and spontaneous contrast is absent. During most of the jet's passage around the atrium, it is broad and aliased. It must be emphasized that any aliased (mosaic) wall hugging jet, however small in apparent area, should be considered to potentially represent severe mitral regurgitation. Generally, milder degrees of mitral regurgitation are associated with central jets that lose their mosaic pattern before reaching the atrial wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some researchers have found the jet area in the left atrium on TEE to be a useful guide to mitral regurgitation severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, since the entire left atrium cannot be seen at one time, the measurement of total jet size is problematic. Furthermore, careful study of most jets with appropriate frame rates reveals that they are not central jets but entrained wall jets, which do not lend themselves to &quot;jet area measurement.&quot; We do not endorse this method.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulsed and continuous wave Doppler of mitral inflow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spectral Doppler (pulsed and continuous wave) recognition of severe mitral regurgitation also has many diagnostic features.

This pattern is identical to the restrictive inflow pattern and has a similar origin, in that filling pressures may be elevated in both situations. Finding an A-wave dominant pattern of mitral inflow makes severe mitral regurgitation very unlikely.</p><p>Several features of the continuous wave Doppler systolic patterns of regurgitant mitral flow support the presence of severe mitral regurgitation. Because density of the continuous wave jet is proportional to the number of red blood cells reflecting sound, severe mitral regurgitation usually has a dense continuous wave jet. However, it is important to note that jet density is gain dependent. In addition, eccentric jets can be less dense even though the regurgitation is severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. If the flow signal can be aligned parallel to the beam, the jet will appear uniformly dense throughout its duration, have a well-defined envelope, and may, in its late phases, show evidence of a &quot;v-wave cut-off sign.&quot; This sign results from a rapid decrease in ventriculoatrial gradient as the large volume of regurgitant blood abruptly raises pressure in the left atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51062\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51062 \">waveform 5</a>).</p><p>In severe decompensated mitral regurgitation, the tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity is often increased as the result of pulmonary hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Quantitative parameters of mitral regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using the PISA method and various volumetric methods, quantitative measures including regurgitant volume, regurgitant fraction, and effective regurgitation orifice area (EROA) can be calculated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Color flow imaging displays the convergence signal known as PISA as a hemispheric shell with surface velocity equal to the chosen aliasing velocity (Va) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. At a given aliasing velocity, the radius (r) of PISA increases with increasing regurgitant volume.

On 2D echocardiography, there is shortening of the mitral valve apparatus, resulting in failure of the leaflets to close properly or completely; the leaflets often do not reach the level of the mitral annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Patients with ischemic heart disease may also have mitral regurgitation from annular dilatation (functional mitral regurgitation). A 3D echocardiographic study suggested that it may be possible to differentiate ischemic mitral regurgitation from functional mitral regurgitation in DCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The pattern of mitral valve deformation was asymmetric in the ischemic mitral regurgitation and symmetric in functional mitral regurgitation; in addition, the LV chamber and mitral annulus were less enlarged in ischemic MR. In this review, we have not used the term &quot;papillary muscle dysfunction&quot; because we believe it to be anachronistic and uninformative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of chronic secondary mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">Rheumatic mitral regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rheumatic mitral regurgitation is often associated with some degree of mitral stenosis, and the valve area is usually sufficiently reduced to alter its echocardiographic appearance and sufficiently narrowed to separate it readily from normal even when stenosis is minimal. The scarring associated with the rheumatic process usually results in characteristic alterations of valve motion (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Mitral stenosis'</a> above) on the M-mode echocardiogram.</p><p>On 2D imaging, failure of coaptation can also be seen during systole on a short axis image; its extent is proportional to the severity of regurgitation. Rheumatic mitral regurgitation is the only form of insufficiency to have been quantitated by failure of coaptation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61901\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61901 \">image 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4084071644\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
