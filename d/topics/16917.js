Hair loss in telogen effluvium occurs as a result of an abnormal shift in follicular cycling that leads to the premature shedding of hair.</p><p>A wide variety of endogenous and exogenous factors have been linked to the induction of telogen effluvium. Examples include major surgery, serious illness, childbirth, protein or caloric malnutrition, drugs, and severe emotional distress. In some cases, the inciting cause is unclear or multiple inciting triggers are identified.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of telogen effluvium will be reviewed here. An overview of the evaluation of patients with scalp hair loss is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1164291211\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on the epidemiology of telogen effluvium are limited. The disorder is one of the most common forms of nonscarring hair loss for which patients present for clinical evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Telogen effluvium does not appear to have a predilection for particular racial or ethnic groups. </p><p>Most experts divide telogen effluvium into acute and chronic variants. Acute telogen effluvium may occur at any age, including infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. For unclear reasons, women are more likely to present for evaluation of acute telogen effluvium than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Chronic telogen effluvium is much less common than the acute variant, and is most frequently diagnosed in women between the ages of 30 and 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Chronic telogen effluvium can further be subdivided into chronic and chronic-repetitive clinical presentations. (See <a href=\"#H1164291232\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1164291218\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The excessive hair shedding that characterizes telogen effluvium occurs as a result of altered regulation of the hair follicle growth cycle. Normally, each follicle on the human scalp cycles independently through three major phases: anagen (growth), catagen (transformation), and telogen (rest). The end of the four to six week telogen phase is marked by the shedding of hair from the follicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H1871661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Hair cycle'</a>.)</p><p>The asynchronous cycling of scalp hair follicles in humans prevents periodic episodes of mass shedding of hair. Rather, shedding of hair occurs on a continuous basis. In the absence of scalp or hair disorders, 50 to 150 hairs typically are shed each day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Telogen effluvium occurs when the proportion of hair follicles in the telogen phase increases significantly, resulting in subsequent prominent shedding of hair. On the normal human scalp, only about 10 percent of follicles are in the telogen phase at any given time, while anagen and catagen follicles account for approximately 90 and &lt;1 percent of follicles, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In telogen effluvium, it is estimated that 7 to 35 percent of the follicles that normally would have remained in the anagen phase shift into the telogen phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91936243\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of hair loss in telogen effluvium is not completely understood. It is generally accepted that an identifiable or occult, physiologic event stimulates a change in follicular cycling due to an insult to the anagen bulb (one of the two hair growth centers). Several theories of the mechanism of hair loss have been proposed, some of which have been associated with specific stimuli for telogen effluvium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Immediate anagen release and delayed anagen release are the most commonly cited theories: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immediate anagen release </strong>&ndash; Immediate anagen release may be a common mechanism for telogen effluvium. According to this theory, a significant proportion of anagen follicles are stimulated to enter telogen prematurely. Immediate anagen release may be the primary mechanism for telogen effluvium related to physiologic stress (eg, high fever) or drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delayed anagen release </strong>&ndash; The theory of delayed anagen release describes prolongation of the duration of anagen, thereby delaying the onset of telogen. Hair loss is noted once the stimulus for sustaining anagen ends and the affected follicles enter telogen and subsequently shed. Delayed anagen release may be the primary mechanism for postpartum telogen effluvium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>].</p><p/><p>Additional theories for the mechanism of telogen effluvium have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. Abnormal shortening of the anagen phase could contribute to an increase in hair shedding by augmenting the proportion of follicles in the telogen phase. In addition, shortening of the telogen phase could lead to the simultaneous release of hair from a large proportion of telogen follicles (immediate telogen release). Reduced variance in the duration of anagen has been proposed as a mechanism of chronic telogen effluvium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Last, a delay in telogen release could lead to an increase in hair shedding due to the sudden release of hairs from follicles that were stimulated to remain in the telogen phase for an extended period. Delayed telogen release may account for seasonal fur shedding in mammals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1164291225\"><span class=\"h2\">Inciting factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide variety of factors have been associated with the induction of telogen effluvium based upon clinical observations. However, data to confirm and define the level of risk for telogen effluvium related to these factors are lacking. It is estimated that in approximately one-third of patients with acute telogen effluvium, an inciting factor cannot be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The cause of chronic telogen effluvium usually is more difficult to identify, but careful history taking can be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H1164291246\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>Potential inciting factors for telogen effluvium include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute or chronic major illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collagen vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Febrile illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Childbirth (telogen gravidarum)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein or caloric dietary restriction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron deficiency anemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital or acquired zinc deficiency (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dietary-trace-minerals#H62\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dietary trace minerals&quot;, section on 'Deficiency'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrine disorders (eg, hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs, supplements, or toxins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91674\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91674 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant emotional stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory conditions of the scalp (eg, seborrheic dermatitis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious conditions that affect the scalp (eg, fungal, bacterial, viral, or spirochetal)</p><p/><p>The relationship between serum levels of ferritin or vitamin D and telogen effluvium is controversial. Studies evaluating the relationship between serum ferritin levels and telogen effluvium have yielded conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/15-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-23</a>], contributing to continued uncertainty about a relationship between these conditions as well as the value of iron supplementation in non-anemic patients (see <a href=\"#H20017081\" class=\"local\">'Supplements'</a> below). Although a link between vitamin D status and hair loss has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], additional studies are necessary to determine whether vitamin D status plays a role in telogen effluvium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1164291232\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major clinical finding in telogen effluvium is an acute or chronic reduction in scalp hair density. Less than 50 percent of scalp hair is typically lost. Therefore, progression to complete balding does not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Because only a portion of the hair is lost, the severity of hair loss may not be readily apparent in patients with a history of voluminous hair prior to the onset of telogen effluvium. In such cases, the patient history and viewing of prior photographs may provide the clinician with a clearer idea of the change in hair density.</p><p>The progression of telogen effluvium typically follows one of two courses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91675 \">figure 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute telogen effluvium </strong>&ndash; Telogen hair loss develops within two to three months after the inciting factor, and reverses once the inciting factor is eliminated. The time for clinically relevant hair regrowth is between 6 to 12 months, since length of hair is important for the perception of regrowth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic telogen effluvium </strong>&ndash; Idiopathic condition in which telogen hair loss persists for <strong>more than</strong> four to six months; some patients develop a chronic-repetitive pattern of telogen effluvium in which chronic telogen effluvium is punctuated by additional episodes of acute hair loss as a result of multiple intermittent triggers. </p><p/><p>The distribution of scalp hair loss in telogen effluvium typically is diffuse; however, hair loss may be most noticeable in the bitemporal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76636\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76636 \">picture 1</a>), frontal, and vertex areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A patchy, or &quot;moth-eaten&quot; pattern of hair loss is often evident in syphilis-related telogen effluvium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52213\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52213 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p>In the absence of a concomitant hair or scalp disorder, the scalp and hair shafts appear normal, with normal variation in hair shaft diameters, and symptoms are absent. In addition to the scalp, telogen effluvium may affect other hair-bearing areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/10,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,24</a>]. </p><p>Hair loss due to telogen effluvium may lead to the recognition of a preexisting hair loss disorder that was not as obvious previously. For example, this may occur in patients with early stage male or female androgenetic alopecia or central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Androgenetic alopecia in men: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia in women): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91936450\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the exception of telogen effluvium induced by inflammatory disorders that affect the scalp, such as seborrheic dermatitis, scalp biopsies from patients with telogen effluvium do not demonstrate inflammation. An increased proportion of telogen follicles is the key histopathologic finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Unlike androgenetic alopecia, the proportion of vellus hair follicles is not increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Because of the absence of increased vellus hair follicles, variation in hair shaft diameters is much less than that observed in androgenetic alopecia.</p><p>Patients with telogen effluvium induced by inflammation in the scalp, such as may occur in seborrheic dermatitis or syphilis, will demonstrate an increased proportion of telogen follicles as well as histopathologic findings consistent with the inciting disorder. As an example, biopsies of syphilitic alopecia usually demonstrate lymphoplasmacytic, perivascular, and perifollicular infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seborrheic-dermatitis-in-adolescents-and-adults#H34051788\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seborrheic dermatitis in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Histopathology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1164291246\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of telogen effluvium can usually be made based upon the patient history, physical examination, and a hair pull test. The recognition of diffuse, noninflammatory, nonscarring hair loss should raise clinical suspicion for telogen effluvium, particularly when it occurs acutely and is preceded by a physiologic or psychologic stressor. A scalp biopsy is not necessary in most cases. (See <a href=\"#H1164291232\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91936318\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient history is of great value in the evaluation of the patient with suspected telogen effluvium. A thorough patient history confirms a course of hair loss consistent with telogen effluvium, may reveal the underlying cause(s) of telogen effluvium, and is useful for ruling out other causes of hair loss. In older adult patients or other patients with multiple medical disorders, the cause of telogen effluvium may be multifactorial.

Scale, inflammation, pustules, and scarring are not features of isolated telogen effluvium. The detection of such findings suggests the presence of a different (or concomitant) scalp disorder. Abnormalities of the hair shaft also are not features of telogen effluvium. If many broken hairs are visualized in a patient with a complaint of hair loss, the clinician should consider the possibility of heat or chemical-related damage to the hair shaft, trichotillomania, or a structural hair disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H638369\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Scalp and hair examination'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the entire skin surface should be examined to identify the extent of hair loss and to detect features of other hair or scalp disorders. Examination of the nails should be performed and may offer clues to the cause of telogen effluvium. As examples, Beau lines in the nails suggest the recent occurrence of a significant medical illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78502%7EDERM%2F85706\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78502 graphicRef85706 \">picture 3A-B</a>), and patients with iron deficiency anemia may demonstrate koilonychia (nail &quot;spooning&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86419\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86419 \">picture 4</a>).

The test aids in the recognition of active hair shedding. We grasp 50 to 60 hair fibers close to the skin surface and tug the hairs from the proximal to distal ends. The extraction of more than six to ten hair fibers is abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. We repeat the pull test in several areas of the scalp. Examination of the hair shafts with a light microscope is then used to confirm that the loose hairs are telogen hairs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50528 \">figure 2</a>).

To perform a hair collection, we instruct patients to collect hair that sheds during morning hair grooming each day for two weeks. Hair loss of greater than 100 to 150 hairs per day is consistent with an effluvium. The collected hairs can be examined under a microscope to confirm that they are telogen hairs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1164291260\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of laboratory work-up of patients with telogen effluvium is to identify an underlying cause.

However, no high quality studies have evaluated the use of iron supplementation in non-anemic patients with telogen effluvium, and the value of iron supplementation in this population is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H20017081\" class=\"local\">'Supplements'</a> below.)</p><p>The selection of additional laboratory studies is guided by the need to rule out disorders in the differential diagnosis or to further investigate patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of a particular underlying disease. As examples, a hormonal work-up to rule out hair loss related to hyperandrogenemia would be appropriate in women with signs of virilization, acne, and obesity, and further evaluation with an ANA or other studies would be appropriate for a patient with signs or symptoms of an underlying autoimmune disease.

Exclamation point hairs (short, 1 to 3 mm hairs with a tapered base) that result from dystrophic hair growth are a common finding. Microscopic evaluation of the proximal ends of hairs dislodged during a hair pull test demonstrates normal or dystrophic anagen hairs rather than telogen hairs.

A biopsy can be useful for differentiating between these diagnoses in difficult cases. Of note, the two conditions may coexist, and telogen hair shedding can occur early in the course of androgenetic alopecia.

Similar to anagen effluvium, exclamation point hairs may be present and performance of the hair pull test may reveal dystrophic anagen hairs. A biopsy revealing an inflammatory infiltrate consistent with alopecia areata differentiates this condition from telogen effluvium.

For example, treatment for an associated illness or dietary deficiency can be implemented. If drug-induced telogen effluvium is suspected, the suspect drug must be discontinued for at least three months to determine whether hair loss will improve off therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Thus, consideration of the patient's emotional well-being is an important component of patient management. The patient's concerns should be addressed by the clinician in a sensitive manner. In addition, education about the hair growth cycle and the expected course of telogen effluvium (including an explanation that complete hair loss is not expected to occur), may help to reassure patients. Follow-up evaluations can be helpful for reassuring the patient as well as for identifying patients who require further evaluation because of persistent telogen effluvium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91936586\"><span class=\"h2\">Other interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> and a variety of nutritional supplements in telogen effluvium is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91936564\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical minoxidil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> is primarily used for the treatment of male and female androgenetic alopecia.

Minoxidil 2% is applied twice daily to the entire scalp while 5% is usually used once per day. The effects of minoxidil on hair growth are not evident immediately; we suggest a full year of use prior to concluding that minoxidil is ineffective. Treatment must be continued indefinitely to maintain benefit. In our opinion, minoxidil is not helpful for telogen effluvium that is expected to resolve spontaneously or that has an inciting cause that can be eliminated.</p><p>Of note, occasionally increased hair shedding has been observed within the first two to eight weeks of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> in patients treated for androgenetic alopecia. This is thought to result from the release of hairs from telogen follicles as they are stimulated by minoxidil to transition from telogen to anagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>]. A telogen effluvium frequently follows the cessation of topical minoxidil in patients with androgenetic alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20017081\"><span class=\"h3\">Supplements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is well accepted that patients in whom iron deficiency anemia is detected should receive iron supplementation, the use of iron supplementation for the treatment of telogen effluvium in the absence of iron deficiency or iron storage anemia is controversial. Supplementing iron intake to reach ferritin levels greater than 30, 40, or 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> in patients with hair loss has been recommended by some experts based upon a belief that treatment for hair loss is optimized at greater serum ferritin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/1,17,21,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17,21,34</a>]. In one small placebo-controlled randomized trial of 12 women with chronic telogen effluvium who were treated with iron and lysine supplements (n = 5) or placebo (n = 7) for six months, a 31 percent reduction in the proportion of hairs in the telogen phase was detected in the treatment group, compared with a 9 percent increase in the proportion of telogen hairs in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Based upon personal clinical experience that suggests benefit, the author routinely prescribes dietary modification or oral iron supplementation for patients with telogen effluvium to obtain and maintain serum levels of ferritin well within the reference range of the assay used at her institution (at least 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span>. Of note, ferritin reference ranges are assay-specific. Additional studies are necessary to clarify whether iron supplementation is beneficial for non-anemic patients with telogen effluvium.

Patients typically exhibit active shedding that persists for two to three months followed by stabilization and regrowth of hair. Cosmetically significant improvement is usually noted within 6 to 12 months. Telogen effluvium in which the underlying cause cannot be identified or removed may persist for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/telogen-effluvium/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1164291211\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telogen effluvium results from an alteration in follicular cycling that leads to the excessive shedding of telogen hairs. A wide variety of endogenous and exogenous factors have been linked to induction of telogen effluvium. Examples include serious illness, major surgery, childbirth, rapid weight loss, nutritional deficiency, profound emotional stress, and drug exposure. The cause of telogen effluvium may be multifactorial in patients who have multiple medical problems or who are taking multiple drugs. In some cases, an inciting factor cannot be identified. (See <a href=\"#H1164291218\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair loss in telogen effluvium manifests as a diffuse reduction in hair density. In most cases, the course is self-limited, with hair loss beginning two to three months after the inciting factor and reversing once the inciting factor resolves or is eliminated. (See <a href=\"#H1164291232\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic telogen effluvium is a less common, idiopathic presentation of telogen effluvium that most commonly occurs in women between the ages of 30 and 60 years. Chronic telogen effluvium may persist for years. (See <a href=\"#H1164291232\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less than 50 percent of the normal hair density usually is lost in telogen effluvium. Progression to complete balding does not occur. (See <a href=\"#H1164291232\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20017145\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of telogen effluvium can usually be made based upon the patient history and physical examination. Scalp biopsies are typically reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H1164291246\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important component of the management of patients with telogen effluvium is the identification and removal of the underlying cause.
