Intravenous fibrinolytic agents are the most widely used means for acute re-establishment of vessel patency, and their use has become routine, as large clinical trials have shown their unequivocal benefit. In comparison, there is no apparent benefit in patients with non-ST elevation (non-Q wave) MI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-and-clinical-trials-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) agents and clinical trials in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The various markers that are used for establishing the efficacy of fibrinolysis are discussed here. The major issues in fibrinolytic therapy of acute STEMI, including efficacy, choice of agent, indications and contraindications, the concurrent use of other agents, and the role of primary angioplasty as an alternative to fibrinolysis, are addressed elsewhere.

This classification characterizes coronary blood flow in the infarct-related artery, which is usually measured at 60 to 90 minutes after the administration of fibrinolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIMI 0 refers to the absence of any antegrade flow beyond a coronary occlusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIMI 1 flow is faint antegrade coronary flow beyond the occlusion, although filling of the distal coronary bed is incomplete.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIMI 2 flow is delayed or sluggish antegrade flow with complete filling of the distal territory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIMI 3 flow is normal flow that fills the distal coronary bed completely</p><p/><p>There are a number of factors that can influence TIMI flow grade after fibrinolysis, including hemodynamics, local anatomy, amount of residual thrombus, and cellular factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52322\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52322 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Angiography performed within four to six hours of symptom onset in patients with ST elevation MI (STEMI) reveals complete occlusion in 80 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Epicardial patency (TIMI 2 or 3 flow) following fibrinolytic therapy was achieved in 73 percent in a meta-analysis of five trials of almost 4000 patients in whom angiographic data were obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, there may be differences between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator or tissue plasminogen activator) and streptokinase with regard to time to treatment and vessel patency. This was illustrated in a study of 481 patients that analyzed patency rates at 90 minutes based upon treatment &lt;3 or &ge;3 hours after symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The patency rate (TIMI 2 or 3 flow) was similar with alteplase (72 percent) in the two groups but was significantly higher when streptokinase was administered early rather than late (87 versus 60 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63689\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63689 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The presence of TIMI 3 (normal) flow at 60 or 90 minutes is an important predictor of outcome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75629 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Only restoration of normal epicardial flow has been associated with improved left ventricular function and survival, since the outcome of patients with TIMI 2 flow is similar to those with only TIMI 0 or 1 flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/6,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-13</a>]. This was illustrated in the meta-analysis of five trials cited above in which short-term mortality (in-hospital to 30 days in the different trials) was 3.7, 7.0, and 8.8 percent among patients with TIMI grade 3, 2, and <span class=\"nowrap\">0/1</span> flow, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients with TIMI 3 flow also had lower peak creatine kinase (CK) levels, fewer regional wall motion abnormalities, and a smaller decrease in ejection fraction than those with TIMI 2 flow.</p><p>The importance of TIMI 3 flow illustrates one of the limitations of fibrinolysis in patients with an STEMI. TIMI 3 flow is achieved in only 50 to 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/6,8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,14</a>] (53 percent in the meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]) compared to over 90 percent with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>There are several possible explanations for worse outcomes with TIMI 2 compared to TIMI 3 flow at 60 to 90 minutes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most TIMI grade 2 flow is observed in the left anterior descending artery (an infarct artery location associated with high mortality), while most TIMI grade 3 flow is observed in the right coronary artery (an infarct location associated with lower mortality) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is angiographic evidence that TIMI 2 flow may reflect advanced microvascular damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIMI 2 flow at 90 minutes may reflect incomplete clot lysis. This was illustrated in a study from the GUSTO-I investigators, which evaluated 914 patients who underwent coronary angiography at both 90 minutes and five to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. TIMI 2 flow was observed in 278 patients at 90 minutes; 67 percent of these patients improved to TIMI 3 flow at follow-up. The patients with late improvement in flow had larger caliber vessels and a lower incidence of visible clot. Their left ventricular function was intermediate between those who had no reperfusion (TIMI 0 or 1 flow) and those with complete reperfusion (TIMI 3 flow).</p><p/><p>Although most of the studies have reported the benefit of TIMI 3 flow on short-term mortality, achieving full patency has long-term mortality benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The GUSTO-I trial evaluated the importance of TIMI flow grade in 2431 patients with a myocardial infarction who received fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The two-year mortality for those with TIMI 3 flow was 7.9 percent compared to 15.7 percent for those with lesser flow grades (hazard ratio 0.48) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70952 \">figure 4</a>). When survival after 30 days was analyzed separately, there was an additional 3.3 percent mortality in those with TIMI 3 flow compared with 8.3 percent for lesser flow grades (hazard ratio 0.39); thus, the benefit of having TIMI 3 flow continued after the acute phase (a gain of 5 lives per 100 during this period). This benefit was independent of left ventricular ejection fraction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Myocardial tissue perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The restoration of epicardial coronary artery blood flow does not necessarily result in normalization of myocardial perfusion. Despite epicardial vessel patency, some patients have a profound reduction in antegrade coronary blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. This is referred to as the &quot;no-reflow phenomenon.&quot; It is presumed to reflect microvascular dysfunction.</p><p>Multiple factors probably contribute to no-reflow. These include myocardial necrosis and stunning, reperfusion injury resulting from oxygen free radical production, microvascular damage, distal embolization of plaque <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombus, release of active tissue factor from the dissected plaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and alpha-adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In clinical studies, no-reflow has often been defined as a TIMI flow grade &le;2 in the absence of macrovascular obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. However, microvascular perfusion may also be reduced in patients with TIMI grade 3 flow. Other measures that have been developed to assess microvascular perfusion include the TIMI frame count and the TIMI myocardial perfusion (TMP) grade (or myocardial blush grade) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/21,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">TIMI frame count</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TIMI frame count is the number of cine frames required for dye to first reach standardized distal coronary landmarks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Since the left anterior descending artery is usually longer than the other major arteries, the TIMI frame count for this vessel is often higher and a correction is made.</p><p>To normalize the values, the TIMI frame count of the left anterior descending artery is divided by 1.7, the ratio of the unadjusted mean TIMI frame count of the left anterior descending artery to the mean frame count of the other arteries; this is called the corrected TIMI frame count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Factors such as age, body size, systemic arterial pressure, and sex have only a small effect on the absolute corrected TIMI frame count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], which correlates with stenosis severity in the infarct artery, infarct zone regional wall motion, and peak creatine kinase levels after fibrinolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The corrected TIMI frame count appears to be effective in defining low- and high-risk patient subsets. One study measured the TIMI frame count in 1248 patients treated with fibrinolytic agents in the TIMI 4, 10, and 10B trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The following findings were noted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73547\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73547 \">figure 5</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who died in the hospital had a higher frame count (slower flow) compared to survivors (70 versus 50); a higher frame count was also observed in those who died by 30 to 42 days.

Although a frame count &le;40 is associated with TIMI grade III flow, those with a frame count &le;20 had a 7.9 percent incidence of in-hospital adverse events (death, recurrent infarction, shock, congestive heart failure, or left ventricular ejection fraction &le;40 percent) compared to 15.5 percent for those with a frame count between 21 and 40.</p><p/><p>The TIMI frame count is also a predictor of long-term outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/21,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,34</a>].

The corrected TIMI frame count was associated with five-year, but not 10-year, survival. Although the TIMI frame count provided additional prognostic information within each TIMI flow grade, it was not superior to the TIMI flow grade.</p><p>Although intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility of the TIMI frame count are good, there are factors that can introduce variability and decrease the TIMI frame count; these include nitrate use, increasing heart rate, and injection of dye during the beginning of diastole (versus the beginning of systole) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">TIMI myocardial perfusion grade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TMP grade is a simple angiographic method that was developed to characterize myocardial perfusion.

The 30-day mortality was lowest in those with TMP grade 3 (2 percent), intermediate in those with TMP grade 2 (4.4 percent), and highest in those with TMP grade 0 or 1 (6 percent). This relationship persisted even in patients with TIMI grade 3 flow and allowed for further risk stratification: The 30-day mortality was 0.7 percent for TMP grade 3, 2.9 percent for TMP grade 2, and 5 percent for TMP grade 0 or 1.</p><p>The TMP grade was an independent predictor of mortality even after adjusting for the presence of TIMI flow grade 3, the corrected TIMI frame count, and other clinical parameters.

Although ST segment resolution was less often seen at 60 minutes (33 versus 41 percent at 90 minutes), such patients had a lower mortality at 30 days and one year compared to those with resolution at 90 minutes (1.7 versus 3.1 percent and 2.7 versus 4.7 percent, respectively). These findings suggest that ST segment changes at 60 minutes should be routinely determined.

At 24 to 36 hours, complete, partial, or no resolution of the ST segment was observed in 51, 35, and 14 percent, respectively; the mortality at one year was 5, 8, and 10 percent, respectively. Patients receiving a fibrinolytic earlier (less than two hours of symptom onset) were more likely to have complete ST resolution compared to those treated between two to four and greater than four hours.

Seventy-nine percent of those with complete (&ge;70 percent) ST segment resolution had TIMI grade 3 flow and their 30-day mortality was 1 percent. In contrast, patients with partial or no ST segment resolution were significantly less likely to have TIMI grade 3 flow (50 and 44 percent, respectively) and had a higher 30-day mortality (4.2 and 5.9 percent, respectively). Although patients without ST segment resolution may still have a patent coronary artery, they are nevertheless at increased risk for mortality, which is likely due to extensive microvascular and tissue injury.</p><p>Similar results were observed in a study of 258 patients enrolled in TAMI-7 and GUSTO-I trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Resolution of ST segment elevation by &ge;50 percent was an independent predictor of the combined end point of in-hospital mortality and heart failure, while the TIMI flow grade was not a predictor.

In patients with TIMI 0 or 1 flow, there was no relationship between regional wall motion and ST segment recovery. With multivariate analysis, time to stable ST segment recovery was a predictor of infarct zone wall motion, independent of TIMI flow grade and the time from symptom onset to streptokinase therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Rapid resolution of ST segment elevation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid resolution of ST segment elevation in patients with biochemical markers of reperfusion, ie, early peak CK after fibrinolysis, identifies those with early artery recanalization who have adequate myocardial reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fibrinolytic-thrombolytic-agents-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-markers-of-efficacy/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p>Improved outcomes have been described in these patients.

Regardless of the site of the infarction, those with rapid resolution of ST segment elevation had lower peak CK levels and better left ventricular ejection fractions compared to those without concomitant rapid resolution, despite similar patency rates of the infarct-related artery. At two-year follow-up, the patients with rapid ST segment resolution had significantly lower rates of heart failure (1 versus 13 percent) and mortality (2 versus 13 percent), but a higher incidence of reinfarction (27 versus 9 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53047\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53047 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p>Some patients who are rapidly reperfused do not develop a cardiac biomarker elevation.
