This results in the &quot;sicca complex,&quot; a combination of dry eye (xerophthalmia) and dry mouth (xerostomia). A variety of other disease manifestations may also be present, including ocular or systemic extraglandular features.</p><p>The term &quot;keratoconjunctivitis sicca&quot; was coined by Henrik Sj&ouml;gren in 1933 to describe the ocular surface disease resulting from severe aqueous tear deficiency in a series of 19 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This term has been largely supplanted in the medical literature by &quot;dry eye.&quot;</p><p>SS occurs in a primary form not associated with other diseases and in a secondary form associated with other autoimmune rheumatic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.</p><p>The general principles and initial treatment of dry eye in patients with SS will be reviewed here. The treatment of dry eye in patients with moderate to severe involvement and other issues in SS, including the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of SS, the treatment of dry mouth and other non-ocular sicca symptoms in patients with SS, and the treatment of extraglandular manifestations of SS, are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dry-eyes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dry eyes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome#H19529178\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;, section on 'Dry eye and mouth in older adults'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3377142\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome (SS) benefit from multidisciplinary care. An eye care professional should evaluate and manage the dry eye of SS patients for a number of reasons. Several tests for diagnosing and monitoring dry eye, including ocular surface staining and the tear break-up time, require a slit lamp and therefore an ophthalmological examination (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome#H19530943\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;, section on 'Tests for dry eye'</a>). Measuring the tear film osmolarity can be performed by non-ophthalmologists as point-of-care testing and has been reported as useful to assess presence of dry eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nevertheless, conflicting reports also exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Symptoms of ocular irritation may arise from multiple causes, not only aqueous tear deficiency, and these can be differentiated by an eye care professional. Some experts thus prefer the use of the term &quot;dysfunctional tear syndrome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] rather than &quot;dry eye&quot; to reflect the inclusion of patients who have abnormalities in tear film composition but no reduction in tear volume. Over 80 percent of patients with SS have concomitant meibomian gland dysfunction, and this requires recognition and specific treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Finally, patients with SS and severe dry eye disease are at risk of vision-threatening ocular complications, sometimes with minimal antecedent symptoms, and regular monitoring by an eye care professional is therefore warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The aims of therapy for dry eye are twofold: to provide relief of symptoms, including dryness, burning, a sandy-gritty ocular irritation, pain, ocular fatigue, fluctuating or diminished vision, and pressure behind the eye; and to prevent damage to the eye due to ongoing inflammation of the ocular surface, such as sterile keratitis, epithelial erosions, neovascularization and ulceration of the cornea, and scarring of the ocular surface.</p><p>There are only a few large, well-designed, randomized trials that have evaluated the ability of specific treatments to improve dry eye signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms in patients with SS. No studies have assessed the ability of any form of treatment to prevent ocular extraglandular complications such as corneal melt or sterile ulcers. A 2011 systematic literature review summarized results of available published evidence with regard to treatment outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In 2016, a consensus panel provided recommendations for the evaluation and management of dry eye associated with SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Our general approach is based upon the available data from published studies as well as our clinical experience and is generally consistent with previous consensus recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. The choice of therapies depends upon the severity of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H3377156\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy and mild disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3377163\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe disease'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-moderate-to-severe-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of moderate to severe dry eye in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3377156\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL THERAPY AND MILD DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management in all patients should focus on symptomatic relief and prevention of disease progression. Such treatment may be sufficient in patients with mild or only episodic discomfort and in those with only mild signs of local disease, such as mild ocular surface staining or mildly increased tear osmolarity. Management includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient education regarding the disease and its complications, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Counseling regarding home, workplace, and other environmental factors that may worsen symptoms and self-management techniques for tear conservation (see <a href=\"#H94900469\" class=\"local\">'Tear conservation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H94900496\" class=\"local\">'Environmental management'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Instruction regarding the signs and symptoms of blepharitis which are distinct from those of aqueous tear deficiency and require specific management techniques (see <a href=\"#H94901495\" class=\"local\">'Potential complications'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of prescription and nonprescription systemic medications that may cause or exacerbate symptoms (see <a href=\"#H94900523\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of medications causing dryness'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> as needed for relief of symptoms of ocular discomfort (see <a href=\"#H94901467\" class=\"local\">'Artificial tears'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94900469\"><span class=\"h2\">Tear conservation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with dry eye and Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome (SS) should generally adopt measures for tear conservation. The use of medications that may worsen symptoms of dryness should be avoided, whenever possible. Physical barriers, such as large-frame glasses to minimize tear evaporation, can be helpful. The use of these strategies is widely supported by experts in dry eye and is consistent with our clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/4,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,11</a>]. However, formal study of the effectiveness of these techniques is lacking, although they have no foreseeable clinically significant risks.

Frequent, short breaks and additional longer breaks may be beneficial; other proposed therapies include efforts to increase the blink rate and the increased use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>. However, the degree of benefit of these interventions for dry eye related to computer use is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H94901467\" class=\"local\">'Artificial tears'</a> below.)</p><p>The use of humidifiers is helpful in bedrooms and other rooms in which the patient spends a lot of time. The regular use of warm compresses over the eyes can also provide symptomatic relief by improving meibomian gland secretions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94901188\"><span class=\"h4\">Operating room and perioperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-lubricant-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ocular lubricant</a> should be used as a preventive measure prior to surgery. During any surgery requiring general anesthesia, it is important to prevent ocular drying by instilling an over-the-counter ocular ointment and then gently taping the eyelids shut.</p><p>In addition, patients should be allowed to bring their topical medications for dry eye from home if they are unavailable in the hospital; these medications should be available as needed.</p><p>The level of humidity in operating rooms and in postoperative units may be very low, which increases the risk of dry eye complications, including corneal abrasions. Dryness is also worsened when non-humidified oxygen is administered by facemask.

The degree to which such medications are relatively contraindicated depends upon the severity of disease for which the drug is being administered and upon the amount to which the drug worsens dryness in the dose used in a given patient. The use of multiple drugs that, individually, may have modest drying effects can also be problematic.</p><p>Dryness of the eyes is often caused by the use of drugs with anticholinergic side effects, such as the tricyclic antidepressants and many others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F100289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100289 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

These drops also generally include a spreading agent and a preservative. The frequency of use varies with the degree of dryness, with the specific product used, and with the ambient humidity and other environmental factors. These tears differ in viscosity, also affecting how long they last following an application. Higher-viscosity drops require less frequent application, but they may cause visual blurring and can increase the risk of blockage of the meibomian glands, with resultant posterior blepharitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">&quot;Artificial tears: Drug information&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">&quot;Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose: Drug information&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Preservative-free preparations (eg, Tears Naturale Free, Bion Tears, HypoTears PF, Refresh, Moisture Eyes Free, and TheraTears Free) are preferred in patients who develop irritation from frequent use of tears containing preservatives. The irritation related to preservatives can be associated with ocular surface changes involving the cornea and conjunctiva, with abnormal tear film, and with inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Such irritation may occur with use every two to four hours in some patients; thus, patients should generally avoid using drops containing preservatives more than four times daily. Preservative-free tears are typically supplied in single-use <span class=\"nowrap\">dispensers/vials</span>. Potential disadvantages of these fluids are high cost and, for patients with arthritis, difficulty with opening the single-use containers. These products may be available for purchase in bulk at lower cost through the internet.</p><p>The benefits of switching from preserved to preservative-free formulations have not been formally evaluated in patients with SS but have been shown in both retrospective and prospective studies of patients being treated for glaucoma, in whom substantial reductions in irritation symptoms and in signs of palpebral, conjunctival, and corneal damage were seen with reduced usage of preservative-containing drops, particularly after switching entirely to preservative-free drops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. In one prospective study involving 158 patients, the number of patients with symptoms during treatment was reduced by half after switching to preservative-free medication, and the number of patients with abnormal signs was reduced by 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As examples, symptoms of irritation, burning, and stinging and findings of corneal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> staining were both reduced after 6 and 12 weeks with preservative-free drops (from 56 to 31 to 28 percent and from 82 to 53 to 41 percent, respectively).</p><p>There are additional differences in individual preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/10,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,32</a>]. An example of a tear that has a decreased osmolarity to compensate for higher salt concentrations in the dry eye is HypoTears. Systane drops include a lipid-stabilizing agent. The addition of a mucolytic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetylcysteine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetylcysteine</a>, which breaks up mucus strands and filaments, should be tried in patients who complain of sticky eyes in the morning or who have mucus filaments on examination. The patient should be warned of its unpleasant smell (like rotten eggs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Artificial tears</a> containing sodium hyaluronate in concentrations of 0.1 to 0.3% are marketed in Japan, Europe, Australia, Russia, and parts of Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In the United States, no artificial tear preparations have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in which sodium hyaluronate is listed as the active ingredient. However, several over-the-counter artificial tear products in the United States include sodium hyaluronate as an inactive ingredient in unknown concentrations.</p><p>Slow-release artificial tear inserts (eg, Lacrisert), which contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxypropyl-cellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxypropyl cellulose</a> but no preservatives, avoid the need for frequent instillation of drops (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxypropyl-cellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">&quot;Hydroxypropyl cellulose: Drug information&quot;</a>). However, artificial tear inserts are difficult for many patients with arthritis to place in the lower conjunctival recess. The patient must have enough tears to dissolve the pellet and enough dexterity to place the insert into the eye without damage to the corneal surface. These inserts are usually reserved for bedtime use, since they invariably blur the vision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94901495\"><span class=\"h3\">Potential complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several problems that can be associated with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>, including irritation due to components of the drops themselves and blepharitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching or increased irritation of the eye may occur in some patients with use of drops that contain preservatives, stabilizers, or solubilizers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A preservative that is acceptable to most patients without severe dry eyes may reach a higher concentration in the patient with dry eyes and may be more likely to cause problems. Although these additives extend the lifetime of products, they may produce local irritation and persistent symptoms despite the use of drops, especially if used every two to four hours. If this occurs, an alternative preparation can be tried that is preservative-free or uses a different preservative. The preservatives used in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> that are most responsible for irritation in dry eye patients (eg, benzalkonium chloride) have generally been replaced by less irritating compounds but may still be used in other types of eye drops.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior blepharitis is caused by clogging, inflammation and subclinical infection (commonly staphylococcal) of the meibomian glands of the eyelid; it can be worsened by contact lens use. Symptoms resemble those of aqueous tear deficiency, but, unlike aqueous tear deficiency, blepharitis is often associated with redness of the lower lids, sometimes excessive tearing, and clogged-up meibomian gland orifices with lid margin telangiectasia. It is important to evaluate the presence of blepharitis in patients with SS and address it separately from aqueous tear deficiency.

Attention to ambient humidity and other environmental factors, attention to medications that exacerbate dryness that are being used for other indications, and use of physical barriers to avoid drying or irritation of the eyes are important first-line measures. Particular attention to ocular exposure and care should be given to patients undergoing surgical procedures. (See <a href=\"#H94900469\" class=\"local\">'Tear conservation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with SS, we recommend the regular use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> as needed rather than the use of interventions for tear conservation alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Identifying the agent that provides the most comfort for an individual patient is best determined by trying different agents. At night, a longer-acting lubricant ointment may be useful. (See <a href=\"#H94901467\" class=\"local\">'Artificial tears'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with increased irritation of the eye with use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> containing preservatives, stabilizers, or solubilizers, and in patients requiring artificial tears and other topical ocular medications containing preservatives more than four times daily, an alternative preparation should be tried that is preservative-free or uses a different preservative.

It is important to differentiate from aqueous tear deficiency because it requires separate treatment rather than intensification of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-lubricant-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ocular lubricant</a> therapy. Blepharitis is often associated with redness of the eyelids, episodes of excessive tearing, and evidence of meibomian gland plugging and telangiectasia. Blepharitis can be improved with warm compresses with or without <span class=\"nowrap\">topical/oral</span> antibiotics.
