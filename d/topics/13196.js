Most smoking-related mortality is due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Tobacco use also increases the risk of many other acute and chronic diseases, including cancers at many sites other than the lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57169\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57169 \">table 1</a>). Smoking cessation is associated with clear health benefits and should always be a major health care goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Screening all patients for tobacco use and providing all smokers a brief smoking cessation intervention are among the most cost-saving clinical preventive services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In a study of results from two surveys in the United States, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), self-reported cigarette usage rates corresponded to less than two-thirds of taxed cigarette sales [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Variability over time in the relationship between rates of self-reported cigarette use and taxed cigarette sales can obscure changing patterns of use.</p><p>Tobacco products are used by over 20 percent of United States adults. According to the initial report (2013 to 2014) of a large longitudinal United States study involving over 45,000 adults and youth, 28 percent of adults use tobacco products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In 2015, 20.1 percent of adults were current users of any tobacco product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], with rates varying among states, from 10.2 percent in California to 27.7 percent in Wyoming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CIGARETTE USE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3081084129\"><span class=\"h2\">Tobacco cigarettes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarettes remain the most common tobacco product used in the United States. However, an increasing proportion of tobacco users are using multiple products, most often cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Alternate forms of tobacco are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50718 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H417218\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD), a systematic analysis of 25 years of tobacco use in 195 countries and territories, determined the 2015 worldwide age-standardized prevalence of daily smoking was 25 percent among men and 5.4 percent among women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, there was great heterogeneity among different countries, with the prevalence of daily smoking by men varying from 4 to 47 percent, and by women from 1 to 44 percent. Most countries showed a decline in smoking prevalence over the course of the study. The study did not assess use of smokeless tobacco (SLT) or electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes).</p><p>In the United States, two&ndash;thirds of adult tobacco users smoke tobacco cigarettes. The prevalence of cigarette smoking among United States adults has declined from 42.4 percent in 1965 to 15.5 percent in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. 2015 data showed differing rates of current cigarette smoking among states, from 8.0 percent in Utah to 21.7 percent in West Virginia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Over 75 percent of smokers smoke every day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Smoking is more common among men than among women; however, the gap has narrowed over time, though not disappeared (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65613\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65613 \">figure 1</a>). Tobacco use is also more common among younger adults aged 18 to 24 than among older age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>].</p><p>Smoking rates worldwide vary among groups categorized according to various sociodemographic factors. The GBD study used income, educational attainment and fertility rates to stratify each country into one of five quintiles of a composite indicator called the sociodemographic index (SDI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For men and women, smoking prevalence was generally higher in higher SDI quintiles and lowest in the low SDI quintile. By contrast, in the United States, the relationship between sociodemographic factors and smoking rates goes in the opposite direction. According to the National Health Interview Survey, almost one-quarter of individuals without a high school diploma smoke cigarettes, one-third of adults who have passed the General Education Development (GED) test smoke cigarettes, and fewer than 8 percent of adults with a college degree are cigarette smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For adults whose incomes were known, those with incomes below the federal poverty level were significantly more likely to smoke than adults with higher incomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>There is considerable variation in tobacco use rates and use of different tobacco products among United States adults working in different occupations and industries. Rates of cigarette smoking range from 26 percent among construction workers and 24 percent in the accommodation and food services industry to 7 percent in the education services industry and 6 percent among life, physical, and social science workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Greatest use of two or more tobacco products (10 percent) was found among workers in installation, maintenance, and repair.</p><p>Among <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups in the United States, American <span class=\"nowrap\">Indian/Alaskan</span> Natives have the highest prevalence of smoking, non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites have a lower smoking prevalence, and Hispanics and non-Hispanic Asians are least likely to be smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/6,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,14</a>].</p><p>Patterns of smoking cessation are discussed separately.

In most cases, the liquid used in the devices contains nicotine, in which case the devices may be called electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). E-cigarettes are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=e-cigarettes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;E-cigarettes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H824783352\"><span class=\"h2\">Heat-not-burn tobacco cigarettes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heat-not-burn (HNB) tobacco cigarettes use an electric blade to heat a tobacco stick to a temperature much below that at which tobacco cigarettes burn. HNB tobacco cigarettes are available in several countries, though not in the United States, and are marketed under different brand names by different manufacturers.</p><p>A laboratory study showed that HNB tobacco cigarettes released smoke containing lower amounts of harmful constituents than are found in conventional tobacco cigarette smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These included nicotine (84 percent of the amount found in traditional cigarettes), as well as volatile organic compounds (in lower amounts than in traditional cigarettes), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (almost all in much lower amounts), and carbon monoxide. Whether this translates to lower health risks is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279603278\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER FORMS OF TOBACCO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tobacco in other forms, including cigar, <span class=\"nowrap\">hookah/water</span> pipe, and smokeless tobacco (SLT), constitutes a considerable portion of tobacco use in the United States. Cigars, cigarillos, and filtered little cigars were used by 3.4 percent; smokeless tobacco by 2.3 percent; and pipes, water pipes or hookahs by 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Usage varies according to various demographic factors analyzed, with lower use among women than men and lower use by heterosexual people, people who live in the Northeast or West, and those with higher income and education levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A combination of tobacco products is consumed by 40 percent of tobacco users. The most frequent combination is cigarettes and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), used by almost one-quarter of those who use tobacco in more than one form. Alternate forms of tobacco are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50718 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1713552761\"><span class=\"h2\">Cigars and pipes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consumption of cigars in the United States increased between 2000 and 2012 after which it began to decline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F111805\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111805 \">figure 2</a>). A longitudinal tobacco use study conducted in the United States from 2013 to 2014 found 8 percent of adults smoked cigars, in the form of traditional cigars, cigarillos, or filtered cigars, with the heaviest usage among young adults 18 to 24, at 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pipe tobacco usage in that study was considerably lower, at 1 percent of adults.</p><p>The smoke from cigars and pipes is not typically inhaled as deeply into the lungs as is cigarette smoke and, for this reason, the risk of developing lung cancer from smoking cigars and pipes is lower than the risk from smoking cigarettes but higher than the risk for a nonsmoker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

This is a traditional form of tobacco use in the Middle East. A water pipe uses charcoal to heat tobacco, creating smoke that passes through a water bowl and is then inhaled. &#160;</p><p>The amount of nicotine and toxins varies based on the type of tobacco used and how it is smoked. Water pipe smoking is associated with lung cancer, carbon monoxide poisoning, and other respiratory diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. One meta-analysis of six cross-sectional studies found that water pipe smoking negatively affects lung function, particularly in reducing forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Water pipe smoking is likely to be a cause of obstructive lung disease.

Approximately half also used cigarettes, cigars, or more than one form of SLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. SLT was used most commonly by white males of lower socioeconomic status in non-urban areas and the southern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/6,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23,24</a>].</p><p>SLT products provide sufficient nicotine exposure to cause nicotine addiction. Different processing techniques for SLT, particularly &quot;curing,&quot; can result in markedly different contents of toxins in SLT products. SLT causes cancer of the oral cavity and may be associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, the health risks for certain diseases may be substantially less with SLT than with smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patterns-of-tobacco-use/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
