Intensive glycemic control aiming for near-normal levels has been shown to have a substantial beneficial effect (58 percent reduction in major CVD events) on macrovascular outcomes in type 1 diabetes, when applied early in the disease course and after one to two decades of therapy. In the setting of type 2 diabetes, with several co-prevalent risk factors for CVD, any beneficial effects of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular disease are likely to be less than those from similarly stringent control of blood pressure and lipid levels. In the acute setting, the evidence of benefit from strict glycemic control with insulin therapy in patients with acute MI is limited. The evidence in other groups of patient is inconsistent.

The patients with hyperglycemia were significantly less likely to have TIMI grade 3 (normal) flow before PCI compared to those with normoglycemia (12 versus 28 percent, adjusted odds ratio 2.6 for the absence of reperfusion).

The criteria for diagnosing diabetes were a fasting plasma glucose &ge;126 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> two-hour postload plasma glucose above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.

However, the incidence of previously undiagnosed diabetes was much lower (10 and 13 percent) when only the fasting blood glucose was used, as suggested by the American Diabetes Association. Whether the same patients had abnormal glucose metabolism at discharge and three months is not clear.

At the least, these findings strongly suggest that the fasting plasma glucose concentration and hemoglobin A1c should be measured during hospitalization in nondiabetic patients with an acute MI and that elevated values be repeated after discharge to identify those at increased risk</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">VALUE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence from which recommendations for glycemic control in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) comes from studies in three populations: critically ill patients (a minority of whom have an acute MI) in intensive care units; patients admitted with acute MI; patients admitted to general medical wards.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Critically ill patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trials have assessed the efficacy of strict glycemic control (target blood glucose 80 to 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [4.4 to 6.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> compared to standard care (180-200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dl;</span> 10.0-11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). The studies evaluating the efficacy of strict glycemic control in patients admitted to ICUs and recommendations for glycemic control in such patients are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and intensive insulin therapy in critical illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although initial single-center studies suggested a strong benefit, mainly in post-surgical patients, these data have not been replicated by others. The largest of the randomized trials in ICU patients, the NICE-SUGAR trial, found an increase in the rate of death at 90 days with intensive glucose control (81-108 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dl;</span> 4.5-6.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> as compared to those whose blood glucose was maintained between 144-180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dl</span> (8.0 to 10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-for-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-patients-with-and-without-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, the data from these studies may or may not apply to patients with myocardial infarction.

During this time, hypoglycemia should be avoided. This recommendation was made for patients with and without a diagnosis of diabetes.

However, whether control of hyperglycemia is sufficient to reduce morbidity and mortality is not proven at this time. The evidence upon which recommendations for glycemic control can be made in such patients is weak for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The randomized trials in patients with MI are significantly flawed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best data supporting glycemic control come from the trials of critically ill patients in intensive care units, but these trials included few patients with myocardial infarction. In addition the conclusions of some studies differ from others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients admitted with acute MI are not critically ill.</p><p/><p>While there is general agreement that glucose value above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> should be treated, there is insufficient evidence to establish an acceptable, minimal blood glucose (treatment target). Although lowering of high blood glucose levels may decrease the risk of poor clinical outcomes, overtreatment leading to hypoglycemia is associated with poor outcomes and hypoglycemia should be strictly avoided. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Value of glycemic control'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'J- or U-shaped curve'</a> above.)</p><p>For both stable and unstable patients with acute myocardial infarction with hyperglycemia, including patients with and without diabetes, we suggest an insulin based regimen to achieve and maintain blood glucose less than 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). There is insufficient evidence to establish a minimal acceptable blood glucose, but the avoidance of hypoglycemia is logical. &#160;</p><p>The discussions of how to achieve glycemic control in critically ill patients and in patients with diabetes admitted to general medical wards are found elsewhere.
