If a person eats peanuts, he or she can have an allergic reaction. Breathing in tiny pieces, such as dust from a package of peanuts, can also cause a reaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176796853\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an allergic reaction?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hives, which are raised, red areas of skin that are itchy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79242 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Puffiness of the face, eyelids, ears, mouth, hands, or feet </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the tongue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73131\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73131 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing, noisy breathing (wheezing), or coughing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or passing out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death (although this is rare)</p><p/><p>A severe allergic reaction is also called &quot;anaphylaxis.&quot; When people have anaphylaxis, they can get very sick, very quickly.</p><p>Although uncommon, a peanut allergy also sometimes triggers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eczema &ndash; This is a skin condition that makes the skin itchy and flaky.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eosinophilic esophagitis &ndash; This is a condition that makes it hard to swallow food or causes heartburn.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176796868\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a peanut allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about the foods you eat and the symptoms you have. He or she will also do a test to check for a peanut allergy. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A skin test &ndash; For this test, a doctor or nurse will put a tiny drop of peanut on your skin and make a tiny prick in your skin. Then he or she will watch your skin to see if you get a red, itchy bump.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood test to look for a peanut-specific antibody (protein) called &quot;IgE&quot;</p><p/><p>Some people have a test called a &quot;food challenge.&quot; This involves eating a serving of peanuts and seeing whether it causes symptoms. For safety reasons, this test is done only in a doctor's office or hospital. Usually, a food challenge is only done if other tests are not clear, or if a doctor wants to check if a person's allergy has gone away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176796883\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a peanut allergy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As of now, there is no cure for a peanut allergy.</p><p>Severe allergic reactions to peanuts are usually treated with medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">epinephrine</a>. Epinephrine comes in a device called an &quot;auto-injector.&quot; This device gives you a shot of epinephrine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75436\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75436 \">picture 3</a>). When your doctor prescribes an auto-injector, he or she will show you how to use it. Keep your auto-injector with you at all times. If you have an allergic reaction to peanuts, use your auto-injector right away, and then <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p>If you do not have an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">epinephrine</a> auto-injector and have an allergic reaction, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. Do not try to get yourself to the hospital. In the hospital, doctors can give you epinephrine and other medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176796915\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I prevent an allergic reaction?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only way to prevent an allergic reaction is to completely avoid eating peanuts or foods with peanuts in them. To know whether a food contains peanuts, you will need to read its ingredient label. Some countries (including the United States) have laws that make companies clearly list whether a food has peanuts in it.</p><p>Some foods have warning labels for food allergies, such as &quot;May contain peanuts.&quot; These foods might have been made on machines or in factories that also made other foods with peanuts. Doctors usually recommend that people with a peanut allergy avoid these foods.</p><p>Foods that are especially likely to contain peanuts include baked goods and Asian, African, and Mexican foods. If you eat at a restaurant, bakery, or ice cream parlor, be sure to tell your server about your peanut allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176796930\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know if I have a peanut allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with a peanut allergy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can have an allergic reaction if they share saliva with (kiss) someone who ate peanuts and did not brush his or her teeth afterward</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot have an allergic reaction by only smelling peanut butter</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Might have an allergic reaction by breathing in peanut dust or peanut protein, for example, when someone cooks with peanuts (if they are very allergic)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Might get hives on their skin if they touch peanuts or peanut butter</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sometimes have allergies to other foods, too, so might need to avoid eating certain other foods</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176796945\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child has a peanut allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child has a peanut allergy, let his or her caregivers, schools, and camps know. You should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell them which foods your child can and can't eat.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make a plan so they know how to treat an allergic reaction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure they know where your child's <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">epinephrine</a> auto-injector is and how and when to use it.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure they know how to reach you or your child's doctor in case of an emergency.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176796960\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child outgrow his or her peanut allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children do not outgrow their peanut allergy, but some do. Your child's doctor will monitor your child's peanut allergy over time to see whether he or she outgrows it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176796975\"><span class=\"h1\">Where can I get more information?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can get more information about peanut allergies (and other food allergies) from an organization called Food Allergy Research &amp; Education.
