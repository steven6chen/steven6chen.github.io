In CM, pathologic numbers of mast cells accumulate in the skin, causing cutaneous and systemic symptoms, but there is no evidence for abnormal accumulation in other organs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most prevalent form of CM is maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM), which includes urticaria pigmentosa (UP) and rare nodular and plaque forms. MPCM accounts for 70 to 90 percent of all pediatric cases of CM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The majority of children with UP (up to 80 percent) develop initial skin lesions in the first year of life, and the diagnosis is usually made before the age of two years. Disease is limited to the skin, although release of mast cell mediators may lead to episodes of multisystem symptoms (eg, pruritus, flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea) in over two-thirds of children with UP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The other forms of CM that present in young children are mastocytomas, which account for up to one-fourth of CM, and diffuse CM, accounting for 1 to 3 percent.</p><p/><p>Systemic mastocytosis (SM), in which other organs are affected, is rare in children and accounts for less than 10 percent of pediatric mastocytosis cases. Children with SM usually have skin lesions similar to patients with adult-onset disease, but also may have persistently elevated serum total tryptase (a protease produced predominantly in mast cells), abnormalities on complete blood count and differential, hepatosplenomegaly, or rarely, unexplained lymphadenopathy.</p><p>The evaluation of a child with skin lesions suggestive of mastocytosis involves history and physical examination, laboratory tests to detect involvement of other organs, and biopsy of lesional skin (unless the clinician is experienced enough to diagnose mastocytosis skin lesions without a biopsy). If systemic symptoms are mild, there is no evidence of hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy on physical exam, and routine laboratories are normal, then no additional evaluation is needed initially and the child may be monitored. Lymphocytosis (which may be normal in young children) and thrombocytosis may be seen, although these findings usually normalize over time and should not prompt a bone marrow evaluation in the absence of other abnormalities. In contrast, a bone marrow examination and evaluation for SM are indicated if hepatosplenomegaly is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Bone marrow examination is also indicated if skin lesions persist beyond puberty or serum tryptase increases over time or remains elevated.</p><p>The prognosis is excellent for children with CM (both MPCM and mastocytomas) who have onset of skin lesions within the first two years of life, because spontaneous resolution or improvement is common after several years. Skin lesions usually begin to regress after the child is five to six years of age, with an average duration of approximately 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In contrast, CM that develops after the age of two years tends to persist. Treatment and prognosis of CM are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-mastocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of cutaneous mastocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prognosis for children with systemic forms of mastocytosis depends upon the specific type of disease present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic mastocytosis: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89619813\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An algorithmic approach to the evaluation and diagnosis of a child with skin lesions suggestive of mastocytosis is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105873\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105873 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1061721905\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Daily and episodic symptoms should be reviewed in detail. Typical cutaneous symptoms include pruritus and flushing, erythema, swelling, and dermatographism. Children with diffuse cutaneous involvement and mastocytomas may present with blistering and bullae. Systemic symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and rarely, hypotension or cyanotic spells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91167\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91167 \">table 1</a>).

Most children have &quot;polymorphic&quot; lesions that are usually brown in color and vary in size and shape. The lesions may be raised or flat and are typically located on the trunk, extremities, head, and neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105581\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105581 \">picture 1</a>). A small number of children may have small, &quot;monomorphic&quot; lesions that resemble the adult-onset lesions of MPCM or urticaria pigmentosa (UP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105069\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105069 \">picture 2</a>). Children in the latter group have a greater risk of having systemic mastocytosis (SM) and persistence into adulthood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mastocytomas</strong> &ndash; Mastocytomas typically present as single-fixed lesions that are raised and either flesh-colored, yellow, or erythematous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76891\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76891 \">picture 3</a>). Occasionally, more than one mastocytoma can be found. Mastocytomas are almost always found in children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin thickening consistent with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis</strong> &ndash; Children with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM) do not have individually discernible lesions but rather a diffuse thickening and slight darkening of the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105584\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105584 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103181\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103181 \">picture 5</a>). These children are more prone to blistering and severe systemic symptoms. Patients with DCM may or may not experience itching. Two subtypes have been proposed: one in which larger bullae form on deeply erythematous skin and a second characterized by yellow-orange skin infiltration with minimal small blisters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, there are case reports of mixed presentations as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1061722015\"><span class=\"h3\">Darier's sign</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If lesions of UP are detected, then the examiner may lightly rub, scratch, or stroke a small area of the affected skin. The development of erythema, swelling, or urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">over/around</span> the lesion within a few minutes is called Darier's sign and is pathognomonic for the presence of mast cells within the lesion. However, lesions consistent with mastocytomas should not be rubbed or scratched, as this may lead to significant mast cell-mediator release that can result in generalized flushing and hives. Instead, the caretaker can usually report that these symptoms occur if the lesion is disturbed. In addition, pictures of the lesions at the time of flares are recommended to document Darier's sign.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1061722208\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1061722226\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tests discussed in this section should be performed at least once in children with disease that appears to be limited to the skin, to ensure that there is no evidence of systemic involvement.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with differential to evaluate for persistent and unexplained cytopenias and immature or abnormal myeloid and lymphoid leukocytes. Eosinophilia may also be seen, but can be transiently elevated in mastocytosis without clinical consequence.

Tryptase is a protease produced predominantly in mast cells, although a small amount is made by basophils and myeloid precursors as well. The presence of elevated serum concentrations of tryptase is one of the minor criteria for the diagnosis of SM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Normal levels are between 1 and 11.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (some laboratories consider 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> to be the upper limit of normal).

Liver function tests should be normal. Serum tryptase is usually normal, although it can be elevated when the skin is diffusely involved, such as in DCM, even in the absence of systemic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/2,5,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,9-11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SM should be strongly suspected in patients with baseline levels of total tryptase &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> on at least two occasions, liver or spleen enlargement, or abnormalities of the complete blood count with differential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Virtually all children with SM also have skin lesions, although the extent of skin involvement does not correlate with systemic (bone marrow disease). SM presenting with symptoms of mast cell activation in children without skin lesions has not been reported. Patients with SM most often have monomorphic UP-like skin lesions. Most children with SM have indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM), and advanced forms of SM are rare. The absolute level of total tryptase does not predict the category of SM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) and mastocytosis associated with hematologic malignancies can have similar elevations of tryptase as ISM. However, mast cell leukemia (MCL) is generally associated with extremely elevated tryptase levels, sometimes &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368972721\"><span class=\"h3\">Skin biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, cutaneous forms of mastocytosis are recognizable by inspection of the skin and skin biopsy is not essential, particularly if the clinician is familiar with the appearance of CM. However, a 3 mm punch biopsy of lesional skin should be performed when the diagnosis of CM is in doubt. Skin biopsy does not provide information about systemic involvement.</p><p>Skin biopsy may be submitted for mutational analysis of <em>KIT</em>.

Note that biopsy findings alone, without the characteristic skin lesions of various forms of CM, are <strong>not</strong> sufficient for diagnosis, because mast cells can accumulate in the skin in other disorders. (See <a href=\"#H1061723572\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no specific cut-off value for numbers of mast cells in the skin that is considered abnormal. Mast cells in lesions of urticaria pigmentosa (UP) may have irregular shapes, sometimes with bilobed nuclei, which may be seen on light microscopy. Infiltrating eosinophils may also be present, but other types of inflammatory cells are usually absent.</p><p>There are four patterns of mast cell infiltrates that are observed in CM, which only partially correlate with the type of clinical lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103182\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103182 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perivascular infiltrates in the papillary and upper dermis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sheet-like infiltrates in the papillary body and upper reticular dermis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interstitial infiltrates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodular infiltrates</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1495323404\"><span class=\"h4\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analysis of cutaneous mast cells for the presence of mutations in <em>KIT</em> is not a standard part of the evaluation of skin biopsies, although it was proposed in a 2015 consensus report to fulfill a minor diagnostic criterion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Several studies have found a high rate (up to 80 percent) of <em>KIT</em> mutations in lesional skin samples obtained from children with CM. The prognostic significance of these findings is not clear. While approximately 40 percent of these mutations involved exon 17 (including D816V as seen in adult-onset disease), 40 percent had mutations in other exons. One study suggested that <em>KIT</em> mutations at codon 816 (in exon 17) may be associated with persistent disease in adulthood and SM, while other mutations in exons 8 and 9 were associated with remission of cutaneous disease at puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, other studies did not find associations between specific mutations and prognosis, and further work is needed to clarify the prognostic significance of specific mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1061722523\"><span class=\"h3\">KIT mutational analysis of peripheral blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a mutation in <em>KIT</em> is one of the minor criteria for SM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82827 \">table 2</a>).

The role of <em>KIT</em> analysis of peripheral blood is evolving. Bone marrow lesional tissue has the highest sensitivity for detection of somatic <em>KIT</em> mutations due to the higher frequency of mast cell precursors and presence of mature mast cells, and a bone marrow evaluation is the most useful means of evaluating for <em>KIT</em> mutations in most patients. However, analysis of peripheral white blood cells is convenient and available through at least two commercial laboratories (in the United States, Quest Diagnostics and Mayo Clinic Laboratories) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1061722607\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO REFER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generalists should perform a history and physical examination (with careful attention to the skin), obtain the basic laboratories mentioned above if possible, and obtain a biopsy of suggestive skin lesions if possible.

The approach to evaluation is similar to that in children, except that adolescents have a higher likelihood of having SM compared with children whose lesions start within the first two years of life. The indications for bone marrow evaluation are the same as those in children. However, an additional indication is the failure of skin lesions to begin to regress after puberty, or baseline serum tryptase levels that remain above the normal range (usually &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> after puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1495324651\"><span class=\"h2\">Analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bone marrow examination includes an evaluation of the histology of the core sample and of aspirated cells.

This process is limited to the skin in cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and involves extracutaneous tissues in systemic mastocytosis (SM) with or without skin involvement. In children, cutaneous forms of disease account for approximately 90 percent of cases. The most common type of CM is maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (MPCM), which includes urticaria pigmentosa (UP), as well as rare nodular and plaque forms. Many children with CM have episodes of systemic symptoms (eg, pruritus, flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea), which result from the release of mediators from cutaneous mast cells, so the presence of systemic symptoms does not distinguish between cutaneous and systemic disease. (See <a href=\"#H353783191\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of a child with suspected mastocytosis begins with a skin examination for characteristic lesions, such as MPCM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105581\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105581 \">picture 1</a>), mastocytomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76891\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76891 \">picture 3</a>), or skin thickening consistent with diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105584\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105584 \">picture 4</a>). The patient should also be assessed for hepatosplenomegaly. (See <a href=\"#H1061721905\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete blood count with differential, liver function tests, and a baseline serum tryptase should be obtained. Patients with persistent and unexplained abnormalities in any of these initial tests should be evaluated further for systemic forms of mastocytosis. (See <a href=\"#H1061722226\" class=\"local\">'Initial testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalists should perform a history and physical examination (with careful attention to the skin and elicitation of a Darier's sign), obtain the basic laboratories mentioned above if possible, and obtain a biopsy of suggestive skin lesions if possible.
