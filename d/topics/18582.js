A poll conducted in the United States in 2016 estimated that 3.3 percent of adult Americans (8 million) indicated that they follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, while 1.5 percent (3.7 million) follow a vegan diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this survey, &quot;vegetarian&quot; was defined as no meat, fish, or poultry; and &quot;vegan&quot; was defined as no meat, fish, poultry, dairy products, or eggs. When eating away from home, 37 percent (91 million) reported that they &quot;sometimes or always&quot; eat vegetarian or vegan meals; 5 percent (12 million) &quot;always&quot; choose vegetarian meals; and 3 percent (7 million) &quot;always&quot; choose vegan meals. As a result, more food companies and restaurants are offering vegetarian options, such as a vegan burger or vegan ice cream. Approximately 8 to 10 percent of adults in Germany, Austria, Italy, and the United Kingdom describe themselves as vegetarians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>An increasing number of children and adolescents maintain a vegetarian eating style [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. An estimated 8 percent of adolescents in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and 6 percent of public middle- and high-school students surveyed in the midwestern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] consume a vegetarian diet. A poll conducted in 2014 estimated that 4 percent (2 million) of American youth aged 8 to 18 years are vegetarian or vegan, 3 percent (1.5 million) do not eat meat, fish, or poultry, and 1 percent (500,000) do not eat meat, fish, poultry, dairy, or eggs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, an estimated 32 percent (15 million) of American youth eat one or more vegetarian meals per week; 4 percent &quot;always&quot; have vegetarian or vegan meals and 1 percent &quot;always&quot; have vegan meals. </p><p>Studies of vegetarian diets are complicated by variations in definitions for the term &quot;vegetarian.&quot; Definitions range from whether the individual considers himself or herself as vegetarian (&quot;self-defined&quot; vegetarians), avoids meat only, or lives by the strict definition (never consuming meat, fish, and poultry). As an example, one review of dietary patterns and nutrient intakes of self-defined vegetarians (aged six years and older) found that patterns ranged from those who consumed reduced amounts of red meat but included poultry and fish, to those who excluded all animal foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Reasons for choosing a vegetarian diet are varied and include potential health benefits and sociopolitical, ecological, and ethical issues related to allocation of resources and animal rights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/2,4,5,16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5,16-22</a>]. In some cases, and particularly among adolescents, it may be difficult to distinguish whether a choice to eat a vegetarian diet is related to health or ethical concerns, versus a desire for dietary restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The types and composition of vegetarian diets also are varied and have important implications for the growth and development of children and adolescents. </p><p>The best available data regarding the nutritional quality of vegetarian diets and strategies to prevent nutritional deficiencies while consuming vegetarian diets are reviewed here. Nutrition requirements, deficiencies, and supplementation of specific nutrients are discussed separately. (See appropriate topic reviews).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF VEGETARIAN DIETS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vegetarian diets vary according to the degree of avoidance of foods of animal origin, and definitions are not consistent across studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/4,15,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15,25,26</a>]. According to the strictest definition, a vegetarian diet consists primarily of cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts; animal foods, including milk, dairy products, and eggs generally are excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/2,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27</a>]. Several less restrictive vegetarian diets may include animal flesh, eggs, or milk and dairy products. </p><p>Vegetarian diets frequently are grouped as follows (less to more restricted):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Semi-vegetarian &ndash; Meat occasionally is included in the diet. Some people who follow such a diet may not eat red meat but may eat fish and perhaps chicken. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pescatarian &ndash; Fish and shellfish are included in the diet, but no meats or poultry. Variations are pescatarian-vegetarian (includes milk and eggs), or pescatarian-vegan (excludes milk and eggs).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lacto-ovovegetarian &ndash; Eggs, milk, and milk products (lacto = dairy; ovo = eggs) are included, but no meat is consumed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactovegetarian &ndash; Milk and milk products are included in the diet, but no eggs or meat are consumed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macrobiotic &ndash; Whole grains, especially brown rice, are emphasized and vegetables, fruits, legumes, and seaweeds are included in the diet. Locally-grown fruits are recommended. Animal foods limited to white meat or white-meat fish may be included in the diet once or twice a week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vegan &ndash; All animal products, including eggs, milk, and milk products, are excluded from the diet. Some vegans do not use honey and may refrain from using animal products such as leather or wool. They also may avoid foods that are processed or not organically grown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/18,25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25,28</a>].</p><p/><p>Vegetarian diets vary considerably, as do omnivorous diets. The nutritional adequacy of a vegetarian diet must be judged individually, not on the basis of what it is called but on the type, amount, and variety of nutrients that are consumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3085712745\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL HEALTH EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Existing data do not allow firm conclusions on health benefits or risks of present-day vegetarian type diets on the nutritional or health status of children and adolescents in resource-rich countries due to study heterogeneity, small sample sizes, the bias towards upper social classes and the scarcity of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The long-term effects of a vegetarian diet on morbidity and mortality are difficult to separate from those of the vegetarian lifestyle (eg, regular exercise, avoidance of tobacco and alcohol products). Consumption of a vegetarian diet is associated with lower incidence of obesity, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/2,20,29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20,29-35</a>]. These benefits are probably mediated by modest decreases in non-high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI) that are associated with vegetarian diet or lifestyle, compared with nonvegetarian diet or lifestyle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, there is no evidence that vegetarian diets have an independent protective effect on all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. It should be noted that these potential health benefits are not intrinsic to a vegetarian diet, for which the nutritional content can be highly variable. Overall, evidence suggests that being a lactovegetarian has greater health benefits and reduced health risks than being a vegan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In one study of a small number of adults who followed omnivorous, lacto-ovo-vegetarian, or vegan diets, those who consumed the lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet showed lower levels of anaerobic bacteria compared with individuals in the other two dietary groups, suggesting that this type of habitual dietary pattern reduced the potential cytotoxic risk within the gut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GROWTH OF VEGETARIAN CHILDREN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When meal planning is adequate and sufficient food is made available, physical growth of vegetarian, even vegan, children is within the normal range, although vegetarian children tend to be leaner than their omnivore counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/9,10,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,39-42</a>]. By contrast, poorly planned or severely restricted diets can lead to nutrient deficiencies that may compromise or delay growth in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/40,43-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,43-47</a>]. As an example, Dutch investigators conducted a longitudinal anthropometric study in a population consuming a macrobiotic diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Compared with the reference population, height and arm circumference were reduced for both boys and girls at all ages, despite the presence of catch-up growth as the children approached adolescence. Catch-up growth was related to the addition of dairy products to the diet.</p><p>In comparison, other studies have demonstrated normal growth in children consuming different types of vegetarian diets:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 1765 children aged 7 to 18 years attending Southern California state schools and Seventh-day Adventist schools, the Adventist semi-vegetarian children (those consuming meat less than once per week) were taller on average than their meat-eating classmates (2.5 and 2.0 cm for boys and girls, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 82 lacto-ovovegetarians, male adolescents had lower height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) than the reference population, and female adolescents had lower weight and BMI, with normal age at menarche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. By contrast, mean height and weight did not differ from those of the reference population in younger or older age groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anthropometric data were collected on 404 vegan children, aged 4 months to 10 years, on a collective farm in Tennessee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The mean height age and weight age of the vegan children were slightly less than the median of the reference population (0.1 standard deviation for height and 0.3 standard deviation for weight), although the height and weight for age were normal in most children.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The greatest risks associated with inadequate nutrient intake from a vegetarian diet occur during periods of growth. The more restrictive the vegetarian diet, the greater the risk of dietary inadequacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/11,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,39</a>]. Vegetarian diets can meet nutrient needs for growth and development if they are carefully planned with attention to the following possible limiting nutrients: energy, protein, iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin D, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin B12</a> (cyanocobalamin), long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, and dietary fiber, as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/2,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,48-50</a>].</p><p>The establishment of healthy eating patterns in childhood reduces the likelihood of developing chronic diseases later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/51-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-59</a>]. Thus, vegetarian children, like other children, should consume a diet low in fat, saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol, and high in complex carbohydrates, fiber, and antioxidants (eg, vitamins A and C, carotenoids, and phytochemicals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/16,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,60,61</a>]. In one survey of self-reported dietary intake in 4746 adolescent school children in Minnesota, the percentage of those meeting the Healthy People 2010 nutritional objectives were compared with vegetarians and nonvegetarians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Adolescents who identified themselves as vegetarians were more likely than nonvegetarians to meet the objectives for total fat (70 versus 48 percent), saturated fat (65 versus 39 percent), daily servings of vegetables (26 versus 14 percent), and &ge;5 servings of fruits or vegetables per day (39 versus 28 percent). The mean calcium intake in both groups was approximately 1100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> which is less than the recommended 1300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day;</span> only 30 percent of the students, regardless of dietary group, met the recommended target for calcium. A separate study surveyed parents and analyzed menu nutrients to evaluate the new standards for food and nutrition as a part of the South Carolina ABC Child Care program for preschool children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. This study found that vegetarian menus were higher in fiber and lower in sodium compared with non-vegetarian menus, but otherwise did not differ in nutrient composition; adding more vegetarian menu items improved the nutrient content of menus, while keeping energy intake, saturated fat, sodium, and cholesterol levels at a more optimum level. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Eating disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although adolescents may experience the health benefits of a vegetarian diet, in some individuals the vegetarian diet is a manifestation of dietary restriction and other disordered eating behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/13,24,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24,64</a>]. In one report, current adolescent vegetarians were more likely than nonvegetarians to report binge eating, and vegetarians were more likely than nonvegetarians to engage in unhealthy weight control behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

If energy intake is not sufficient, meeting essential nutrient needs is difficult, and proteins are broken down for energy instead of for growth and repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/9,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,66,67</a>].

A plant-based diet that has a high fiber content and low caloric density may provide a sense of fullness before an adequate amount of energy is ingested. This situation may be a significant problem in young children, who have small stomach capacities.</p><p>Adolescents who follow a vegetarian diet as a means of weight management should be monitored closely for evidence of an eating disorder and given anticipatory guidance to ensure adequate dietary energy intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. To support appropriate weight gain, dietary variety should be emphasized, and foods should be relatively high in energy density without significant bulk. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) &quot;<a href=\"https://www.choosemyplate.gov/MyPlate-Daily-Checklist&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX//H/lCKGrzlN77aXPhyJ0wy5xXPMmKKOC69aLUTyVgTdK43LesUDkka2iENapMbrHx48ldkXY7PQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5353\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ChooseMyPlate checklist</a>&quot; tool depicting food groups and portion sizes may serve as a useful reference guide.

Examples of such foods include cooked legumes, whole grain breads, enriched cereals, nuts, and nut spreads (peanut, tahini, almond, and cashew butter), nutlike seeds (sunflower seeds, soybeans, sesame seeds), avocados, and dried fruits. In addition, the inclusion of dairy products in the vegetarian diet provides a substantial portion of essential nutrients. Dairy products are good sources of energy, protein, calcium, potassium, and magnesium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>For adolescents who choose to adopt a vegetarian diet, the clinician should inquire about what prompted a change in the diet, recognizing that the developmental period, as well as family preferences, may have played a role in his or her dietary choice. The clinician should ensure that the adolescent and the family have access to accurate nutritional resources and that dietary changes were not based on underlying emotional problems, including an eating disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Any adolescent whose body mass index (BMI) is less than the 15th percentile, or whose actual weight is less than 85 percent of the expected weight for height and age, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who has other features suggestive of an eating disorder (including disrupted menses or body image disturbances) is a candidate for referral for more intensive medical and psychological care.

Omega-3 fatty acids, which include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), or their precursor alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), are important for cardiovascular health and eye and brain development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/50,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,70</a>]. Vegetarians, particularly vegans, have lower blood levels of EPA and DHA than nonvegetarians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/2,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,71</a>]. Dietary supplementation with algal sources of DHA improves DHA concentrations in plasma and red blood cell fractions of adult vegetarian cohorts, but dose-response curves have not been determined because of the small number of studies to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Dietary requirements for n-3 fatty acids in infants, children, and adolescents have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Animal foods are considered complete or high-quality proteins because they contain all nine essential amino acids. Plant-based foods are usually incomplete, meaning they are deficient in one or more of the essential amino acids. Several approaches can be used to correct this deficiency: addition of milk or eggs, use of soybean products, use of complementary foods, and ingestion of protein-rich foods.</p><p>Soybean-based products are essentially equivalent in quality to animal protein and are an important source of protein for vegetarians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, young infants have a relatively high nutritional requirement for essential amino acids, and soybeans are deficient in methionine. Supplementation of soy-based formulas with methionine may improve the utilization of soy protein by infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. The need for essential amino acids decreases as growth and development progress. Thus, soy protein isolates without methionine supplementation can serve as a primary source of essential amino acids and nitrogen for protein maintenance in children older than two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>].</p><p>The essential amino acid deficit of one plant food can be overcome by combining it with a complementary plant food that provides adequate amounts of the limited essential amino acid. As an example, grains are low in the essential amino acid lysine and high in methionine, whereas legumes are low in methionine and high in lysine. Together, they combine to make a high-quality protein source. One need not consume complementary proteins at the same time or in the same meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The adequacy of protein intake is determined by the total quantity of protein and amino acids from the variety of foods consumed during the day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Digestibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, amino acids from animal sources are most easily digested (over 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Well-processed soy isolates are as digestible as egg protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Meat and fish are good sources of protein for children who consume semi-vegetarian or macrobiotic diets. Non-meat foods high in protein include soy products (eg, tofu and soy milk), milk, other dairy products, and eggs.

Milk and milk products are the primary source of zinc for children on vegetarian diets who also consume animal products. Good plant sources include whole grains, legumes, wheat germ, and nuts. Cereals are the primary source of zinc for children who consume vegetarian diets without milk; secondary sources are meat substitutes (eg, legumes, nuts, and soy products).</p><p>Certain food preparation techniques, such as the soaking of sprouting beans, grains, and seeds, as well as leavening breads, can reduce binding of zinc by phytates and increase zinc bioavailability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/2,101,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,101,102</a>].</p><p>The zinc in vegetarian diets has a lower bioavailability because of the high content of phytate and dietary fiber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/48,80,103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,80,103,104</a>]. Adult vegetarians do not typically develop zinc deficiency because they have a compensatory increase in fractional absorption. Children may be at greater risk of a suboptimal zinc status because of high requirements for growth. Zinc deficiency can be associated with growth impairment and an increased risk of infections, particularly diarrhea and pneumonia.

The optimal daily dietary allowance of calcium for children and adolescents is somewhat controversial but probably approximates 700 mg for children 1 to 3 years of age, 1000 mg for children 4 to 8 years of age, and 1300 mg for those 9 to 18 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78274 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].

The diminished intake of animal protein by vegetarians may help their net calcium balance by decreasing urinary calcium loss. Animal protein, with sulfur-containing amino acids, produces an increased acid load and decreases renal tubular calcium reabsorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56597 \">figure 1</a>). Animal protein intake also increases uric acid excretion and reduces urinary citrate excretion; all of these changes tend to promote calcium stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Protein'</a>.)</p><p>Most of the calcium needs of children who consume lactovegetarian or lacto-ovovegetarian diets can be met by low-fat milk and dairy products that provide approximately 75 percent of the calcium in the average American diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/108,112,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,112,113</a>]. Vegan children have more difficulty meeting calcium needs because they avoid dairy products, which contain more calcium than vegetables, fruit, and cereal grains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/49,114,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,114,115</a>]. Therefore, the calcium intake of children who consume vegan diets is generally lower than that of lacto-ovovegetarians and omnivores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/116-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">116-118</a>]. Vegan children can obtain calcium from foods naturally rich in calcium, calcium-fortified foods and beverages, calcium supplements, or a combination of these.</p><p>The following foods are naturally rich in calcium and low in oxalate: kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, broccoli, bok choy, dried figs, blackstrap molasses, and lime-processed tortillas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52445 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. However, to meet calcium requirements from these foods alone would be difficult, even with large portions.</p><p>Calcium-fortified foods include soy milk, soy yogurt, and soy cheese, as well as calcium precipitated tofu and calcium-fortified cereals, breakfast bars, pastas, waffles, and juices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/61,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,119</a>]. Calcium bioavailability in most of these sources is equivalent to milk. As an example, one eight-ounce glass of calcium-fortified orange juice provides 300 mg of calcium, equivalent to an eight-ounce glass of milk. In contrast, the bioavailability of calcium in soy milk is only 75 percent of that in cow's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].</p><p>The benefit of increasing calcium intake with fortified foods was demonstrated in a double-blind-placebo-controlled study of prepubertal girls with low spontaneous calcium intake who were randomly assigned to receive food products that were or were not fortified with 850 mg of calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Calcium fortification increased mean bone mineral density in all girls, but the increase was greatest in those who had spontaneous calcium intakes less than 850 mg. The gains in bone mass were present one year after discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>Calcium supplements also can be used to provide adequate calcium intake. However, foods rich in or fortified with calcium are preferred because they provide additional nutrients that are important for growth and development. Consuming calcium supplements at the same time as iron or zinc supplements may interfere with the absorption and utilization of these minerals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-requirements-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium requirements in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We recommend that vegetarian children who do not drink milk receive at least one calcium-rich or fortified food at each meal and several snacks to provide a calcium intake of 700 mg per day for children one to three years, 1000 mg per day if they are four to eight years, and 1300 mg per day if they are nine years and older. Children who are unable to meet these goals with calcium-rich foods should take a calcium supplement. The milk alternative should also be fortified with vitamin D because vitamin D facilitates the absorption of calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal levels of vitamin D metabolites are necessary for adequate intestinal calcium, phosphate absorption, and bone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/122-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">122-124</a>]. Vitamin D availability is a function of sunlight exposure and dietary intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65360\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65360 \">figure 2</a>). Maintenance of normal serum vitamin D concentrations requires exposure to the sun on hands, arms, and face for 10 to 15 minutes per day for fair-skinned individuals; individuals with dark skin pigmentation require 6 to 10 times as much exposure as a light-skinned individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].

The dietary fiber goals can be met best by eating a variety of fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, cereals, and grain products while consuming adequate energy intake for growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children can safely ingest planned vegetarian diets and attain normal growth and development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/74,146\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,146</a>]. A review of the composition of the individual diet is important to ensure adequate provision of energy, vitamins, and minerals. A supportive, nonjudgmental approach is important in establishing a relationship that will result in the parents' willingness to accept suggestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is possible to get complete balanced nutrition from a variety of vegetarian diets. More restrictive diets (eg, vegan) require particular care to ensure that all nutritional needs are met. Overall, a lactovegetarian diet has greater health benefits and fewer health risks than a vegan diet. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Types of vegetarian diets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some adolescents choose a vegetarian diet as a means of weight control, and clinicians should be alert for evidence of inappropriate dietary restriction and other disordered eating behaviors. An adolescent whose body mass index (BMI) is less than the 15th percentile, or whose actual weight is less than 85 percent of ideal body weight, is a candidate for referral for more intensive medical and psychological care. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Energy &ndash; The small stomach capacity of young children combined with low-caloric density foods may limit energy intake. To meet energy needs, children need three meals and three snacks per day. Both energy<strong>-</strong> and nutrient-dense foods should be included. The intake of fat should not be restricted in children younger than two years of age. For older children, some foods higher in unsaturated fats, such as nuts, seeds, nut and seed butters, and avocado, should be included to help meet nutrient and energy needs. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Energy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Omega-3 fatty acids &ndash; Vegetarian diets generally are rich in omega-6 (n-6) fatty acids, but marginal in omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids, which are important for cardiovascular health and eye and brain development. Vegetarians should include good sources of alpha-linolenic acid in their diet, such as flaxseed, walnuts, canola oil, and soy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Omega-3 fatty acids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein &ndash; Intake of essential amino acids may be a problem for infants if intake is limited to plant-based low-quality protein products. Protein intake should be adequate if vegan children eat a variety of complementary plant foods to meet caloric needs. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Protein'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron &ndash; Heme (meat) iron is more readily absorbed than is non-heme iron, the absorption of which is adversely affected by other dietary constituents. Growing children who consume only non-heme iron are at risk of iron deficiency. A source of ascorbic acid should be provided at each meal to significantly enhance the absorption of non-heme iron. Teas containing tannin should be limited. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Iron'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zinc &ndash; The zinc in vegetarian diets has a lower bioavailability than that in omnivorous diets because of the high content of phytate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dietary fiber. The clinical importance of reduced intake in vegan children is not known. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Zinc'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium &ndash; Milk and other dairy products provide approximately 75 percent of the calcium in the average American diet. Vegetarian children who do not drink milk should receive at least one calcium-rich or fortified food at each meal and with several snacks each day to provide a daily calcium intake that approximates 700 mg for children one to three years, 1000 mg if they are four to eight years, and 1300 mg if they are nine years and older. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Calcium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin D &ndash; Most foods do not contain any vitamin D. The principal dietary source of vitamin D for omnivores, lacto-ovovegetarians, and lactovegetarians is fortified milk. A vitamin D intake of 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/day</span> is necessary for adequate calcium balance. This balance can be provided by using soy milk or breakfast cereal fortified with calcium and vitamin D. Fatty fish can provide a source of vitamin D for macrobiotic children, particularly during winter. Vitamin D supplementation should be used for children without adequate sunlight exposure or dietary intake from enriched foods. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin D'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin B12 &ndash; Animal products (meat and dairy products) provide the only dietary source of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) for humans. Vegan children and other vegetarians whose diets do not contain adequate vitamin B12 should consume a regular and reliable source of the vitamin, either fortified foods (soy milk or cereals) or an oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin B12</a> supplement. Provision of fish two to three times per week can provide a source of vitamin B12 for macrobiotic children. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin B12'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fiber &ndash; Fiber intake for children should be age-appropriate and approximate the currently recommended DRI. The mineral content of the diet should be adequate. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Fiber'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vegetarian-diets-for-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Craig WJ.
