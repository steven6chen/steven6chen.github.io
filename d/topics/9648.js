The urinary tract is a group of organs that includes the ureter, bladder, and urethra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65630\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65630 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Kidney stones are made of salts and minerals that are normally in the urine. Sometimes, these salts and minerals clump together and form small stones. Children can get kidney stones, just as adults can.</p><p>Kidney stones are usually carried out of the body when a child urinates. But sometimes a kidney stone gets stuck on the way out. If this happens, the child can have pain, blood in the urine, and other symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10104481\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of kidney stones?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the belly or back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the urine, which can make urine pink or red</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain when the child urinates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need to urinate in a hurry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being irritable and crying when urinating (in small children)</p><p/><p>Some children with kidney stones do not have any symptoms. In these children, doctors often find the kidney stones by accident. This can happen if a child has an imaging test, such as an X-ray, for another reason.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10104496\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your child has the symptoms listed above, take him or her to the doctor or nurse as soon as possible. Kidney stones can block urine flow and cause infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10104511\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and order tests on a sample of your child's urine. He or she will also order an imaging test, such as a CT scan, ultrasound, or X-ray. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. They can show if a kidney stone is causing the symptoms. If your child has a stone, imaging tests can also show its size and where it is located.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10104528\"><span class=\"h1\">How are kidney stones treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is different for each child. The right treatment depends on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size, type, and location of the stone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much pain the child has</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child is vomiting, and how much</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child can drink large amounts of fluids</p><p/><p>If the stone is small and causes only mild symptoms, the child might be able to stay home and wait for it to pass in the urine on its own. If your child stays home, he or she will probably need to drink a lot of fluids. He or she might also need an over-the-counter medicine for pain, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin). The doctor might ask you to have your child urinate through a strainer so you can catch the stone when it comes out. The doctor or nurse can tell you how to do this.</p><p>A child might need treatment in the hospital if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stone is blocking urine flow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child has severe pain or is vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child cannot drink large amounts of fluid</p><p/><p>Hospital treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicine, either in pills or into a vein through an &quot;IV&quot; if the child is vomiting too much to keep pills down. An IV is a thin tube put into a vein through the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine to help pass the stone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids given into a vein through an IV</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment to remove the stone, or break it into smaller pieces so it can pass more easily. Doctors can do this with:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A machine that uses sound waves to break up stones into smaller pieces, called &quot;shock wave lithotripsy.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A special kind of surgery that is done through tiny holes in the skin &ndash; During this surgery, the doctor puts tiny tools through the holes and into the child's urinary tract or kidney. Then he or she removes the stone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A thin tube that goes into the body where the urine comes out &ndash; The tube has special tools on the end that doctors can use to break up stones or take them out.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10104543\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child have another kidney stone?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. If your child gets a kidney stone, he or she has a higher risk of getting another one later. To help keep this from happening, make sure your child drinks plenty of water.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will do tests to find out what caused the first stone. Depending on the results, you might need to change what your child eats. If so, the doctor or nurse can tell you which foods your child should not eat. He or she might also prescribe new medicines to keep your child from having another kidney stone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10104558\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Kidney stones in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
