A meta-analysis of 28 prospective cohort studies of physical activity and type 2 diabetes reported a lower risk of developing diabetes with 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/week</span> of moderate physical activity, including brisk walking, compared with being sedentary (relative risk 0.74, 95% CI 0.69-0.80) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

This approach allows greater flexibility and personal preference in diet and may improve long-term adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>There are few trials examining the effects of diet alone (without weight loss) for the prevention of diabetes. In one trial, a Mediterranean diet appeared to reduce the incidence of diabetes independent of weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. This trial, which included 7447 men and women, examined the effects of two different Mediterranean diets (one supplemented with extra virgin olive oil, the other with mixed nuts) versus a low-fat control diet on cardiovascular outcomes in men and women at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (eg, type 2 diabetes or three or more cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, BMI &ge;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> or family history of premature CVD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The incidence of diabetes could be ascertained (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] or two-hour oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] during follow-up, and if results consistent with diabetes, a repeat measurement within three months) in a subgroup of 3541 individuals without diabetes at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. After a median follow-up of four years, there was a decreased risk of developing diabetes in the groups assigned to the Mediterranean diets (80, 92, and 101 new cases of diabetes in the groups assigned to the Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil, Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts, and the control diet, respectively [HRs 0.60, 95% CI 0.43-0.85 and 0.82, 95% CI 0.61-1.10 for the olive oil and nut groups, respectively, compared with controls]). Changes in weight and physical activity did not differ among the three groups.</p><p>Although these results suggest that a Mediterranean diet reduces the incidence of diabetes independent of weight loss, they should be interpreted with caution, as this was an exploratory analysis of a trial in which randomization was not stratified by diabetes status and which was stopped early due to benefit. These limitations combined with the small number of events (273) and the greater losses to follow-up in the control group may have resulted in overestimation of benefit. In addition, it remains uncertain which components of the Mediterranean diet offer the protective benefit or if the benefits result from an aggregation of effects. There is no single definition of a Mediterranean diet, but such diets are typically high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and seeds; include olive oil as an important source of monounsaturated fat; and allow low to moderate wine consumption. There are typically low to moderate amounts of fish, poultry, and dairy products, with little red meat (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=healthy-diet-in-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Healthy diet in adults&quot;, section on 'Mediterranean diet'</a>). Randomized trials of Mediterranean diets with diabetes as a primary endpoint are needed before they can be recommended for the prevention of diabetes.</p><p>In another trial, the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial (WHI DMT), a low-fat diet (20 percent of caloric intake) did not reduce the incidence of diabetes compared with a usual diet (approximately 7 percent in each group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The difference in weight between the two groups was less than 2 kg. These results, which suffer from the absence of uniform glucose testing in the study, suggest that in average-risk women, a low-fat diet without weight reduction does not prevent diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several large, prospective, observational studies have shown that cigarette smoking increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. The effect of smoking cessation on diabetes risk is variable and may depend upon individual patient factors. Smoking cessation may reduce diabetes risk by reducing systemic inflammation. On the other hand, smoking cessation is often associated with weight gain, which will increase the risk of diabetes. This topic is reviewed in detail separately.

However, the impact on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors is less clear and varies with the individual drug. In addition, the long-term effects on cardiovascular events are unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Metformin reduced the rate of progression to diabetes (22 versus 29 percent with placebo at an average follow-up of three years). Metformin was effective in men and women and in all ethnic groups but was relatively ineffective in older patients and in those who were less overweight. Metformin was most effective in reducing the risk of diabetes in younger, obese subjects, and particularly in women with a history of gestational diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Although these drugs delay the onset of diagnosis of diabetes and therefore reduce the length of exposure of hyperglycemia, the benefit or harm of the intervention, independent of the effect on hyperglycemia, must be considered. As an example, thiazolidinediones are limited by adverse effects (fluid retention, weight gain, heart failure, possibly myocardial infarction [MI] for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a>, and possibly bladder cancer for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pioglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pioglitazone</a>) and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors by gastrointestinal side effects and poor long-term compliance. The use of thiazolidinediones, in particular, for the prevention of diabetes, may cause more net harm than benefit.

There are few data evaluating the ability of bariatric surgery to prevent diabetes in obese individuals.

After 15 years, type 2 diabetes developed in 110 and 392 patients in the surgery and control groups, respectively (incidence rates of 6.8 and 28.4 cases per 1000 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Baseline body mass index (BMI) did not influence the effect of bariatric surgery on the incidence of diabetes.

In addition, 31 percent of patients had not yet been followed for 15 years. Thus, the unadjusted 15-year participation rate was only 32.9 percent. The potential mechanisms for improvement in insulin resistance and beta cell function after bariatric surgery are uncertain and include a reduction in caloric intake, weight loss, and anatomic changes as a result of malabsorptive procedures.
