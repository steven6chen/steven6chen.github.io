Although the underlying problem often cannot be treated, extensive studies in experimental animals and humans suggest that progression in CKD may be largely due to secondary factors that are sometimes unrelated to the activity of the initial disease. These include systemic and intraglomerular hypertension, glomerular hypertrophy, the intrarenal precipitation of calcium phosphate, hyperlipidemia, and altered prostanoid metabolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56817 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>The major histologic manifestation of these secondary causes of renal injury is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, which is called secondary FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, glomerular damage and proteinuria typically occur with progressive renal failure, even in primary tubulointerstitial diseases such as chronic pyelonephritis due to reflux nephropathy.

A dramatic illustration of the importance of renal perfusion pressure comes from observations of patients with glomerular disease (eg, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis or diabetic nephropathy) who have concurrent unilateral renal artery stenosis. These patients can develop unilateral glomerular disease as the hypoperfused kidney is relatively protected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64632\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64632 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>An increase in intraglomerular pressure has been demonstrated in many animal models of progressive renal failure in association with a compensatory increase in filtration in the preserved nephrons (called glomerular hyperfiltration); indirect studies suggest that a similar response occurs in humans. At least three factors contribute to these changes in renal hemodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A compensatory response to nephron loss in an attempt to maintain the total glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

The fall in GFR is minimized in this by raising the intraglomerular pressure, a response that may be mediated by reduced flow to the macula densa and subsequent activation of tubuloglomerular feedback (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F73046\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73046 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p/><p>A compensatory increase in glomerular size also may occur in these settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This change can contribute to glomerular injury by further increasing wall stress.</p><p>The mechanisms by which glomerular hypertension and hypertrophy induce glomerular injury are incompletely understood as multiple factors may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct endothelial cell damage, similar to that induced by systemic hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increased wall stress and increased glomerular diameter may cause detachment of the glomerular epithelial cells from the glomerular capillary wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,26</a>]. These focal areas of denudation permit increased flux of water and solutes; however, very large circulating macromolecules (such as immunoglobulin M [IgM] and fibrinogen and complement metabolites) cannot cross the glomerular basement membrane and are trapped in the subendothelial space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The characteristic accumulation of these &quot;hyaline&quot; deposits can progressively narrow the capillary lumens, thereby decreasing glomerular perfusion and filtration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased strain on the mesangial cells can stimulate them to produce cytokines and more extracellular matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27,28</a>]. The ensuing mesangial expansion can further encroach on the capillary surface area. The release of cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and isoforms of platelet-derived growth factor may also contribute to the glomerular injury, in part by mediating the rise in matrix synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/27,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,30</a>].</p><p/><p>Experimental studies suggest that TGF-beta may contribute to matrix production and the development of glomerulosclerosis in a variety of renal diseases. As demonstrated in an animal model, lowering the glomerular pressure with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor prevents the increase in cytokine gene expression and may result in regression of glomerulosclerosis if less than 50 percent of the glomerulus is affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/24,27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27,31</a>].

This change is often underappreciated, but both the GFR and long-term prognosis are more closely related to the degree of tubulointerstitial, rather than glomerular, injury.

Dietary protein restriction and the use of antihypertensive agents (particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) have been most widely studied and are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-recommendations-for-patients-with-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary recommendations for patients with nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the potential importance of intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy, the following factors also may contribute to secondary renal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presence of proteinuria (&gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> alone may contribute to disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Proposed mechanisms include mesangial toxicity, tubular overload and hyperplasia, toxicity from specific filtered compounds such as <span class=\"nowrap\">transferrin/iron</span> and albumin-bound fatty acids, and induction of proinflammatory molecules such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP) and inflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/32,36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36-40</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Tubulointerstitial fibrosis'</a> below.)</p><p>It is possible, for example, that a marked increase in protein filtration and subsequent proximal reabsorption leads to tubular cell injury and the release of lysozymes into the interstitium. To the degree that proteinuria alone might be important, reversing intraglomerular hypertension with protein restriction or antihypertensive therapy may be beneficial both by diminishing hemodynamic injury to the glomeruli and by reducing protein filtration (which is in part dependent upon the intraglomerular pressure), thereby lowering proteinuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'The proteinuric response as a predictor of outcome'</a>.)</p><p>Other strategies to reduce proteinuria have been tried. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a>, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, may reduce proteinuria in those with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Thiazolidinediones may also reduce proteinuria in both diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Reducing proteinuria, especially if in the nephrotic range, is associated with improved management of edema but has not been validated as a surrogate for slowing nephropathy progression, since it is confounded by other validated surrogates such as blood pressure reduction and good glycemic control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Podocyte injury or loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations in podocyte function may be associated with proteinuria. Furthermore, podocyte loss via apoptosis may be important in the development of glomerulosclerosis, both in primary and secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/45-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-50</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis of primary FSGS'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Tubulointerstitial fibrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All forms of chronic renal disease are associated with marked tubulointerstitial injury (tubular dilatation, interstitial fibrosis), even if the primary process is a glomerulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Furthermore, the degree of tubulointerstitial disease is a better predictor of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and long-term prognosis than is the severity of glomerular damage in almost all chronic progressive glomerular diseases, including IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and lupus nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/52-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-57</a>]. It is possible in these settings that tubulointerstitial disease causes tubular atrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obstruction, eventually leading to nephron loss.</p><p>The mechanism by which tubulointerstitial fibrosis develops is incompletely understood. It may involve rarefaction of peritubular vessels induced by hypoxia or other antiangiogenic stimuli, plus the production of proinflammatory cytokines by tubular epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. These cytokines promote renal accumulation of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Infiltration of the kidney by macrophage and T lymphocytes (and perhaps bone marrow-derived fibroblast-like cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,59-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,59-66</a>] and the <span class=\"nowrap\">G2/M</span> phase cell cycle arrest of proximal tubular epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>] may upregulate transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and other profibrotic cytokines that are central to the development of this process.</p><p>Other possible contributors include calcium-phosphate deposition and metabolic acidosis with secondary interstitial ammonia accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,68</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Phosphate retention'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic acidosis and increased ammonium production'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Angiotensin II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonhemodynamic effects of angiotensin II also appear to contribute to the development of tubulointerstitial fibrosis, mediated via one of the angiotensin II type 1 receptors that are present in the glomerulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Animal studies have suggested that activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1B, which is largely limited to the glomerulus, but not type 1A, may accelerate renal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. This effect is likely due to the generation of profibrotic factors such as TGF-beta, connective tissue growth factor, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and other chemokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Further support for this role is provided by the finding that the expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptors in podocytes is associated with FSGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. It also appears that renin may lead to a receptor-mediated increase in TGF-beta that is independent of angiotensin II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Actions of angiotensin II may also be mediated via EGF receptors, which are present throughout the nephron and, when stimulated, promote cell proliferation and collagen production via TGF-alpha, EGF, and other growth factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. In experimental models, infusion of angiotensin II induces glomerulosclerosis and tubular atrophy. This effect is not seen in mice lacking EGF receptors or TGF-alpha, and pharmacologic inhibition of angiotensin II prevented these renal lesions.</p><p>Angiotensin II also participates in cytokine- and chemokine-mediated recruitment of inflammatory cells into the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunologic processes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is also evidence that an active immunologic process is involved in the glomerulonephritides, beginning early in the course of the disease and, in some cases, being an extension of the inflammation in the glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/52,59,60,76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,59,60,76-78</a>]. As an example, the release of cytokines induced by immune activation results in the upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the capillary endothelial cells; ICAM-1 can then bind to lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), a receptor on activated T cells, leading to T-cell adhesion and subsequent migration into the interstitium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. In some experimental models of renal disease, corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy can ameliorate the tubulointerstitial damage (without effect on the glomerular injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/80-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-83</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion in the pathogenesis of inflammation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The trafficking and deposition of excess filtered protein may be one link between initial glomerular injury and the development of immunologic tubulointerstitial disease. The correlation between these pathologic findings was examined in different animal models of renal disease, including the remnant kidney and passive Heymann nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Soon after the onset of renal injury in rats with both disorders, collections of protein (consisting of albumin and immunoglobulin) accumulated at specific sites in the proximal tubule; subsequently, infiltrates were only detected at or around the tubules containing these proteins. Although the interstitial inflammation became more irregularly distributed over time, the early relationship between inflammatory foci and proximal tubule protein deposition persisted to some extent. Enhanced levels of osteopontin (a hematopoietic cell chemoattractant expressed by affected tubule cells), chemokines, and platelet-derived growth factor may be some of the mediators underlying the inflammatory lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>In the remnant kidney model, administration of an ACE inhibitor prevents protein deposition in the renal tubules; this limits the tubular accumulation of complement components and immunoglobulin G (IgG), thereby ameliorating interstitial inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Multiple additional animal models further support a connection between proteinuria and complement-mediated inflammation and damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. The addition of an immunosuppressive agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, to the ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin II receptor antagonist) further lowers overall hematopoietic cell infiltration and proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-91</a>].</p><p>Ongoing inflammatory disease may be suggested by increased levels of markers of inflammation, which may be associated with progression of renal disease. Among nearly 600 older patients, for example, higher levels of C-reactive protein, factor VII, fibrinogen, and other markers were associated with a rise in the serum creatinine concentration and decrease in the estimated GFR (eGFR) over a follow-up period of seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. There is no consensus approach to assess the degree of severity of inflammation in individuals with kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Effective therapy of the ongoing renal inflammation may not prevent progressive scarring if significant injury has already occurred.
