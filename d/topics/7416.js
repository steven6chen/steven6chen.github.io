Worldwide, there are an estimated 1,600,000 new cases of prostate cancer and 366,000 prostate cancer deaths annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follow-up-surveillance-during-and-after-treatment-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Because of the prolonged natural history, there are a large number of cancer survivors who are being followed after initial definitive treatment, as well as men who have presented with or developed evidence of advanced disease. Those with advanced disease include men whose only evidence of advanced disease is an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), as well as those with clinically detectable metastases, which may be either asymptomatic or symptomatic.</p><p>This topic will discuss the approach to follow-up both in those without evidence of disease after treatment and those with evidence of advanced disease. The follow-up of men with low-risk localized prostate cancer who are managed with active surveillance is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Active surveillance for men with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Surveillance strategy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7449313\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer undergo definitive therapy with curative intent (eg, radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy [RT], brachytherapy, cryotherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound). Most patients with low-risk disease can be managed with active surveillance, with definitive therapy deferred until there is evidence of progressive disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=active-surveillance-for-men-with-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Active surveillance for men with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients who subsequently progress with either local or disseminated disease, recurrence generally is detected by a rise in the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a highly specific marker for prostate tissue, prior to any radiologic or symptomatic evidence of recurrence or progression. The development of an overt local recurrence or distant metastases usually occurs significantly later in the natural history of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H11086781\" class=\"local\">'Serum PSA'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-metastases-in-advanced-prostate-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H19253279\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>There are no randomized trials that have defined the optimal follow-up strategy for men following initial treatment for localized prostate cancer. Regular monitoring of the serum PSA is indicated following definitive therapy, with possible early intervention if a recurrence is detected since many recurrences following initial treatment can be successfully treated. The natural history of many prostate cancers from the time of biochemical recurrence to symptomatic disease or death is often prolonged. As such, not all biochemical failures require aggressive treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'Risk of metastases or death'</a>.)</p><p>When considering surveillance strategies for prostate cancer, the impact of therapy for recurrent disease on both overall survival and quality of life (QOL) should be discussed with the patient. The patient's individual preferences and overall health status are of primary importance in choosing a surveillance strategy after treatment for localized prostate cancer. If a man does not desire additional treatment or if his life expectancy is limited due to comorbid conditions, early detection of recurrent disease would only cause psychological distress and could detract from QOL while not affecting overall survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11086744\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance strategies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11086752\"><span class=\"h3\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of recurrences following radical prostatectomy or RT for localized prostate cancer are asymptomatic and manifested only by a rising serum PSA. While regular physician visits may serve to reassure the patient, they are of questionable utility in detecting recurrent tumor. Nevertheless, periodic evaluation by a health care provider is important to evaluate potential complications of therapy and for overall health care. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2364553149\"><span class=\"h4\">Digital rectal examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring serum PSA, rather than digital rectal examination (DRE), is the &quot;gold standard&quot; for early detection of recurrence following definitive local therapy in patients with localized prostate cancer. The value of serial DRE in this setting is unclear, particularly after surgery. However, DRE is considered a regular component of the physical examination since it is inexpensive and has little or no risk associated with it.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following radical prostatectomy, the prostatic fossa should be empty on DRE. However, DRE is not sensitive enough to detect local recurrence early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follow-up-surveillance-during-and-after-treatment-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 501 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy, 72 had a rising PSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follow-up-surveillance-during-and-after-treatment-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Only 4 of the 501 men (0.8 percent) had an abnormal DRE, and the PSA was elevated in each of these cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In men treated initially with RT, the role of DRE is also unclear. DRE was used routinely prior to the availability of PSA, but this outcome is now seldom reported. However, the clinical significance of a change in DRE following RT is unclear. Furthermore, there is considerable intraobserver variability in assessing change in DRE, which limits the utility of this endpoint.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11086781\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum PSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum PSA is the mainstay of surveillance testing in men who have undergone therapy for localized prostate cancer. There are no clinical trials that define the optimal frequency for measuring serum PSA. Guidelines from the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=Uq9WYRsg9p/PSM9vt3rBGtHa7uSejixwk2tJVlS5LMeu0awaX/Er3fekhDozpt3zew+Yt0LRtO7qp5BoCEEM5YoFu3K3VNa+mIo9yk7LJGM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6928\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a> (NCCN) recommend that the serum PSA be monitored every 6 to 12 months for the first five years and annually thereafter.</p><p>Serum PSA is a sensitive marker for recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma in this setting and is elevated in 95 percent of men with recurrent disease. While the use of PSA for cancer screening is controversial, there is little debate that it is an excellent tumor marker in men with an established diagnosis of prostate cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-prostate-specific-antigen\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of prostate-specific antigen&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11086797\"><span class=\"h4\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of a PSA recurrence depends upon the initial treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; All prostate tissue is removed during a successful radical prostatectomy. Thus, any detectable PSA in the serum using the standard immunoassay (the typical limit of detection is 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> theoretically indicates remaining prostate tissue and presumably represents persistent or recurrent disease. Ultrasensitive PSA assays may detect lower levels of PSA, but the utility of basing treatment decisions on the much lower levels of PSA detected with these assays remains unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'After radical prostatectomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; The definition of a biochemical failure following RT is more complicated since there is benign prostate tissue remaining after RT. The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) has established guidelines to define PSA recurrence following RT. In the 2005 Phoenix criteria, a PSA rise of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or more above the nadir PSA is considered the standard definition for biochemical failure after external beam RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follow-up-surveillance-during-and-after-treatment-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These criteria are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'After radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The interpretation of an increase in serum PSA following RT is further complicated by the observation that serum PSA levels can fluctuate (&quot;bounce&quot;) significantly after RT (particularly brachytherapy) before returning toward the posttreatment nadir. Thus, increases in PSA must be interpreted with caution, and they do not necessarily indicate recurrence. The PSA bounce phenomenon is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-definition-natural-history-and-risk-stratification#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Definition, natural history, and risk stratification&quot;, section on 'PSA bounce'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11086864\"><span class=\"h4\">Natural history of PSA-only recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of prostate cancer in men with a PSA-only (biochemical) recurrence is often prolonged, and a biochemical recurrence alone is not necessarily an indication for therapy. Because PSA is a specific tumor marker following local therapy, the absence of a rise in PSA can provide significant psychological reassurance. If &quot;PSA-only failure&quot; occurs, other clinical characteristics, such as time to biochemical recurrence or PSA doubling time, can be used to counsel patients and to help guide treatment decisions regarding secondary therapy.

A variety of imaging studies are potentially useful for identifying the specific sites of recurrence in men with biochemical evidence of recurrence (rising PSA) or for evaluating symptoms suggestive of recurrent disease.

However, bone scan has been replaced by PSA testing for the early detection of asymptomatic recurrence. Contemporary guidelines from the European Association for Urology (EAU) suggest that bone scan can be omitted until the PSA is greater than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> although there is not uniform agreement on this recommendation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follow-up-surveillance-during-and-after-treatment-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study of 118 men who were followed with both serial bone scans and serum PSA after radical prostatectomy for localized disease, 75 percent had no evidence of disease by either study, 9 percent had an elevated PSA with a negative bone scan, and 9 percent had an abnormal bone scan, all of whom had an abnormal PSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follow-up-surveillance-during-and-after-treatment-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The remaining seven patients with positive or indeterminate bone scans and negative PSA were determined to have recurrent disease. </p><p>Bone scans are more likely to detect metastases when the serum PSA level is markedly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follow-up-surveillance-during-and-after-treatment-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, almost all men are evaluated when they are castration sensitive and the serum PSA is much lower (often &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>. In this setting, the bone scan is unlikely to identify bony metastases in the absence of symptoms referable to bone.

While there are no data to guide the frequency of clinician visits, it is common clinical practice to examine men at three to six-month intervals, which often coincide with the time of administration of long-acting gonadotrophin agonist therapy. Follow-up for men receiving chemotherapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabazitaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabazitaxel</a>) is more frequent.</p><p>Measurement of serum PSA in men with metastatic disease every three to six months is reasonable; more frequent evaluation, potentially including imaging studies, is indicated if the serum PSA begins to rise or the patient complains of symptoms. More frequent testing and imaging studies are often required for men participating in research protocols.</p><p>Although serial PSA testing in men with metastatic disease has not been shown to prolong life expectancy, rising PSA is an indication of treatment failure and development of castration-resistant disease, signaling the need to consider alternative therapies. Serial PSA testing can also provide reassurance to patients of a continuing response to treatment. Prostate cancer is considered castration-resistant when a patient is documented to have a rising PSA or radiographic evidence of progression in the setting of castrate levels of serum testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/follow-up-surveillance-during-and-after-treatment-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The onset of new symptoms during therapy may suggest the need for further diagnostic evaluation (eg, back pain with neurologic abnormalities due to spinal cord compression, bone pain due to pathologic fracture) or specific site-directed therapy (eg, radiation therapy to a painful bone metastasis).

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
