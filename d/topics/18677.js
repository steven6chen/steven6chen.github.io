Refractive errors occur when a component of the eye's optical system fails to focus the optical image.</p><p>This topic will cover the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of refractive errors in adults. Refractive errors in children and laser refractive treatment are discussed separately.

The lens provides the remaining one third, for a total refractive power of 60 diopters (D). Refractive power of the eye and corrective lenses is measured in diopters, where a diopter is the reciprocal of the focal length measured in meters. The focal length is the distance from a lens to its focus or focal point.</p><p>The cornea has a fixed amount of refractive power while the lens can vary its power by altering its shape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Accommodation is the term used to describe this change in lens shape, which can increase the power of the lens to enable the eye to focus on objects at arm's length or closer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Emmetropia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emmetropia (normal refraction) describes the refractive state in which parallel light rays emanating from an object located 20 feet or more from the eye form a focused image on the retina of an eye that has not accommodated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81157\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81157 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79812\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef79812 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ametropia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ametropia (abnormal refraction) refers to the refractive state in which the image is not focused on the retina. Refractive disorders are ametropic states in which the eye is unable to bring light rays emanating from an object viewed from a distance into clear focus on the retina, without the aid of a refractive device (eg, spectacles, contact lenses). Myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism are the three ametropic states. They are caused by abnormalities in the axial length of the eye or the shape of the cornea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Myopia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myopia (&quot;nearsightedness&quot;) is a common refractive disorder in which the axial length of the eye is either too long (axial length is the distance from the posterior corneal surface to the retina) or the refractive power of the eye's optical system is too great (generally due to a steep cornea). The image is focused in front of the retina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F65268\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65268 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69617\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef69617 \">movie 2</a>). This results in blurred distance vision unless optical correction is achieved with a refractive device. A refractive device can provide a more concave surface which reduces the excessive focusing power of the eye's optical system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80691\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80691 \">movie 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperopia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperopia (&quot;farsightedness&quot;) is a refractive disorder in which the axial length of the eye is too short or the power of the eye's optical system is insufficient (due to a flat cornea) to produce a focused image on the retina. The image is focused behind the retina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75265\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75265 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72862\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef72862 \">movie 4</a>). Hyperopia is corrected with a refractive device that provides a more convex refracting surface in order to increase the deficient focusing power of the eye's optical system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51690\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51690 \">movie 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Astigmatism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Astigmatism (&quot;lack of a pinpoint&quot; in Greek) refers to the refractive condition in which a warped corneal surface causes light rays entering the eye along different planes to be focused unevenly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61074\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef61074 \">movie 6</a>). The patient reports blurred vision at all viewing distances. Unlike myopia and hyperopia, which are corrected by spectacles containing a spherical surface, astigmatism is corrected by spectacles containing a cylindrical optical surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68083\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef68083 \">movie 7</a>). A spherical lens is a device with optical symmetry which can either converge or scatter light rays, while a cylindrical lens does not have optical symmetry. One meridian (a closed curve on the surface of a sphere) in the cylindrical lens is more curved than the opposite meridian. Soft (toric) or rigid gas permeable contact lenses can also be used to correct astigmatism. Contact lenses are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-contact-lenses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of contact lenses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Presbyopia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presbyopia (&quot;aging sight&quot;) is a non-refractive error that also affects visual acuity. Presbyopia occurs when the lens loses its normal accommodating power and can no longer focus on objects viewed at arm's length or closer. As such, it is not considered an ametropic state, but rather one in which the normal physiologic function of lens accommodation has been lost.</p><p>In youth, the eye is able to easily accommodate or increase the curvature of the lens by contracting the ciliary muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59910 \">figure 1</a>). The ciliary muscle surrounds the lens and is connected to it by zonular fibers. The normally taut zonular fibers stretch the lens and keep it from assuming a fully rounded state. The desire to focus on reading material automatically stimulates ciliary smooth muscle contraction, which loosens the zonular fibers and allows the lens to become more rounded. In the fully rounded state, the lens provides the additional refractive power needed to bring reading material into focus.</p><p>During the natural aging process, the crystalline lens loses its elasticity and therefore its ability to become more rounded when the zonular fibers loosen their grip. Presbyopia usually begins after age 40 when patients start to appreciate the inability to focus on objects at reading distance. In patients with presbyopia, the eye's focusing power for reading is lost progressively and fully by age 65 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The developing eye in childhood through early adulthood maintains focus on the retina by a process known as emmetropization. This process involves detection of a blurred image on the retina with subsequent diffusion of signals into the outer layers of the eye, including the choroid and sclera (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59910 \">figure 1</a>). This results in alteration of the size of the eye in order to maintain clear vision throughout development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Emmetropization is accomplished by modulating scleral growth and choroidal thickness. With refractive errors, the emmetropization process goes awry for reasons that remain largely unknown.</p><p>Cellular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physiologic mechanisms are thought to cause retinal defocusing with resulting altered axial length and myopia during the developmental process. In addition, eye growth is sensitive to an individual's visual experience.

Other studies have suggested that those with impaired vision are more likely to report a car accident within the last year, have symptoms of depression, and less likely to be working [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/45,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,52,53</a>]. </p><p>Patients with decreased vision are more likely to report a history of falls and hip fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Although visual correction may improve ability to read and perform other tasks, it does not appear to reduce risk or rate of falls among older adults. In one randomized trial, visual correction including new eyeglasses, glaucoma management, and cataract surgery led to an increased rate of falls compared to usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], possibly related to an adjustment period needed to adapt to new corrective eyeglasses, and a less sedentary lifestyle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated eye disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High degrees of refractive error (myopia &gt;6.0 D, hyperopia &gt;3.0 D, astigmatism &gt;3.0 D) are associated with pathologic ocular changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Highly myopic patients have an increased incidence of retinal thinning, peripheral retinal degeneration, retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], cataract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], and glaucoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].

Different organizations have different recommendations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends comprehensive eye examinations by ophthalmologists for adults with no signs or risk factors as a baseline at age 40 years. Individuals without risk factors age 40 to 54 years should be examined every two to four years, those age 55 to 63 every one to three years, and those over 65 every one to two years. Any patient at higher risk for developing disease, based on ocular, medical, or family history should have periodic examinations determined by individual risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination recommends the Snellen eye chart be used for visual acuity during routine primary care visits for patients age 65 and older, although the frequency of testing is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The US Preventive Services Task Force states there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening for impaired vision in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p>Visual screening tests are recommended in children, which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-tests-in-children-and-adolescents#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening tests in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Vision screen'</a>.)</p><p>There are a variety of visual charts to examine visual acuity, although little data is available showing superiority of one method over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The Snellen eye chart is considered one of the clinical standards for evaluating visual acuity, and can be used in the primary care setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50810\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50810 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-impairment-in-adults-refractive-disorders-and-presbyopia/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Patients should have their vision examined at 20 feet and while reading. While there is no explicit evidence regarding appropriate cutoffs for referral, patients with unexplained vision loss in either eye should be referred to an eye specialist for further evaluation.</p><p>Although refractive errors may be suspected on history of visual blurriness or by visual acuity testing, diagnosis of all refractive disorders is confirmed with use of a phoropter by the eye specialist. A phoropter is an instrument containing different lenses used to bring the focus of objects onto the retina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66741\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66741 \">picture 1</a>). In addition to diagnosis, a phoropter is also used to measure severity of refractive error for prescribing corrective lenses.</p><p>A retinoscope and pinhole occluder are additional devices that can be used to assess refractive error by an eye specialist. A retinoscope is an objective measure of refractive error that is not dependent upon patient response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55046\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55046 \">picture 2</a>). The retinoscope projects a beam of light into the patient's eye through the pupil. Through the peephole in the scope, the observer sees a light reflex coming from the patient's pupil. By observing the behavior of the reflex under certain conditions, the observer can objectively determine the refractive error of the patient's eye.</p><p>A pinhole occluder may also be used as a screening tool for refractive errors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66325\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66325 \">picture 3</a>). The occluder is a simple way to focus light, as in a pinhole camera, temporarily removing the effects of refractive errors such as myopia. Because light passes only through the center of the eye's lens, defects in the shape of the lens (errors of refraction) have no effect while the occluder is used. This can allow estimation of the maximum improvement in a patient's vision that can be attained by lenses to correct errors of refraction. Squinting works similarly to a pinhole occluder, by blocking light through the outer parts of the eye's lens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to treat refractive disorders depends on the individual patient's symptoms and needs. Treatment is aimed to improve visual acuity, visual comfort, and other visual function (eg, color discrimination, motion detection, peripheral vision).</p><p>First-line treatments include corrective lenses, such as glasses and contact lenses, or refractive surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Corrective lenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corrective lenses work by altering the overall power of the lens system of the eye. Concave lenses for myopia act to weaken the lens system, or reduce its power in diopters. Convex lenses for hyperopia act by strengthening the lens system, or increasing its power in diopters. Cylindrical lenses are used to correct astigmatism.</p><p>Presbyopia is treated with use of convex lenses as &quot;reading glasses&quot; or in combination with a correction for distance viewing in which the lenses may be lined (bifocals, trifocals) or unlined (multifocals, progressive).</p><p>Spectacles, or glasses, are the most common method of treating refractive errors, followed by contact lenses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-contact-lenses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of contact lenses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpreting the prescription</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By convention, lenses that increase divergence and decrease the eye's focusing power are considered &quot;minus&quot; lenses; lenses that increase convergence and increase focusing power are considered &quot;plus&quot; lenses. Accordingly, myopic refractive error is corrected with concave (&quot;minus&quot;, &quot;divergent&quot;) lenses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80691\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80691 \">movie 3</a>), and hyperopia is corrected with convex (&quot;plus&quot;, &quot;convergent&quot;) lenses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51690\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51690 \">movie 5</a>). Astigmatism is corrected by cylindrical lenses which even out the eye's focusing power (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68083\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef68083 \">movie 7</a>).</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>In spectacle prescription notation, the first number is the refractive power, also known as the sphere. A minus number indicates a concave lens; a plus number indicates a convex lens. The second number denotes the cylinder, which corrects any astigmatic component. The &quot;x&quot; that follows the astigmatism power denotes the axis (in radial degrees) of the cylinder. Spectacle prescriptions are then written in increments of 0.25 D. For example, a prescription for a patient with myopia and astigmatism may read -4.50 + 2.50 x 090 and a prescription for a patient with hyperopia and astigmatism may read +3.25 + 1.50 x 180.</p></div></div><p>OD signifies the right eye (oculus dexter in Latin).

OU signifies both eyes (oculi uterque).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical correction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common surgical procedure performed to correct refractive errors is laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Overall outcomes with LASIK are favorable, leading to rapid recovery of vision and minimal pain after surgery. Other corneal surgical procedures include photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), and laser epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK). Laser refractive procedures are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-refractive-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser refractive surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intraocular lens implants, similar to those used to correct vision with cataract surgery, can correct high degrees of myopia. However, intraocular lens implants can result in cataract formation, increased intraocular pressure, and damage to the cornea over time. Thus, lens implants are not routinely recommended for correction of refractive errors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
