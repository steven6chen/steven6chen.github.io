Increasing birth weight is associated with OASIS, and thus is likely to also be associated with fecal incontinence. One study examined this relationship directly; in a secondary analysis of the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study, larger birth weight was associated with fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H928370\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing maternal age at delivery has been associated with significantly higher rates of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) and postpartum fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence/abstract/5,67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,67-69</a>].

Interestingly, however, only 6.4 percent of the fecal incontinence in the study subjects could be attributed to the original sphincter laceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 30-year retrospective cohort study reported no difference in fecal incontinence among three groups of women: those who delivered vaginally and had a sphincter laceration; those who delivered vaginally with episiotomy and no sphincter laceration; and those who delivered by cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>Similarly, in a study of over 2600 women in their 50s, the prevalence of fecal incontinence was similar for nulliparous, primiparous, and multiparous women: 11, 9, and 9 percent, respectively.

In general, it appears that in women with previous OASIS, vaginal delivery increases the short-term risk of persistent fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>]. The presence of transient incontinence after sphincter laceration and repair is also predictive of the likelihood of developing persistent incontinence with a subsequent delivery.

In contrast, women who sustain a second OASIS do appear to have an increased risk of long-term anal and fecal incontinence. In a secondary analysis of data from a questionnaire survey, women with a second OASIS had a nearly 70 percent increased risk of anal incontinence and nearly double the risk of fecal incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

Clinicians and patients still need to address the risk. Considerations include mode of delivery, role of assisted vaginal delivery and episiotomy, and perineal massage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient choice cesarean delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of primary patient choice cesarean delivery for the prevention of fecal incontinence is a topic of debate. There is insufficient evidence to support primary cesarean delivery for this indication. Research findings, while controversial, suggest no difference in long-term rates of fecal incontinence when cesarean delivery is performed, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H928518\" class=\"local\">'Vaginal versus cesarean delivery'</a> above.)</p><p>The Term Breech Trial evaluated mode of delivery for singleton breech fetuses and is the only large randomized trial (n = 1159) that assigned women to planned cesarean or planned vaginal delivery. The overall prevalence of fecal incontinence was 2.2 percent and planned cesarean delivery conferred no protection against fecal incontinence compared with planned vaginal delivery (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.47-2.58) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Limitations of this trial were that only 21 women developed fecal incontinence and almost one-half of the women in the planned vaginal delivery group underwent cesarean birth. In addition, many participants were multiparous, having already delivered vaginally. Further, the rate of fecal incontinence in this study was lower than is generally reported. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9411967\"><span class=\"h3\">Women with prior anal sphincter laceration or fecal incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are insufficient high quality data to provide guidance regarding the delivery mode of a woman with a history of a sphincter laceration. Women with transient anal incontinence symptoms following an initial delivery have a one in six chance of developing permanent symptoms following a subsequent vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. It is estimated that 2 to 23 cesarean deliveries would need to be performed in women with prior obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) to prevent a single recurrent anal sphincter laceration. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence with subsequent vaginal delivery'</a> above.)</p><p>Experts advise that a woman with persistent fecal incontinence and a poorly functioning anal sphincter be offered a planned cesarean for subsequent deliveries. In counseling a woman with a history of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS), it is important to explain the uncertainties regarding risk of recurrent or persistent anal incontinence, as well as operative risks associated with cesarean delivery.

However, there is inadequate evidence upon which to base a recommendation for use of either vacuum or forceps for all circumstances when operative vaginal delivery is attempted.

Similar to operative vaginal delivery, median episiotomy is a known and modifiable risk factor for anal sphincter tear. Mediolateral episiotomy may also extend into an anal sphincter laceration; however, this occurs frequently with extension of a mediolateral episiotomy, but less frequently than with median episiotomy.

A systematic review including three randomized trials of antenatal perineal massage (for at least the last four weeks of pregnancy) revealed no difference in postpartum fecal or flatal incontinence compared to no antenatal perineal massage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4270095939\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of second stage of delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least one study suggests that bundled interventions in the second stage may reduce the incidence of third- and fourth-degree lacerations. In a prospective study of a quality improvement project, a three-part intervention reduced the incidence of third- and fourth-degree lacerations from 4.7 to 2.2 percent over a 12-month period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. The intervention consisted of avoidance of the semi-recumbent position for the mother, use of coaching to promote less expulsive pushing during crowning, and use of single-hand control to slow delivery of the head followed by spontaneous delivery of the shoulders. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">REPAIR OF ANAL SPHINCTER LACERATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary sphincter repair (immediately after delivery) is important to minimize the risk of fecal incontinence.
