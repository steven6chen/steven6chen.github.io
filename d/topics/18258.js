This inflammatory process causes pain, swelling (and in some instances redness) of the joint, frequently associated with reduced mobility and functional impairment; moreover, in some diseases damage to cartilage and bone can ensue, leading to joint destruction. Inflammatory arthritis contrasts from osteoarthritis, which is regarded a degenerative joint disease, or mere arthralgia which may have many causes. In many non-English speaking countries, the term &ldquo;inflammatory arthritis&rdquo; is regarded as pleonastic, since the term &ldquo;arthritis&rdquo; as an &ldquo;-itis&rdquo; already indicates inflammation, and other diseases, such as osteoarthritis, are named &ldquo;arthrosis.&rdquo; However, for the sake of this review and for clarity we will retain the term. </p><p>The term &rdquo;undifferentiated arthritis&rdquo; (UA) is used here to describe patients with undifferentiated early inflammatory arthritis, typically between six weeks and a year in duration, although a diagnosis can often be determined within three months and only infrequently requires as long as a year to become evident. Many such patients will eventually be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after further evolution of the symptoms and findings.</p><p>Inflammation is generally reversible, while joint destruction is not; and early and appropriate treatment before a definitive diagnosis can be established may prevent disease persistence, joint damage, and the disability and disease comorbidities associated with the ongoing disease process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>]. Early treatment, even without a definitive diagnosis, may also be of benefit because the immunopathologic events mediating the disease process, as in RA, may evolve and differ in later stages from the changes in early disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cartilage and bone injury, including erosions, may occur early in the disease course, be irreversible once present, and be associated in RA with greater disease severity, possibly by several mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Whether there is an early &ldquo;window of opportunity&rdquo; for inducing remission in RA and other inflammatory arthritides remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The evaluation and management of patients with UA will be presented here.

Specific diagnoses could be made at presentation in about 70 percent of such patients, the most common being rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the incidence of undifferentiated arthritis (UA) ranged from 41 to 149 per 100,000 adults, typically about 30 percent of the cohort. The most common diagnosis eventually made in patients with UA is RA, although this is in only about one-third of the patients; the remaining patients have osteoarthritis, other defined forms of arthritis, or remain undifferentiated, while some undergo spontaneous remission.

Patients whose diagnosis cannot then be established upon evaluation by an expert in rheumatologic disease can be viewed as having an undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis.</p><p>The frequency of subsequent specialist care depends upon the severity of symptoms and joint inflammation, the patient&rsquo;s response to treatment, the complexity and risks associated with the therapy, the preferences of the patient and primary care clinician, and the availability of a rheumatologist. Patients with acute or chronic forms of arthritis have been found to receive better care when assessed and treated by rheumatologists than generalists, both in terms of an earlier specific diagnosis and better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>].

These include the use of defined criteria for referral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]; the availability of ready access to the specialists by use of early arthritis clinics, which can reduce the waiting time from contacting the rheumatologist until patients are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]; and immediate-access clinics, where patients are seen by an experienced rheumatologist immediately upon (self-)referral for a brief initial assessment, followed by recommendation and referral for a more detailed rheumatology evaluation, if appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H366390477\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis do not represent a single disorder in the same sense that a diagnosis of a rheumatologic disease such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) identifies a disease; rather, undifferentiated arthritis (UA) is a diagnosis of exclusion made in patients with arthritis (a sign <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptom of disease), which has caused at least one clinically swollen joint in the absence of further abnormalities sufficient to meet criteria for a specified alternative diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H366390500\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>An inflamed swollen joint is characterized by soft, rather than hard, tissue swelling along the joint margins due to a joint effusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> synovial thickening, usually with some fluctuation upon physical examination. Inflamed swollen joints may be warm and tender, and are sometimes erythematous. The requirement for the presence of at least one clinically swollen joint is similar to the entry requirement for the use of the 2010 American College of Rheumatology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACR)/European</span> League against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for RA.

In patients without at least one readily identified clinically involved joint, such studies are less useful, as changes on US may also be present in other diseases and in healthy persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The prognostic implications in RA of MRI changes, including synovitis and erosions, are uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/49,54-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,54-58</a>], since their meaning regarding long-term outcomes has not yet been established despite many years of research; however, bone marrow edema in the absence of erosions appears to indicate the presence of microscopic erosions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]; thus, the presence of bone marrow edema implies that the destructive process in bone has extended into the bone marrow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On the other hand, erosions detected by MRI can be observed in patients with early arthritis to a similar extent to findings in patients with SLE and Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, two diseases in which erosive joint disease is not generally seen by plain radiography, raising further questions regarding the meaning of such MRI findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Sensitive imaging techniques may be helpful in a research setting in defining &ldquo;pre-clinical arthritis&rdquo; and allowing the study of therapies to prevent the development of clinically overt arthritis, but there is a lack of evidence to support the use of such techniques for this purpose in routine clinical practice. Nonetheless, although the ACR-EULAR RA classification criteria require the presence of at least one clinically swollen joint, additional joint involvement that may lend further support to classification as having RA can come from imaging findings using ultrasonography or MRI. Overall, the approach described here is consistent with and partly exceeds multinational recommendations for the evaluation of patients with undifferentiated arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H366390500\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal diagnosis that should be considered in patients who appear to have undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis is rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The goal of early therapy, before being able to make a definitive diagnosis, is the suppression of inflammation and the prevention of persistent or recurrent inflammation and joint damage; this goal is most likely to be fulfilled by timely treatment of a patient with undifferentiated arthritis (UA) with a regimen that can achieve disease remission, as it cannot be determined at presentation which patients with UA will develop persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> destructive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

This approach is supported by a 2013 systematic review of drug therapy in UA that identified several randomized trials, open-label studies, and cohort studies, most of which included a substantial number of patients with early RA, which taken together suggested that temporary treatment with MTX, combination DMARDs, glucocorticoids and other agents were more effective than placebo in suppressing disease activity and radiographic progression, although the degree of long-term benefit from early treatment was uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One randomized trial suggested that treatment with MTX, compared with placebo, in patients somewhat similar to those defined here as having UA, may delay but not prevent the development of RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This trial involved 110 patients who met the modified 1958 American Rheumatism Association (ARA, subsequently the ACR) classification criteria for probable RA, but did not meet the 1987 ACR classification criteria for RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Treatment with MTX (titrated from 15 mg up to a maximum of 30 mg weekly in patients with a DAS &gt;2.4) for 12 months resulted in a significantly smaller proportion of patients being diagnosed with RA (by the 1987 criteria) during the initial 12-month treatment phase of the trial and during 18 months of further follow-up (40 versus 53 percent). Additionally, treatment with MTX delayed the evolution to RA (by the 1987 criteria), as half of the MTX-treated patients diagnosed with RA did not meet diagnostic criteria for RA during the first year, while all the patients receiving placebo who were diagnosed with RA met the criteria during that year. MTX-treated patients also exhibited less radiographic progression. However, later in the course of the disease there were neither major clinical nor radiographic differences between UA patients treated with MTX or placebo early on [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Estimates in the subgroup analysis of ACPA-positive and -negative patients were very imprecise, given the small numbers of patients in each group, but showed statistically significant benefits of MTX treatment only in the ACPA-positive subgroup, providing some support for our approach of using an alternative agent to MTX, such as SSZ, in ACPA-negative patients without clinical findings more suggestive of RA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of MTX (dose titrated to 25 mg weekly) and high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (tapered from 60 mg to 7.5 mg daily), for induction of remission (DAS remission, which is defined as a DAS less than 1.6), and the use of either of two combination therapy protocols in patients who did not meet remission criteria after four months, resulted in comparable benefit in patients with RA and patients with UA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. The trial involved 610 patients with either early RA (n = 479, with RA defined by 2010 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACR/EULAR</span> criteria and symptoms for less than two years) or UA (n = 122, defined as one arthritic joint and one painful joint, and suspected by a rheumatologist as having early RA, while not meeting RA classification criteria). At four months, similar proportions of patients with either early RA or UA achieved remission (61 versus 65 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients in early DAS remission (at four months) were tapered off <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, and those in continued DAS remission at eight months were tapered off MTX. Patients not in early DAS remission were randomly assigned to receive either traditional DMARD triple therapy (MTX [25 mg once weekly], HCQ [400 mg daily], and SSZ [2000 mg daily]) plus prednisone (7.5 mg daily), or MTX plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> (40 mg every other week); a similar fraction of patients in each arm of the trial achieved DAS remission by eight months (36 and 35 percent). Patients in DAS remission at eight months were tapered off conventional synthetic or biologic DMARDs other than MTX. Patients on triple therapy who were not in remission at eight months were switched to MTX plus adalimumab, and those already on adalimumab who were not in remission increased their adalimumab dose from every other week to weekly. Overall, remission and drug-free DAS remission were achieved in 68 and 32 percent of patients in these protocols after one year; the proportions of patients with early RA and UA who achieved DAS remission at one year while following these protocols were similar (53 and 58 percent). The proportion of all patients meeting <span class=\"nowrap\">ACR/EULAR</span> remission criteria was only 24 percent, with drug-free remission in 21 percent, including 30 percent of the patients with UA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Serious adverse events (SAE), including two deaths, occurred in <span class=\"nowrap\">14/610</span> patients during the first four months of the trial; and SAE were seen in 26 of the patients, including three deaths, during months 4 to 12. SAE included malignancies and their complications, serious infections, cardiovascular disease, and other causes leading to hospitalization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additionally, data from randomized trials and other studies support the long-term benefits of early intervention with DMARDs in limiting progression of disease in patients with RA, further supporting the likely benefit of these approaches in UA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-management-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H111269724\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of management of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Early use of DMARDs'</a>). In RA, a delayed start of DMARDs increases the risk of joint damage, which is irreversible, and the risk of disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>].</p><p/><p>Moreover, the underlying immunologic profile (the pattern of cell types and cytokines found in the synovial membrane) may differ in very early RA from that in later stages of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>]; a window of opportunity related to these immune characteristics may exist even in UA, given that UA may constitute an early state of RA in a considerable number of patients. During this period, treatment could be more effective than if it were delayed, resulting in a greater possibility of a biologic-free (and occasionally traditional DMARD-free) remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/13,93-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,93-96</a>]. Further, the risk of inadequately controlled arthritis also includes systemic effects, such as future cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, which may be fostered and aggravated by the inflammatory state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/8,97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,97,98</a>], particularly in patients with positive testing for RF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">99,100</a>].</p><p>The risks of MTX or SSZ are generally modest, and their adverse effects are well recognized, with many decades of experience in the use of these agents and in the monitoring, prevention, and management of their risks (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sulfasalazine: Pharmacology, administration, and adverse effects in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-pharmacology-administration-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sulfasalazine: Pharmacology, administration, and adverse effects in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Desensitization'</a>). Most side effects are recognized and managed easily when patients are well-informed and regularly monitored (see <a href=\"#H3466741\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below). Interestingly, it is rare to see new adverse events occurring after three months of therapy, unless doses are changed or other comorbidities develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Importantly, the risks of NSAIDs alone may be substantial, including gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk, and the risk of adverse effects on renal function.

While good outcomes can also be achieved with biological agents, we would usually regard initiating DMARD therapy with biologics as overtreatment for UA, since many patients will fare well on conventional synthetic DMARDs combined with glucocorticoids even in established RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/87,105-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,105-107</a>]; we reserve the use of such agents, as in RA, for patients with an inadequate response to initial therapies, especially those with an elevated risk of joint injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H91063762\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to initial therapy'</a> below.) We also usually do not combine synthetic DMARDs at the start of therapy, since these have not been unequivocally shown to be superior to monotherapy in this population or at this time point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/84,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,108</a>], and it is usually the glucocorticoid component that conveys the primary added benefit in most studies of initial combination therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/undifferentiated-early-inflammatory-arthritis-in-adults/abstract/109-112\" class=\"abstract_t\">109-112</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91063762\"><span class=\"h3\">Resistant to initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients resistant to initial therapy, defined as failure to achieve either a 50 percent reduction in disease activity after three months of DMARD therapy, or low disease activity or remission after six months of such treatment (see <a href=\"#H20394522\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic target'</a> above), the choice of DMARD therapy is based upon which medications have already been tried, the serologic findings, and the level of disease activity. Most patients should also be treated with NSAIDs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low-dose glucocorticoids to help control disease activity temporarily until the DMARDs are effective. (See <a href=\"#H156627050\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive role of antiinflammatory agents'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with UA resistant to initial therapies, we generally take one of the following approaches, depending upon the treatment history, the presence of RF or ACPA, and severity of disease activity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MTX resistant with upper extremity seronegative disease</strong> &ndash; In patients with upper-extremity disease but without RF or ACPA, who have had an inadequate response to MTX, we suggest sequential DMARD monotherapy with another agent (usually SSZ or LEF) or triple therapy with MTX, SSZ (up to 2000 mg daily), and HCQ.

For all these therapies, a similar goal for the treatment response would be sought: improvement within three months and remission or low disease activity at six months. If these goals are not met, the use of a bDMARD or a second bDMARD may be warranted.

In RF- or ACPA-positive patients who have not achieved low disease activity or remission after a total of six months of DMARD monotherapy, we switch to triple therapy; and in patients who do not achieve low disease activity or remission within three to six months on triple therapy, we switch to MTX plus any of the biologics that have proven effective in RA (usually a TNF inhibitor).

The initial therapeutic goal is to achieve significant clinical improvement within three months, which may be defined as at least a moderate (50 percent) reduction in disease activity using a composite measure. (See <a href=\"#H91063007\" class=\"local\">'Treatment approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H91064080\" class=\"local\">'Initial DMARD therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20394522\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic target'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20249349\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for DMARDs in UA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with UA with upper-extremity involvement or who have a positive test for RF or ACPA, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) rather than other DMARDs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The dose should be gradually titrated up to 20 to 25 mg once weekly to achieve a clinical response.

In patients who have not responded adequately to initial DMARD therapy, we prefer sequential DMARD monotherapy or combination therapy with MTX, SSZ, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ) rather than initiating treatment with a biologic DMARD (bDMARD).

(See <a href=\"#H156627050\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive role of antiinflammatory agents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20249940\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy for flares'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approaches to preventive and nonpharmacologic therapy, pretreatment evaluation, and monitoring of disease activity and for drug toxicity follow the same strategies as for patients with RA.
