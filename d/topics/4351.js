The proportion of participants with high-risk hsCRP levels rose from 41.2 percent at baseline to 46.3 percent at 36 months. These findings, coupled with the high rates of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in youth with T2DM, underscore the need for monitoring and treatment to reduce future risk for macrovascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hypertension'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Dyslipidemia'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H371142\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Youth with T2DM appear to have an increased risk for depression and binge eating compared with nondiabetic youth. In the baseline data from a multicenter study, 26 percent of participants with available data (n=678) endorsed clinical or subclinical symptoms of binge eating on a standardized eating disorder questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In addition, 15 percent out of 689 participants reported clinically significant depressive symptoms. In follow up of the same cohort, stressful life events predicted impaired psychosocial functioning and lower adherence to prescribed medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Because both binge eating and depression interfere with weight loss efforts in youth with obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], identifying and treating these issues may be an important step in management of T2DM. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H729745936\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER COMPLICATIONS/COMORBIDITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Youth with T2DM are at risk for a number of other problems, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the comorbidities associated with pediatric obesity such as obstructive sleep apnea and orthopedic complications. The clinician should be vigilant for suggestive symptoms and signs of each of these disorders, and evaluate more specifically as needed.

Both T2DM and hypertension increase the risk for vascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend that blood pressure (BP) be measured at all routine health care visits for pediatric patients with T2DM (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In adolescents 13 years and older, elevated BP (prehypertension) is defined as systolic BP 120 to 129 mmHg, with diastolic BP &lt;80 mmHg. Hypertension is defined as systolic or diastolic BP <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;130/80,</span> measured on three or more separate occasions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114574 \">table 1</a>). For children &lt;13 years, hypertension is defined as systolic or diastolic BP &ge;95th percentile, or <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;130/80</span> mmHg (whichever is lower). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If elevated BP is present, we recommend that nonpharmacologic therapy (diet, salt restriction, exercise, and weight reduction) is used initially (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). If the elevated BP is not responsive to these measures, pharmacologic therapy should be initiated. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If hypertension is diagnosed in a patient with diabetes, we recommend initiating pharmacologic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The preferred antihypertensive agent is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) if the ACE inhibitor is not tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonemergent-treatment-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonemergent treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dyslipidemia</strong> &ndash; Patients with T2DM are at increased risk for dyslipidemia, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In our practice, we use the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines for screening and treatment of dyslipidemia in pediatric patients with T2DM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90954\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90954 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Dyslipidemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In all pediatric patients with T2DM, we suggest that lipid profiles are obtained at diagnosis (after blood glucose control has been well established), and repeated every two years if the prior screen is normal (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that nonpharmacologic therapy (diet, exercise, improved glycemic control, and weight reduction) is initially used to manage dyslipidemia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest that pharmacologic therapy is reserved for children over 10 years of age, who fail nonpharmacologic therapy, and have elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (&ge;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&ge;3.36 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> ) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Our preferred pharmacologic agent is a statin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</strong> &ndash; Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common among children with T2DM, and is usually the cause of elevated aminotransferase levels. The only established treatment is weight reduction. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metformin</a> and other anti-hyperglycemia drugs used for treatment of T2DM, also may cause aminotransferase elevations, but it is reasonable to proceed with metformin therapy as long as serum aminotransferase levels are closely monitored and generally &le;2.5 times the upper limit of normal. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperglycemia</strong> &ndash; Both diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemia can occur in patients with T2DM. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hyperglycemia and DKA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microvascular complications &ndash; </strong>In both adults and children, the risk of microvascular complications increases with poor glycemic control and duration of T2DM. Early detection allows for intervention that may reverse vascular disease or delay further progression. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Vascular complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Retinopathy</strong> &ndash; For pediatric patients with T2DM, we recommend annual ophthalmologic evaluation to screen for diabetic retinopathy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Retinopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Nephropathy</strong> &ndash; We recommend annual screening for albuminuria, by measuring the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Nephropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Neuropathy</strong> &ndash; We suggest annual screening for diabetic neuropathy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Annual screening typically is performed with a careful examination of the sensory nerves. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-and-complications-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Pinhas-Hamiel O, Zeitler P.
