In children younger than two to three years of age, visual behavior (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73947 \">table 3</a>), rather than visual acuity, is assessed.

Children with a history of severe prematurity, for example, are at higher risk for developing amblyopia, high myopia (nearsightedness), and strabismus. Among children with severe visual impairment, 70 percent have additional handicaps; 10 percent have impaired hearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The family history should be reviewed for serious childhood eye disease (eg, childhood cataracts, strabismus, amblyopia, glaucoma, retinal problems, nystagmus). Many ophthalmologic conditions are familial; a positive family history increases the likelihood the child may have similar problems.

The goal is to determine whether visual behavior is normal for age and whether behavior is similar between the two eyes. Visual behavior can be tested in virtually all children. Newborn infants demonstrate visual fixation if an appropriate target (eg, the human face) is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment of visual behavior begins with the observation of the child's reaction as the examiner enters the room.

The choice of target varies depending upon the age of the child. Objects with spatial orientation are essential:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The human face, for which there may be a genetic fixation preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], is the ideal target for children younger than three to four months of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small, colorful toys or stickers placed on the end of tongue depressors are good targets for infants older than three to four months. More than one target may be necessary for these children because they rapidly lose interest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White light (eg, from a pen light) should be avoided because it lacks spatial orientation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targets that make noise should be avoided because they provide both visual and auditory cues, and distinguishing which cues the child is using to track the object is difficult.</p><p/><p>In testing fixation, the target is moved to and fro while the child remains still. False-positive results may be obtained if the child, rather than the target, is moved. Movement of the child may activate the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which causes the eyes to move; this reflex is not a measure of visual behavior. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Vestibulo-ocular reflex'</a> below.)</p><p>Both eyes are assessed together, and then each eye is tested separately by occluding one eye at a time. Accuracy is improved if the fixation test is repeated several times. The eye movements of infants are expected to be somewhat uncoordinated. The ability to follow past midline develops at approximately three to six months of age; vertical eye movements develop around three months.</p><p>Serious visual disorders may be indicated by asymmetry or abnormality in the fixation reflex. One limitation of the fixation-and-follow test is that it uses the presence of a motor function (eye movement) as a marker of vision. Thus, false-negative results may be obtained if the child has a condition that prevents normal eye movement.

Each eye is tested separately. Notation also should be made of the child's ability to maintain fixation with the viewing eye when the other eye is uncovered. Special techniques available to the ophthalmologist may be required to determine if an eye is able to maintain fixation after the other eye is uncovered. In children with strabismus, however, movements to re-fixate the eye can be appreciated without these special techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-strabismus-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of strabismus in children&quot;, section on 'Cover/uncover test'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Preferential looking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The forced preferential looking method uses grating (Teller) cards to test visual acuity and relies upon the preference of children to look at patterns of alternating contrast rather than homogeneous targets. Grating cards typically have one target area with alternating light and dark stripes and another that is homogeneously gray. The examiner, observing through a small hole in the center of the card, notes the direction of the child's gaze as each card is presented. Targets with thinner and thinner stripes are presented until the child no longer has a preference. Visual acuity is estimated by the thinnest target lines that the child is able to detect. Accuracy is improved with test repetition. This technique has several limitations (ie, it is time consuming, it tends to overestimate vision, accuracy depends on the examiner's skill level) and it is used infrequently in the primary care setting, though it may sometimes be used by the ophthalmologist or optometrist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Children 3 years and older</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate assessment of visual acuity can be made in almost all cooperative verbal children.

The Snellen acuity test (the standard letter test) is the preferred test for cooperative children who can identify all the letters of the alphabet. The HOTV and LEA tests are preferred tests for preverbal children and those who cannot readily identify letters. Selection of age-appropriate optotypes is key in accurate determination of visual acuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Letter charts</strong> &ndash; The Snellen acuity test (the standard letter test) is the gold-standard test and is typically used for children who can identify the letters of the alphabet.

These tests are not recommended for preschool children who may have difficulty comprehending right versus left and coordinating, pointing, or communicating the correct direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8,9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Matching tests</strong> &ndash; Matching tests can be performed with letter or shape optotypes (eg, HOTV and LEA charts) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60600 \">figure 2</a>) to test the visual acuity of children who are unwilling or unable to communicate verbally. Matching tests are particularly useful for children who are shy or who have a speech impairment. The examiner indicates an optotype on the vision chart, and the child points to the optotype that matches it on his or her own sample card of the optotypes.

Thus, using a row of figures or letters rather than a single optotype provides a more accurate assessment of visual acuity and improves detection of amblyopia.</p><p>For children who find it easier to understand the vision testing process when single optotypes are presented, crowding bars can be placed around the optotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60600 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vision testing performance can be improved by preteaching children how to do the test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Teaching typically is performed by holding the test targets close to the child or using large optotypes; both of the child's eyes should be used during practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Parents can practice with the child at home before the vision evaluation if they are provided with a copy of the test optotypes and instructions for practicing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110884\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110884 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Optotype recognition tests are designed to test the vision in each eye individually. For children who wear glasses, vision should be assessed with and without glasses. If the child is known to have poor vision in one eye, that eye should be tested first to minimize poor performance from loss of attention and to avoid memorization artifact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Testing artifacts'</a> below.)</p><p>In the United States, testing at a distance of 10 feet is recommended and should be performed with an eye chart that is calibrated for this distance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In other countries, the distance may be 4 or 6 meters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88620\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88620 \">table 5</a>). In the primary care setting, testing at 10 feet is preferred over 20 feet because often the only 20-foot distance may be in an active, noisy hallway full of distractions. In addition, many children perform better with the test target at 10 feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/16,18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,20</a>]. A Snellen chart specifically designed for use at 10 feet must be used for accurate testing at this distance.</p><p>Visual acuity testing should be performed efficiently, since the child may quickly lose interest; the child need not identify every optotype on the chart. If the child appears to see normally, the examiner should begin with the &quot;critical line&quot; (ie, the line a child is expected to see normally and pass) and adjust up or down as needed. The &quot;critical line&quot; varies with age (36 through 47 months: <span class=\"nowrap\">20/50;</span> 48 through 59 months: <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40;</span> &ge;60 months: <span class=\"nowrap\">20/30)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>If the child misses two figures in a line, the examiner should ask the child to identify all of the figures in the previous line. Visual acuity for the tested eye is the visual acuity of the line above the line in which the child consistently misses two or more figures.</p><p>The visual acuity often can be determined using only two or three lines of optotypes.</p><p>It may be easier to keep the child on task if the examiner performs the testing in a game-like manner. Encouragement and positive reinforcement from the parents and the examiner are critical, particularly for the shy child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The child must identify the majority of optotypes of a visual acuity line correctly to be scored with that acuity. When unequal visual acuity is detected, the eye with worse acuity should be retested.</p><p>Measured visual acuity varies with the age of the child. The &quot;rule of 8s&quot; is a helpful mnemonic for determining the need for referral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111363\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111363 \">table 4</a>). The patient's age plus the tens digit of the denominator of his or her visual acuity should be &le;8. Referral is generally warranted if the sum is &gt;8. For example, a five-year-old with visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/<strong>3</strong>0</span> (5+<strong>3</strong> = 8) does <strong>not</strong> need to be referred; however, a five-year-old with visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/<strong>5</strong>0</span> (5+<strong>5</strong> = 10) should be referred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Many children actually have better visual acuity than is recorded, but they are not able to maintain attention for the testing of very small letters. The author of this topic review often tells parents that their child probably has <span class=\"nowrap\">20/20</span> vision, but only a <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> attention span, for example.</p><p>Amblyopia should be suspected if acuity differs by two or more rows between eyes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amblyopia-in-children-classification-screening-and-evaluation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amblyopia in children: Classification, screening, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Testing artifacts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children may squint, peek, or memorize the chart in an effort to do a good job, any of which may falsely improve the recorded visual acuity. In addition, in children with amblyopia, visual acuity may falsely appear to improve if optotypes are presented in isolation rather than in a row (the crowding phenomenon, described above). The recorded visual acuity may be falsely low in children who have nystagmus unless efforts are made to compensate for it using techniques that typically are available only to the ophthalmologist. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Vision assessment in children with nystagmus'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squinting &ndash; Squinting creates a &quot;pinhole&quot; effect, limiting the number of light rays that enter the eye, and thereby minimizes the blur that is present without squinting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peeking &ndash; Peeking can be eliminated by using a patch for occlusion of one eye (or, if a patch is not available, the examiner can ask the parent to place his or her hand over the child's eye). Peeking occurs frequently and can be overlooked if the examiner is not paying close attention to the child. The child can peek around a handheld occluder if the examiner turns around to verify the optotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memorization &ndash; Memorization of a row of optotypes is difficult to prevent but is easily overcome by asking the child to read the optotypes in reverse or random order. Computer-generated eye charts provide an unlimited array of letter combinations that can be used to prevent memorization. These systems also facilitate vision testing using a strict protocol that may improve accuracy. However, their cost typically precludes their use in the primary care setting.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3092026\"><span class=\"h1\">INSTRUMENT-BASED SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instrument-based vision screening devices (eg, photoscreening and autorefraction) can identify ocular risk factors that lead to vision loss in children, though they do not directly assess visual acuity. These methods are endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the United States Preventive Task Force for screening in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23,24</a>].</p><p>Photoscreening devices use optical images of the red reflex to detect refractive errors (anisometropia, high hypermetropia, high astigmatism), media opacities (eg, cataracts), strabismus, or adnexal deformities (eg, ptosis), each of which is a risk factor for amblyopia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Autorefractors use automated retinoscopy or wave-front technology to evaluate refractive error and are therefore limited in their ability to detect strabismus in the absence of refractive error.</p><p>Instrument-based screening is relatively quick and requires minimal cooperation of the child. These methods are particularly useful in preverbal, preliterate, or developmentally delayed children. If available, instrument-based screening can be performed beginning at age 12 months. Once children can read an eye chart easily, optotype-based testing should be used instead of instrument-based testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Optotype tests'</a> above.)</p><p>In observational studies, vision screening of preschool children with photoscreening or autorefraction has been associated with early detection of risk factors for amblyopia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/26-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-37</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Vision assessment in children with nystagmus'</a> below.)</p><p>Near vision testing is performed much the same as is that for distance vision. A near vision testing card is used to present optotypes that are appropriately sized for the testing distance that is printed on the card, typically 14 inches. Near vision is tested with each eye individually. The distance at which the test is performed must be recorded because the testing distance alters the size of the image projected on the retina and, hence, the test results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">COLOR VISION TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper color discrimination requires normal cone function. Most color vision abnormalities in children are congenital. Acquired color vision deficits are much less common and can be caused by optic nerve or retinal disease, among others.</p><p>Opinion varies on the value of routine color vision testing in otherwise asymptomatic children. We generally reserve color vision testing for children who have an indication such as a family history of color vision deficits, problems with color discrimination, or a condition (eg, optic neuritis, Turner syndrome) or medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ethambutol</a>) associated with color vision abnormality. Some eye specialists routinely test color vision on new patients who are old enough to cooperate for testing (usually around four to six years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]). </p><p>The prevalence of color vision deficiency varies according to sex and <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity</span>. In a population-based cross-sectional study (the Multi-Ethnic Pediatric Eye Disease Study), the prevalence of color vision deficiency was 1.6 percent among 4005 children (37 to 72 months of age) who were able to complete color vision testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Color vision deficiency was increased in boys (3 versus 0.02 percent). Among boys, color vision deficiency was most common in non-Hispanic whites (5.6 percent), followed by Asians (3.1 percent), and less common among Hispanics (2.6 percent) and blacks (1.4 percent). </p><p>Color vision testing can be achieved with a variety of tests. Pseudo-isochromatic plates, such as those available with the Ishihara and the Hardy-Rand-Rittler tests, are commonly used color vision screening tests. More advanced tests, such as the Farnsworth D-15 and Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue tests, may be used to better characterize a deficit noted on screening tests.</p><p>Additional information about color blindness is available through the <a href=\"http://www.aapos.org/terms/conditions/144&amp;token=TCZoDJKkgSsgDea9026wfMpx993h0a0dNiZ9+5Ud90W1BeTA2+Kv9gQV7GYgrdKUNSKwKmKZ9UYh6yNF0iIIBA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6895\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus</a> and <a href=\"http://www.colourblindawareness.org/&amp;token=dTWXrNv+StOeNp8kvk4ODI+qUZkxipN4Mtqzk5D+3XczXtZPpOKv9FG8KCTfN/me&amp;TOPIC_ID=6895\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Colour Blind Awareness</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">VISION ASSESSMENT IN CHILDREN WITH NYSTAGMUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nystagmus, a rhythmic to-and-fro movement of the eyes, can be horizontal, vertical, rotary, or a combination of these. Nystagmus may be present all the time (manifest) or only when one eye is covered (latent). Children in whom nystagmus is detected should be referred for ophthalmologic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nystagmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nystagmus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vision is usually decreased in children with nystagmus. However, near vision may be better than distance vision.

Many children with manifest nystagmus can improve their vision by assuming an abnormal head posture. Nystagmus may be damped when the eyes are directed in a particular field of gaze (eg, up gaze, side gaze, etc), prompting the abnormal head posture. This quiet eye position is called the null zone.</p><p>Children with manifest nystagmus should have visual acuity tested initially with both eyes open and the head erect, then with both eyes open and the head in the preferred posture. As an example, the results of testing for a child who holds the head to the left would be documented as follows:</p><p>Vision tested with both eyes open:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With head straight &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">20/80</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With head turned to left &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">20/25</span></p><p/><p>Vision then is tested in each eye separately, and the head posture the patient adopts should be noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Latent nystagmus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Latent nystagmus is present only when one eye is covered. Children who have latent nystagmus should be tested initially with both eyes open; in this situation, the eyes are quiet and motionless. Abnormal head posture should be noted if present. Vision should then be tested in each eye individually. In the pediatric ophthalmology office, the eye that is not being tested is covered with a +5.00 to +10.00 lens to &quot;fog&quot;, but not occlude, the vision. Monocular visual acuity can be more accurately assessed because fogging does not induce latent nystagmus.

This goal is often best met with involvement of the child's parents, teachers, primary care physician, neurologist, ophthalmologist, counselor, physical or occupational therapist, and others who can provide information about the child's visual performance.</p><p>The examiner should have an understanding of the effects of the child's medical problems on the child's behavior so that testing conditions can be optimized. Some children perform better at certain times of day (eg, in the morning or when most awake); others are on medications that may affect their ability to perform. Visual assessment is feasible in the majority of children with special healthcare needs under the right circumstances (eg, suitably adapted methods, familiar environment, patient and skilled examiner) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a cohort of 240 children attending schools for special needs, 95 percent were able to cooperate with assessment of visual function, and visual acuity could be reliably assessed in 83 percent. Approximately one-half had a refractive error that required correction, and one-half of these required a new prescription.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important clinical signs of severe visual impairment include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manifest nystagmus (present all the time), which may result from abnormalities of the eyes, optic nerves, or brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Blindisms&quot; or behaviors that occur in children with severe visual impairment. Examples include repeated poking of the eyes (oculodigital reflex), repetitive rocking of the head or trunk, and repetitive hand waving.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Vision tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some rudimentary tests of vision can be used to assess the visual performance of children with special needs who cannot perform conventional optotype testing and in whom visual behavior is otherwise difficult to assess:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal response to a bright pen light is eye closure or withdrawal; ignoring the light is a cause for concern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constriction of the pupils to light indicates that the afferent and efferent pupillomotor pathways are intact and increases the likelihood that the child sees. However, the test must be interpreted with caution, because children with cortical blindness may have normal pupillary responses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The threat response is a learned reflex in which the child withdraws when an object (or the examiner's hand) is moved rapidly into the child's visual space. It indicates the presence of at least rudimentary vision and is reliable in children older than six months of age.</p><p/><p>Other means of testing the vision of children with special needs include the vestibulo-ocular reflex and use of optokinetic drums.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Vestibulo-ocular reflex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is a normal reflex in people who have an intact neurologic system. The examiner, while holding the child, rotates 360 degrees to stimulate the semicircular canals in the inner ear and cause a temporary nystagmus. The presence of normal vision inhibits VOR nystagmus within three to five seconds after the rotation stops. Nystagmus may continue for 15 to 30 seconds in children who have severe visual impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Optokinetic drum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optokinetic drums are cylindrical devices with a recurring pattern of white and black stripes of varying thickness. Rotation of the drum in the child's visual space stimulates the development of nystagmus if the child can distinguish the black and white contrast. Gross vision (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">20/400)</span> is present if the child responds to the optokinetic drum with thick stripes. Visual acuity can be estimated by using drums with thinner and thinner stripes until the response is no longer detected. False negative tests occur in children who lack interest or who do not have normal ocular motor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. False-positive results, presumably caused by the presence of other vision-related neural pathways, can occur in children who do not have a normal visual cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">VISUAL EVOKED POTENTIAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The office eye examination is not always sufficient to determine whether a child is able to see. The visual evoked potential (VEP) test is used when other measures do not provide the necessary information. The VEP test uses electrodes that are placed on the child's scalp, over the occipital lobes of the brain, to detect electrical response in the visual cortex in response to visual stimuli.</p><p>VEP testing is not necessary in routine clinical practice and is generally obtained only in special situations, such as when office visual function testing fails to demonstrate visual function but the other clinical findings suggest the child can see, or if the clinician feels the child does not have vision but the family feels that the child can see. VEP testing may provide an answer in these situations. In addition, VEP testing is sometimes used to assess the potential for vision in a child prior to undergoing complex eye surgery to restore vision. </p><p>The visual stimuli are patterned targets (eg, checkerboards) that are presented to the child on a television monitor. Analysis of the electrical patterns that are produced permits estimation of the child's visual acuity. Close agreement between VEP testing and psychophysical testing exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, VEP results must be interpreted with caution because variation in laboratory technique can alter the results, and normal flash VEP (VEP using a flash stimulus rather than a patterned target) can occur in the absence of a functioning visual cortex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

It is important to ask the parents specific questions about the child's vision, including whether the child sees well, holds things close, or squints; the eyes appear to cross or wander; the eyelids droop; or the eyes have ever been injured. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Visual history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children younger than two to three years of age, visual behavior (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73947 \">table 3</a>), rather than visual acuity, is assessed. The goal is to determine whether visual behavior is normal for age and whether vision behavior is similar between the two eyes. Visual behavior may be assessed through observation, evaluation of the fixation reflex, and forced preferential looking. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Infants and children &lt;3 years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual acuity testing with optotypes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60600 \">figure 2</a>) should be attempted in all children three years and older. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Children 3 years and older'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Instrument-based screening (eg, photoscreening and autorefraction), if available, can be performed beginning at age 12 months to identify ocular risk factors that may lead to vision loss. Instrument-based screening is relatively quick and requires minimal cooperation of the child. Once children can read an eye chart easily, optotype-based testing should be used instead of instrument-based testing. (See <a href=\"#H3092026\" class=\"local\">'Instrument-based screening'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hyvarinen L.
