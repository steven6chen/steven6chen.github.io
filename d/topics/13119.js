At the histologic level, neoplasms of the pancreas can resemble normal ductal cells, acinar cells, or islet cells. In addition, some pancreatic neoplasms appear to arise from primitive cells that have the potential to differentiate along several lines, giving rise to complex tumors with mixed cell types (eg, pancreatoblastoma).</p><p>Pancreatic cancer ranks fourth among cancers as a cause of death (both sexes) in the United States, surpassed only by lung, colon, and breast cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The commonly used terms &quot;carcinoma of the pancreas&quot; or &quot;pancreatic cancer&quot; usually refer to ductal adenocarcinoma (including its subtypes), which represents approximately 85 percent of all pancreatic neoplasms. Of the several subtypes of ductal adenocarcinoma, most share a similar poor long-term prognosis, with the exception of colloid carcinomas, which have a somewhat better prognosis.</p><p>The more inclusive term &quot;exocrine pancreatic neoplasms&quot; includes all tumors that are related to the pancreatic ductal and acinar cells and their stem cells (including pancreatoblastoma). More than 95 percent of malignant neoplasms of the pancreas arise from the exocrine elements. Neoplasms arising from the endocrine pancreas (ie, islet cell tumors) comprise no more than 5 percent of pancreatic neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Although the incidence of pancreatic cancer has been relatively stable over time, the increasing use of imaging techniques such as endoscopic ultrasound and helical (spiral) abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans has revealed an increasing number of incidentally found cystic lesions in the pancreas, many of which are neoplasms. This has focused attention on the diagnosis and management of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas.</p><p>Of the cystic neoplasms that arise in the pancreas, some (eg, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms [IPMN]) have a significant malignant potential (30 to 40 percent in reported series) while others (eg, serous cystadenomas) almost always remain benign. The distinction on clinical grounds between these two types of neoplasms, other cystic neoplasms, and other nonneoplastic cystic pancreatic masses (pseudocysts and developmental cysts) can be difficult. The exclusion of malignancy in a cystic pancreatic lesion often requires surgical resection and histopathological evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-pancreatic-cysts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of pancreatic cysts&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas (IPMN): Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The size range of pancreatic neoplasms is broad. Neoplasms begin as microscopic foci (mm in diameter), and the lower size limit for detection is in the range of 2 to 5 mm using the most sensitive imaging techniques (endoscopic ultrasound). However, advanced exocrine neoplasms can range up to 36 cm for large cystic neoplasms. The mean size for resected pancreatic carcinomas is usually in the range of 3 to 5 cm.</p><p>In general, carcinomas (ductal as well as other types) arising in the head of the pancreas tend to be diagnosed earlier when they are smaller and less advanced than do tumors in the body and tail because even small neoplasms near the common bile duct or ampulla of Vater can cause biliary obstruction and painless jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Related topics, such as risk factors and the molecular pathology of exocrine pancreatic cancer, are discussed elsewhere, as are the various types of islet cell tumors that arise in the endocrine pancreas.

These classifications, which were developed beginning in the 1990s, are based upon morphologic and histologic features.</p><p>The following discussion predominantly uses WHO nomenclature, which is now similar to the most recent AFIP classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An example of a difference in terminology from earlier versions of both classifications is the nomenclature for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN). Both the AFIP and WHO classifications recommend use of the term MCN or IPMN in conjunction with a description of the histologic grade (low-grade dysplasia, intermediate-grade [moderate] dysplasia, or high-grade dysplasia). These three grades correspond to the former classification of these lesions as benign, borderline, and noninvasive carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign neoplasms such as serous cystadenoma are reliably cured by surgical removal alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Premalignant lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neoplasms discussed below include some with the potential to progress to malignancy and some that were formerly referred to as tumors of uncertain malignant potential (also called &quot;borderline&quot; tumors). Patients with these neoplasms are considered to be at risk for progression to invasive malignancy.</p><p>A recent trend in the histopathology of premalignant lesions in the pancreas is to designate the degree of dysplasia as &quot;low-grade&quot; or &quot;high-grade&quot; (rather than as three grades such as <span class=\"nowrap\">mild/moderate/severe</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">low/intermediate/high-grade)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. When the two-grade convention is used, the low-grade lesions include those formerly classed as showing low- or intermediate-grade dysplasia, whereas high-grade lesions are those classed as showing severe dysplasia. Three-tiered grading systems are used in older literature and may still be in use in some centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of types of malignant tumors arise in the exocrine pancreas; in the following list of the main histologic types and subtypes, the percentages indicate the approximate prevalence of that subtype:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ductal adenocarcinoma &ndash; approximately 85 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Signet ring cell carcinoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adenosquamous carcinoma (which accounts for 4 percent of all pancreatic malignancies)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Undifferentiated (anaplastic) carcinoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mucinous noncystic (colloid) carcinoma (2 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with an associated invasive carcinoma &ndash; 2 to 3 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucinous cystic neoplasms with an associated invasive carcinoma &ndash; 1 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm &ndash; &lt;1 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acinar cell carcinoma &ndash; &lt;1 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreatoblastoma &ndash; &lt;1 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serous cystadenocarcinoma &ndash; &lt;1 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PANCREATIC DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, ductal adenocarcinomas represent the most common type of pancreatic exocrine neoplasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate histopathologic diagnosis requires biopsy or surgical resection of the neoplasm. The need for biopsy arises because of the wide variety of neoplasms that occur in the pancreas, and because some forms of pancreatitis (including autoimmune pancreatitis and paraduodenal pancreatitis [groove pancreatitis]) form masses that may be mistaken for carcinoma on imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diagnostic biopsy of a suspected pancreatic malignancy is indicated for treatment planning if there is systemic spread of disease, local evidence of unresectability, or if the patient is unfit for surgery. In such cases, the diagnosis can often be accomplished by cytologic examination of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) or core needle biopsy.</p><p>However, whether a preoperative diagnostic biopsy is needed in a patient with a potentially resectable pancreatic lesion suspected of malignancy is controversial if he or she is otherwise a candidate for resection. While a positive biopsy can confirm the suspected diagnosis, a benign sample does not exclude the presence of malignancy. This issue is addressed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H2363341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic algorithm and need for preoperative biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Gross pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of ductal adenocarcinomas are gritty, hard, gray-white masses that are poorly circumscribed due to invasion of the adjacent pancreas or nearby tissues. These tumors most commonly arise in the head of the pancreas (the ratio of head to <span class=\"nowrap\">body/tail</span> lesions is 3:1).</p><p>The designation as &quot;ductal&quot; is based upon histologic features, and does not necessarily imply origin in the main pancreatic duct or major branch ducts. In fact, many ductal adenocarcinomas appear to arise more peripherally in small ducts within the acinar tissue.</p><p>As they grow, pancreatic ductal neoplasms can cause obstruction of the pancreatic duct, leading to chronic pancreatitis in the obstructed segment of the pancreas. However, because the accessory duct of Santorini can allow bypass of the main pancreatic duct, steatorrhea and malabsorption are usually not clinical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology and grading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas are moderately to poorly differentiated, with varying degrees of duct-like structures and mucin production (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56909\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56909 \">picture 1</a>). Histologic grading, which is based upon the degree of differentiation and the prevalence of mitotic cells, typically uses three grade levels (grade 1, well differentiated; grade 2, moderately differentiated; grade 3, poorly differentiated), although highly anaplastic tumors are sometimes designated grade 4.</p><p>Dense stromal fibrosis is characteristic of ductal adenocarcinomas, and is the reason that they are referred to as &quot;scirrhous&quot; or &quot;desmoplastic&quot; carcinomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56909\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56909 \">picture 1</a>). The stromal fibrosis is attributed, in part, to alterations in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of local spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local extension typically involves adjacent structures such as the duodenum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55383\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55383 \">picture 2</a>), the portal vein, or superior mesenteric vessels. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas also show a striking tendency for perineural invasion both within and beyond the pancreas (eg, the retroperitoneum) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60817 \">picture 3</a>). There is some evidence to support paracrine regulation of pancreatic cancer invasion by peripheral nerves, which may explain this general observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The difficulty in achieving a wide resection margin due to the proximity to the aorta, the superior mesenteric artery, and the portal vein accounts for the fact that the retroperitoneal tissue behind the head of the pancreas represents the most common site of disease recurrence after resection.</p><p>Occasionally there may be local extension to the spleen, adrenal glands, vertebral column, transverse colon, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stomach. In most cases, tumors with this degree of local invasion are not resectable for cure.</p><p>Regional peripancreatic lymph nodes frequently harbor metastatic deposits. More distant lymph node groups that are less often involved include the perigastric, mesenteric, omental, and portahepatic nodes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer#H1472388\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of exocrine pancreatic cancer&quot;, section on 'Definitions of unresectable and borderline resectable disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An individual patient's prognosis depends to some extent upon the histologic grade of the tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62123\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62123 \">table 1</a>), but more importantly on the extent of spread (tumor, node, metastasis [TNM] stage) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111135\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111135 \">table 2</a>). However, even in the setting of completely resected, node-negative pancreatic cancer, the majority of patients with ductal adenocarcinoma still die of their disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113536\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113536 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For patients with unresected pancreatic adenocarcinoma, prognosis is uniformly dismal, regardless of stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59441 \">table 3</a>).

The epithelium is often columnar and contains increased cytoplasmic mucin. PanIN can occur in the main pancreatic duct and its major branches, but the majority appear to arise in smaller intralobular ducts.</p><p>PanIN exhibits varying degrees of dysplasia, which were originally graded as mild, moderate, or severe (designated as PanIN-1, PanIN-2, and PanIN-3, respectively) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63457\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63457 \">picture 4</a>). Higher-grade PanIN is often papillary in microscopic appearance. This nomenclature has replaced diverse earlier descriptive terms such as mucinous hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia, and carcinoma in situ (now called PanIN-3). Use of a two-tier grading system (low-grade, high-grade) for PanIN, as discussed above for other premalignant lesions in the pancreas, has been recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Within this system, PanIN-1 and PanIN-2 are grouped together as low-grade PanIN. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Premalignant lesions'</a> above.)</p><p>Some (but not all) PanIN are considered to progress from low-grade to high-grade dysplasia, and then to ductal adenocarcinoma. Most ductal adenocarcinomas are considered to arise from PanIN, presumably developing as a result of a series of genetic events. However, although PanIN is considered to represent a precursor lesion to invasive ductal adenocarcinoma, it appears that only a small fraction of low-grade PanIN progress to invasive cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The role of PanIN as a precursor lesion for other types of pancreatic neoplasms is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The incidence and number of PanIN rise with age, and low-grade PanIN are very common in patients older than age 50 (&gt;50 percent prevalence). Noninvasive precursor lesions such as PanIN are more common and of a higher grade in patients with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-risk-factors-for-pancreatic-cancer-and-screening-of-high-risk-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial risk factors for pancreatic cancer and screening of high-risk patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Little is known about the significance of incidentally discovered PanIN, although case reports suggest a possible association with metachronous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. This issue was addressed in a series of 584 patients undergoing pancreatectomy for a reason other than a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma at a single institution over a 10-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. PanIN was identified in 153 (26 percent); only 13 (8 percent) had PanIN-3. The presence of PanIN of any grade was not associated with an appreciable cancer risk in the pancreatic remnant, at least with short-term follow-up (median 3.7 years, range 0.5-12.6). More studies with long-term follow-up are needed before definite conclusions can be made. However, at present, there are no data to support routine surveillance of patients who are found to have low-grade PanIN after undergoing resection for a benign pancreatic lesion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER NEOPLASMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other pancreatic neoplasms merit comment because of their special characteristics. Many of these are cystic neoplasms that must be distinguished from one another and also from other nonneoplastic cystic pancreatic masses such as pseudocysts and developmental cysts. Cystic neoplasms comprise approximately five percent of exocrine pancreatic neoplasms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-pancreatic-cysts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of pancreatic cysts&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasms (IPMN)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IPMN are cystic neoplasms that are clearly derived from the pancreatic ducts. They occur in older adults (mean age approximately 65 years) of both sexes.</p><p>IPMN arise in both the main duct and branch ducts. In both locations the cystic lesions are usually lined by columnar mucin-secreting epithelium overlying a fibrous wall of variable thickness. They may be multifocal and sometimes involve the entire main duct. IPMNs may be found throughout the pancreas but are more frequent in the head of the gland.</p><p>The characteristic features include diffuse or segmental dilation of the pancreatic duct, intraductal expansion of mucin-producing ductal cells, and dilation of either the ampulla or minor papillae, through which there may be copious secretion of mucus into the duodenum. The diagnosis is often suspected when thick mucus is seen extruding from the papilla of Vater at the time of endoscopy in a patient with cystic ductal changes in the pancreas.</p><p>The mucin content of IPMNs is frequently highly viscous and therefore likely to be retained in the duct system, causing dilation. Patients with IPMN can present with repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis, presumably triggered by intermittent duct obstruction caused by mucus plugs.</p><p>IPMN are sometimes designated as main duct type (MDT-IPMN), branch duct type (BDT-IPMN), or combined type, based upon the anatomic involvement of the pancreatic ducts.

BDT-IPMN may have a lower risk of malignant transformation compared with MDT lesions, and many can be observed rather than resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>It is likely that the malignant potential is determined more by the histologic subtype than by location per se (see below).</p><p>A number of other names (eg, mucinous duct ectasia) were applied in the older literature, especially preceding publication of the 1996 World Health Organization (WHO) classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], in which the group was designated as intraductal papillary-mucinous tumors (IPMT). This terminology was revised to IPMN in the more recent classifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Mucinous cystic neoplasms (see below) have sometimes been confused with IPMN, so some early reports appear to include both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Histology and grading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IPMN are graded according to the degree of cellular dysplasia and the growth pattern (architecture) of the lining epithelium.

Overall, 30 to 35 percent of IPMN have been associated with invasion, but a more recent report suggests that this rate is based on larger, resected IPMN, and that the true rate is lower when smaller IPMN are included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

These histologic subtypes are distinguished on the basis of differences in cytologic appearance, architecture, and mucin expression of the epithelial cells of the lesion. The subtypes are usually designated as intestinal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55059\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55059 \">picture 5</a>), gastric foveolar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72592\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72592 \">picture 6</a>), pancreatobiliary, oncocytic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53658\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53658 \">picture 7</a>), and tubular types. The latter two types are included in the group of IPMN because they are intraductal, although oncocytic IPMN contain less mucin, and tubular IPMN are more solid than papillary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The intestinal type is reported as the most common in some series that are based upon resected IPMN, but the gastric type is felt to be more common overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Gastric-type IPMN typically show no more than low-grade dysplasia. Intestinal-type IPMN more often show higher grade dysplasia. The less common pancreatobiliary-type IPMN typically show high-grade dysplasia and are considered to have high malignant potential. Oncocytic type IPMN typically exhibit high-grade dysplasia. Tubular type IPMN are rare and are usually low grade.</p><p>The intestinal type occurs more frequently in the main duct than in branch ducts, while the other common subtype, the gastric type, characteristically occurs in the branch ducts. It is uncertain whether one type may transform to another, but more than one histologic type may be found in a single neoplasm, most often both gastric foveolar and intestinal.</p><p>When there is more than minimal local invasion (sometimes designated as microinvasion), the prognosis is determined by the invasive component and the designation is IPMN associated with invasion. In approximately one-half of invasive IPMN, the invasive component is a ductal adenocarcinoma. In the remainder, the invasive component is a noncystic mucinous (colloid) carcinoma in which interstitial mucin pools contain mucin-secreting malignant cells, and some small mucin-filled cysts are partially lined by the malignant epithelium. This invasive pattern is most often associated with intestinal type IPMN (designated a colloid carcinoma associated with intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma, intestinal type) although intestinal-type IPMN can also progress to typical solid ductal adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The distinction between colloid and solid ductal patterns of invasion has clinical significance because the prognosis of patients with colloid carcinomas (when this pattern is clearly dominant) is better than for patients with invasive ductal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The nomenclature for IPMN is complex and still evolving. There is likely to be variation in terminology in different institutions, and terminology will likely evolve over time. If the histopathologic diagnosis seems ambiguous or utilizes unfamiliar terminology, the clinician should discuss the findings with the pathologist.

Only approximately 10 percent arise in the head of the pancreas. MCN typically occur in younger women (median age in the 40s) than ductal adenocarcinoma or IPMN (median age in the 60s), although they may be seen in older women. MCN rarely occur in men. MCN are slightly less prevalent than intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>MCN typically do not communicate with the pancreatic duct system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], although a single case with involvement of the main pancreatic duct by a neoplasm with features of both MCN and IPMN has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Three decades ago, MCN and IPMN were not consistently recognized as different neoplasms, and some early publications on mucin-containing cystic pancreatic neoplasms seem to have included both MCN and IPMN. The ability to make a histologic distinction between the two entities has improved over the past two decades.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Histology and grading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epithelium lining the cysts is characteristically columnar with abundant luminal mucin. However, in many large MCN the epithelium is cuboidal and the cells contain little mucin. In low-grade lesions, the epithelium forms a single layer, sometimes forming papillary folds. As lesions become more dysplastic they typically become more papillary, and mitoses may be identified.</p><p>In contrast to IPMN, subtypes based upon epithelial morphology have not been reported in MCN. The histologic hallmark for distinguishing MCN from IPMN is the presence of a highly cellular stromal layer immediately beneath the epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59951\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59951 \">picture 8</a>). This has been called &quot;ovarian stroma&quot; because it is composed of small spindle shaped cells in which estrogen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progesterone receptor expression can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. It is suggested that the stroma plays a pathogenetic role in the development of MCN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Some observers have suggested that the distinction between IPMN and MCN should be based upon the presence (in IPMN) of communication with the pancreatic duct and its absence in mucinous cystic neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the presence of ovarian stroma is the most reliable way to distinguish a MCN from an IPMN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The thickness of the cyst wall is sometimes increased by an outer layer of highly collagenous fibrous tissue that may contain calcified foci. In larger cysts, much of the wall may lack epithelium and be highly collagenous without a layer of ovarian stroma.</p><p>As regards grading, both AFIP and WHO have classified MCN into low-, intermediate-, and high-grade based upon the degree of epithelial dysplasia (similar to IPMN). As mentioned above, it is now recommended to use two-tier grading, low or high grade, for MCN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Low-grade MCN can progress to high-grade dysplasia and to invasive carcinoma.</p><p>MCN with high-grade dysplasia may be either non-invasive (in situ) or invasive. In the largest series of MCN reported to date, 17.3 percent were invasive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. When there is an invasive component, it most often resembles ductal adenocarcinoma. There is some disagreement as to whether MCN ever invades as a colloid carcinoma, and this issue may reflect past confusion between IPMN and MCN. If invasion as a colloid carcinoma occurs, it appears to be rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Serous cystadenoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serous cystadenomas are benign neoplasms that can occur in adults of any age but are most common in older women (mean age in the 60s at diagnosis). A slight majority (50 to 70 percent) arise in the body or tail of the pancreas. Large lesions (&gt;4 cm) are more likely to cause symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Serous cystadenomas classically have a central scar, which may become calcified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61511\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61511 \">picture 9</a>).</p><p>The majority of serous cystadenomas are composed of multiple small cysts, and they have a classic &quot;honeycomb appearance.&quot; All serous cystadenoma variants have similar cuboidal epithelial cells with clear cytoplasm that form a single layer lining the cysts. Histochemically, the cytoplasm stains positive with the Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) stain due to the presence of glycogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79089\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79089 \">picture 10</a>). A minority have fewer large cysts and are designated as macrocystic or oligocystic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Serous cystadenomas, often multiple, are seen in patients with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.

Progression to malignancy (ie, serous cystadenocarcinoma) is distinctly rare in serous neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/3,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,34</a>]. However, malignant potential cannot be accurately predicted on the basis of cytologic changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These neoplasms are of special interest because they occur predominantly in females (90 percent) and at a younger age (mean age in the 20s) than other pancreatic neoplasms except pancreatoblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. However, SPN are also found in older patients. The most common presenting symptom is abdominal pain (64 percent in a large literature-based review of 2744 reported cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]), but many cases are diagnosed incidentally at an asymptomatic stage. The number of incidentally detected SPN has risen dramatically since 2000 coincident with the widespread use of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and transabdominal and endoscopic ultrasound imaging. Cross-sectional imaging reveals large, solitary, well-circumscribed lesions that can have a completely cystic, mixed cystic and solid, or purely solid appearance. </p><p>Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms are equally distributed throughout the pancreas. They begin as solid neoplasms that often become cystic as they grow large and the cells become so far removed their blood supply that they undergo apoptosis or necrosis. Histologically, SPN are composed primarily of polygonal cells with a moderate amount of cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53874\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53874 \">picture 11</a>). Multiple capillary-size vessels traverse the tumor, and when they become cystic, these vessels are surrounded by single or multiple layers of surviving tumor cells, giving the lining an irregular &quot;pseudopapillary&quot; appearance. In the older literature, these neoplasms have been called &quot;solid-cystic tumor,&quot; &quot;papillary cystic neoplasm,&quot; Hamoudi or Frantz tumors, and by many other names, reflecting their complex solid, cystic and &quot;papillary&quot; morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/2,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,35</a>].</p><p>In the past, SPN were classified as having uncertain malignant potential, but more recently they are considered a low-grade malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. Prognosis is generally good [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Among 1952 patients with SPN treated by surgical resection and with a median follow-up of 36 months, disease-free survival was 95.6 percent with recurrence in 4.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The mean time to recurrence was approximately four years, and the author concludes that patients treated for SPN should be followed for a minimum of five years.</p><p>At least one study and literature review&nbsp;suggest that tumors with a high proliferation rate (4 percent or more&nbsp;as assessed by the Ki-67 index) may have a less favorable outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Slight male predominance is noted in some series but the ratio is close to unity in most series. They may develop in the head, body or tail of the pancreas, usually as solid masses. The clinical presentation is that of a large retroperitoneal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-exocrine-pancreatic-neoplasms/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].
