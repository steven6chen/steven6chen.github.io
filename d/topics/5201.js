While availability is no longer a problem, there still remains a number of difficulties with the diagnosis of GHD, resulting mainly from the lack of appropriate tools to make (or exclude) the diagnosis reliably.</p><p>The incidence of short stature associated with GHD has been estimated to be about 1:4000 to 1:10000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Most pediatric endocrinologists agree that the foundation for the diagnosis of GHD in childhood is based on a comparison of the child's growth pattern with established norms.

The single most important clinical manifestation of GHD is growth failure, and careful documentation of growth rate is critical to making the correct diagnosis. In some cases of congenital GHD or hypopituitarism, the growth failure may not be manifested until late infancy, as noted below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with congenital, severe GHD have only a slightly reduced birth length and may not immediately show growth failure. There is a higher frequency of breech presentation and perinatal asphyxia. Neonatal morbidity may include hypoglycemia and prolonged jaundice.</p><p>When GHD is combined with deficiency of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), hypoglycemia may be severe. The combination of GHD with gonadotropin deficiency can cause microphallus, cryptorchidism, and hypoplasia of the scrotum.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Auxology'</a> above.)</p><p>The clinical significance of the short stature depends on many factors, especially height velocity, severity of the short stature, and genetic potential. Many children with moderate short stature and normal growth (eg, height velocity [HV] at least 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> between four and six years of age, and at least 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> between six years and puberty) require only a basic evaluation (including bone age evaluation), as outlined in a separate topic review.

This is accomplished through a thorough medical history and physical examination. Laboratory evaluation should be performed when appropriate, including screens for systemic disease, undernutrition, inflammation, and thyroid function, and a karyotype in girls to rule out Turner syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Laboratory and imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p>If there is no evidence of these disorders, then the possibility of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) should be investigated with the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone age </p><p/><p>GHD is effectively excluded in children with a normal bone age and height velocity. In this case, provocative testing for GHD is not required. </p><p>When GHD is congenital and near-complete, the diagnosis is relatively easy to confirm, because affected children present with severe growth failure, delayed bone age, and very low serum concentrations of GH, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For patients with all of these clinical characteristics, it is reasonable to make the diagnosis of GHD without performing GH stimulation testing. </p><p>Milder degrees of growth failure and decreases in IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels are consistent with GHD, but are also consistent with other causes of growth failure, including poor nutrition. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'IGF-I and IGFBP-3'</a> below.) </p><p>Abnormal results of IGF-I <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IGFBP-3 levels should be confirmed by provocative GH testing if not explicable on the basis of undernutrition. In addition, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hypothalamic-pituitary region is recommended for children with suspected GHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The regulation of GH secretion involves at least two well-studied hypothalamic factors, growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) (stimulatory) and somatostatin (inhibitory). In addition, GH secretion is influenced by multiple other peptides and neurotransmitters, including ghrelin (stimulatory) produced both in the hypothalamus and in the stomach, which causes stimulation of GHRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Between normal pulses of GH secretion, serum GH levels are often low, below the limits of sensitivity of most conventional assays. Thus, measurement of a random serum GH level is not helpful in diagnosing GHD, and is used only to exclude the possibility of GH insensitivity. </p><p>Because of these issues, the diagnosis of GHD is made with a combination of clinical assessment and auxology, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels, and GH stimulation tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">IGF-I and IGFBP-3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The determination of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 levels has become a widely used tool in the diagnostic evaluation of growth disorders.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Which children require evaluation?'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected GHD should be screened with radiographic measurement of bone age and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and serum levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). We interpret the results of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 testing as follows (see <a href=\"#H3047011398\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of results'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderately or severely reduced IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 (eg, SD &lt;-1.3) <strong>with</strong> delayed bone age &ndash; In most cases, the possibility of GHD should be explored by provocative growth hormone (GH) testing, if other causes of low IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, such as poor nutrition, have been excluded. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'GH stimulation tests'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Somewhat low IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 (eg, SD between 0 and -1.3) - The decision about whether to perform provocative GH testing depends on individual patient characteristics, including the severity of growth failure, degree of bone age delay, and whether the low levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 can be explained by other factors, such as poor nutrition. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clearly normal IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 (SD &ge;0; ie, in the upper half of the normal range) &ndash; GHD is extremely unlikely, and no further testing is required. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If GH stimulation tests are undertaken for children with suspected isolated GHD (ie, with no evidence of other pituitary hormone deficiencies), testing with two different provocative tests is recommended to establish the diagnosis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Clonidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">arginine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a> are common choices in children. Hypothyroidism should be excluded first by performing thyroid function tests. Provocative GH testing has a number of limitations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51347 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'GH stimulation tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GH stimulation testing is <strong>not</strong> necessary for selected patients in whom other clinical criteria are sufficient to make the diagnosis of GHD, including those with a known pituitary abnormality (congenital anomaly, tumor, or irradiation) and known deficiency of at least one other pituitary hormone, with marked growth failure. (See <a href=\"#H4155928927\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If GHD is confirmed, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hypothalamic-pituitary area is recommended to investigate to rule out tumors, investigate for structural causes of GHD, and to evaluate the severity and prognosis of the deficiency.
