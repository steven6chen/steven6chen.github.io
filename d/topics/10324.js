This includes fondling and all forms of oral-genital, genital, or anal contact with the child (whether the victim is clothed or unclothed), as well as non-touching abuses, such as exhibitionism, voyeurism, or involving the child in pornography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The management and sequelae of childhood sexual abuse will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, evaluation, and differential diagnosis of childhood sexual abuse and human sex trafficking are discussed separately.

Psychosocial support and anticipatory guidance should also be offered to the victims and their non-offending caregivers.</p><p>Although evaluation and management of sexual abuse should be performed by an experienced child abuse team, including a child abuse specialist or clinician with similar experience, whenever possible, urgent evaluation is necessary under the following circumstances and typically occurs in an emergent setting (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The alleged abuse occurred within the previous 72 to 96 hours, depending upon jurisdiction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are genital or anal injuries that require treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is obvious forensic evidence on the patient&rsquo;s clothes or body that must be collected</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is danger of continued abuse or reprisal by the alleged perpetrator</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The victim has reported homicidal or suicidal ideation or other emergent complaints</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexually transmitted infection prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for STI prophylaxis depends upon whether the patient is pre- or postpubertal:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prepubertal </strong>&ndash; We suggest that prepubertal children who have no symptoms of STI <strong>not</strong> receive antibiotic prophylaxis. STI prophylaxis is not routinely recommended for prepubertal victims for the following reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The incidence of infections is low after sexual assault in this patient population.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prepubertal girls have a lower risk of ascending infections.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Follow up is typically assured.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Excessive concern by the caregiver or child concerning STI may make prophylactic treatment appropriate. However, cultures must be obtained prior to treatment whenever prophylaxis is prescribed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infection testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Diagnoses of STIs in pre-pubertal children have profound consequences for the child, family and alleged perpetrator and are likely to be challenged in court. Because cultures can miss some STIs, prophylaxis can complicate efforts to protect children when initial testing is in doubt. Given the low risk of ascending infection in pre-pubertal children, it is reasonable to withhold treatment until all follow-up testing is complete and a definitive diagnosis has been established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postpubertal</strong> &ndash; We suggest that postpubertal children who have been sexually abused receive antibiotic prophylaxis for STIs. Post-pubertal females should definitely be offered STI prophylaxis if the assailant is known to be infected, the victim has signs or symptoms of infection, or at the victim&rsquo;s request. Additional considerations are the high prevalence of preexisting asymptomatic infection, the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and the possibility of loss to follow up. For these reasons, STI prophylaxis is routinely offered even when there are no symptoms and the infection status of the assailant is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some experts recommend that all postpubertal patients be screened for STIs, including HIV, because the prevalence of preexisting asymptomatic infection is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Others do not routinely test for STI because identification of an infection is unlikely to provide useful evidence and prophylactic treatment is typically prescribed regardless of culture results. Therefore, the decision to test a victim of sexual abuse for STIs should be made on an individual basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Testing of for STI in pediatric victims of sexual abuse is covered in greater detail separately.

Most data regarding safety and efficacy are extrapolated from late adolescents and young adults. Guidelines for the treatment of specific STI are regularly updated by the CDC and are available on its <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/default.htm&amp;token=UdAMcdIJLprxDltpT5s5T1HPjxh02tCz1gE31DUzI5Fr17n0QPJGxWmPGGKzZL77I8w4x4ug+/L3xAdh5cXs4Q==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6607\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The risk of transmission of the virus may be greater in girls than in adult women because vaginal epithelium in children is thin and adolescents have more cervical ectopy than adults. In addition, children may have been exposed to the same perpetrator repeatedly over time.</p><p>Recommendations for HIV prophylaxis are generalized from the model for occupational HIV exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For adult rape victims, antiretroviral prophylaxis is generally recommended if it can be initiated within 72 hours of exposure, and ideally within four hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims&quot;, section on 'HIV infection'</a>.)</p><p>For children and adolescents, decisions regarding HIV prophylaxis are usually made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the following factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The likelihood that the perpetrator is HIV-positive</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nature of the sexual contact and its estimated risk for HIV transmission (eg, whether it involved transfer of secretions, injury, or multiple perpetrators)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The time elapsed since the first contact</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the victim has other ongoing risk factors for HIV infection</p><p/><p>Non-adherence to HIV prophylaxis among sexual assault survivors appears to be prevalent. In several retrospective studies describing HIV prophylaxis for pediatric and adult sexual assault victims, between 13 and 24 percent of patients completed the full 28-day prophylaxis regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Non-adherence to the prophylaxis regimen may limit its effectiveness, as well as increase the likelihood that the patient will develop viral resistance. Consequently, the decision to initiate antiretroviral therapy must include counseling for the victim and family and close follow-up. Consultation with a specialist in treating HIV-infected children is advised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For clinicians in the United States, the Warmline National HIV telephone consultation service (1-800-933-3413) is also available to provide current HIV clinical and drug information and expert case consultation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79334572\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis B prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Victims of sexual abuse warrant assessment for hepatitis B prophylaxis. The approach depends upon whether the perpetrator is known to be hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and the vaccination status of the victim (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F106531\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106531 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the perpetrator is not HBsAg positive and the victim is fully immunized, then no action is needed. Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated patients should receive hepatitis B vaccine at the initial evaluation with ensured completion of the vaccine series using an age-appropriate dose and schedule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60075 \">table 2</a>).

Emergency contraceptive preparations and administration are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency contraception&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The overall risk of pregnancy resulting from a sexual assault is 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The highest risk of pregnancy occurs during the three days preceding and including ovulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58851 \">table 3</a>). Knowing the timing of the event in relation to the patient's ovulatory period is helpful in further assessing risk.

For this reason, HPV vaccination is recommended at age 9 years of age or older as a preventative measure among those children who have a known or suspected history of sexual abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Indications for hospitalization in child or adolescent victims of sexual abuse include severe injury requiring treatment or when the home environment is unsafe and there are no alternatives for placement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The child's physical and emotional well-being is of primary concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Whenever possible, involvement of a social worker with experience supporting victims of sexual abuse should occur during the initial evaluation. The child should be reassured that what happened was not the child's fault and that he or she did nothing wrong. Children in whom sexual abuse is confirmed or suspected should be referred to a mental health professional for evaluation and counseling. The family of the victim may also need treatment and support to cope with the emotional trauma of their child's abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>For children who develop psychological sequelae as the result of sexual abuse, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), as part of a broader psychosocial intervention, may be helpful. In a systematic review that described 10 randomized trials, CBT appeared to have a positive, though not statistically significant, impact on immediate and longer-term sequelae among children who had been sexually abused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticipatory guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children whose examination is normal, the patient and family should be informed that the absence of physical findings does not exclude abuse. For patients with abnormal physical findings, the differential diagnosis must be discussed with the family.

The potential risks of STIs (including HIV), as well as decisions to perform cultures or provide prophylactic therapy, should also be addressed.

Listening to family concerns and providing reassurance are often the most important aspects of the evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The support that children receive from non-offending caregivers has significant impact on the child&rsquo;s psychological recovery from sexual abuse. The presence of an adult who believes and supports the child is vital to recovery and can have a larger impact than abuse-related factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Caregivers often struggle with how to best assist a child after sexual abuse. Stressing the importance of their emotional support is beneficial to the caregiver as well as the child.</p><p>Parents may wonder whether they should attempt to gain further history or details of the assault from their child.&nbsp;Parents should be counseled that questioning by an untrained interviewer may complicate further forensic interviews or investigations, but that the child should always feel safe and listened-to should they decide to discuss the episode.&nbsp;In short, the parent should be open to any history the child gives, but should not attempt to obtain further detail themselves. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mandated reporting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physicians in many countries (eg, United States, Canada, Germany, and Japan) are required to report all cases of suspected or known child sexual abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>].

There is evidence that Child Advocacy&nbsp;Centers&nbsp;and the&nbsp;multidisciplinary&nbsp;team&nbsp;approach&nbsp;for&nbsp;child&nbsp;sexual&nbsp;abuse investigations may aid in improving&nbsp;prosecution&nbsp;rates of suspected perpetrators&nbsp;and the experiences of families of patients with suspected sexual abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of all children who have been sexually abused must include attention to the immediate medical and social needs of patients and families, as well as to the local requirements for mandated reporting. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With regard to prophylactic treatments to prevent sexually transmitted infections, we offer the following recommendations (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Sexually transmitted infection prophylaxis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that prepubertal children who have no symptoms of sexually transmitted infection (STI) <strong>not</strong> receive antibiotic prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Children who are prescribed prophylaxis should have specimens sent for culture prior to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Sexually transmitted infection prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infection testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that postpubertal children who have been sexually abused receive antibiotic prophylaxis for STIs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The decision to obtain cultures prior to the initiation of treatment should be made on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Sexually transmitted infection prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinicians considering prescribing HIV prophylaxis for children who have been sexually abused should consult with a specialist in treating HIV-infected children. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'HIV prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Guidelines for the treatment of specific STIs are regularly updated by the CDC and are available on its <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/std&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsVZ9nhUrCMsqPC6cGzTfqmg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6607\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Victims of sexual abuse warrant assessment for hepatitis prophylaxis. The approach depends upon whether the perpetrator is known to be hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and the vaccination status of the victim. (See <a href=\"#H79334572\" class=\"local\">'Hepatitis B prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency contraception should be offered to all postpubertal female patients and should be strongly advised to females at highest risk for pregnancy. Emergency contraceptive preparations and administration are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency contraception&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who have been sexually abused may experience psychological and behavioral sequelae. They and their families should be offered a referral to a mental health professional. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Sequelae'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physicians in many countries (eg, United States, Canada, Germany, and Japan) are required to report all cases of suspected or known child sexual abuse. The designated agency to which sexual abuse should be reported varies by region; physicians should be aware of the local laws.
