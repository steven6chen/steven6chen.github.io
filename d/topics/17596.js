The clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-spondylotic-myelopathy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical spondylotic myelopathy&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimum treatment of compressive cervical radiculopathy is the subject of continued debate, and initial management may vary significantly among practitioners. There is sparse evidence that any treatment improves upon the natural history of the condition.</p><p>Despite uncertainty regarding effectiveness, we suggest conservative therapy as initial treatment for most patients with compressive cervical radiculopathy who have clear radicular pain and symptoms of paresthesia or numbness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109708\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109708 \">algorithm 1</a>). In addition, we suggest conservative therapy as initial treatment for patients with cervical radiculopathy who have nonprogressive neurologic deficits, including dermatomal sensory loss and myotomal weakness, as long as myelopathy is not suspected. All patients with motor weakness should be closely followed for evidence of progression. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Conservative therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical reevaluation should be performed after six to eight weeks of conservative treatment, with assessment for motor weakness and myelopathic findings in patients who have not improved or in those who have progressive symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Refractory or progressive symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients with confirmed cervical radiculopathy who have severe or disabling pain despite a reasonable course (six to eight weeks) of conservative therapy, and who do not have a progressively worsening neurologic deficit, we suggest the use of epidural glucocorticoid injections rather than surgery. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Epidural glucocorticoid injections'</a> below.)</p><p>We suggest surgery only for patients with cervical radiculopathy who have cervical nerve root compression by MRI or CT myelography at the appropriate side and level(s) and persistence of radicular pain despite aggressive nonsurgical therapy for at least 6 to 12 weeks, as well as progressive motor weakness that impairs function regardless of duration. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NONSURGICAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main components of nonsurgical therapy: conservative therapy and epidural glucocorticoid injections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Conservative therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the apparent overall good prognosis for recovery (see <a href=\"#H1130816746\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below), conservative therapies are preferred for most patients with compressive cervical radiculopathy. Conservative therapy typically consists of the following modalities, alone or in some combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral analgesics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A short course of oral corticosteroids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of provocative activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-term neck immobilization with a hard or soft cervical collar <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cervical pillow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy with exercise and gradual mobilization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical traction</p><p/><p>Few randomized trials have evaluated the effectiveness of these treatments. One trial of 205 adults with acute cervical radiculopathy diagnosed by a neurologist found that treatment with either physical therapy and home exercises for six weeks or a cervical collar and rest for three to six weeks was superior to no treatment (control) for reduction in neck and arm pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Observational studies suggest that conservative therapy for cervical radiculopathy is associated with complete resolution of pain and neurologic deficits in 40 to 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. However, it remains uncertain whether conservative therapy improves upon the natural history of cervical radiculopathy.</p><p>There is no consensus regarding the sequence or time course of conservative modalities. We generally start treatment with oral analgesics and avoidance of provocative activities, accompanied by a short course of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> if pain is severe. For oral analgesia, we typically use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-line therapy. We avoid the use of narcotic agents. Medications for neuropathic pain, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, are sometimes used in the treatment of in cervical radiculopathy, but this practice is not well-supported by evidence.</p><p>A muscle relaxant such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclobenzaprine</a> may be added if muscle spasm or muscle tightness is prominent. Cyclobenzaprine is generally started at a modest dose of 5 mg two or three times a day to reduce the side effect of drowsiness. The dose can be increased to 10 mg three times a day after one week if spasm is not relieved and side effects are not prominent.</p><p>Shoulder abduction, which can be used as a diagnostic sign, can also be useful for temporary symptom relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;, section on 'Shoulder abduction relief test'</a>.)</p><p>Once the pain is tolerable, we initiate physical therapy with exercise and gradual mobilization. In our opinion, prolonged inactivity may delay recovery and is not advisable.</p><p>The patient should be seen and reexamined in six to eight weeks if there is no improvement with these conservative measures. In this setting, neuroimaging studies of the cervical spine and electrodiagnostic studies should be performed if they were not done initially. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Refractory or progressive symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A short course of high-dose oral glucocorticoid therapy may be used as initial treatment for patients with severe cervical radicular pain. The evidence supporting the effectiveness of oral glucocorticoids for cervical radiculopathy is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. In our clinical experience, for example, this treatment is associated with pain relief in many patients.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Prednisone</a> 60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for five days, followed by a taper off the medication over the ensuing 5 to 14 days, is a typical regimen. We suggest not using prophylaxis against gastrointestinal bleeding in patients taking prednisone alone. In contrast, patients taking prednisone in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or other NSAIDs may require prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;, section on 'Prevention strategies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical therapy, range-of-motion exercises, strengthening exercises, and aerobic exercises are frequently employed as conservative measures for cervical radiculopathy. These treatments are unproven, and the few controlled trials showed conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].</p><p>Many patients report benefit with exercise therapy, but this could reflect the natural history of the disease or a placebo response. Because of possible benefit and no proven harm, we suggest exercise therapy as part of the initial treatment of symptomatic cervical radiculopathy in the absence of myelopathy. Some experts advise that exercise therapy is contraindicated in the presence of myelopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-spondylotic-myelopathy#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical spondylotic myelopathy&quot;, section on 'Conservative measures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Cervical traction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical traction is the application of a distracting force to the neck, which can in theory separate the cervical segments, expand the intervertebral joint spaces, and relieve compression of the nerve roots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. We generally do not prescribe cervical traction as therapy for patients with cervical radiculopathy. Nevertheless, cervical traction is a reasonably safe alternative for patients with persistent or refractory pain who do not want epidural glucocorticoid injections or surgery.</p><p>Controlled studies of cervical traction delivered in the course of a physical therapy program for a variety of causes of neck and arm pain have not demonstrated benefit over sham traction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There are no meta-analyses or systematic reviews of traction as treatment for the specific diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy. A 2006 systematic review of traction for patients with mechanical neck disorders reported that the evidence of benefit for traction was inconclusive, due to low methodologic quality of the trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Traction should not be used unless neuroimaging has been performed, and should be discontinued if symptoms worsen with the application of distracting force. Traction is <strong>not</strong> recommended in the presence of spinal cord compression or large disc protrusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Refractory or progressive symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with cervical radiculopathy have symptoms that are refractory to conservative treatments, and a smaller number develop progressive symptoms.</p><p>Clinical reevaluation should be performed with careful assessment for motor weakness and myelopathic findings in patients who have not improved after six to eight weeks of conservative treatment or in those who have progressive symptoms. Neuroimaging and electrodiagnostic studies are indicated, particularly if not done initially, and repeat electrodiagnostic studies may be needed if an initial study was unrevealing.</p><p>Reevaluation, neuroimaging, and electrodiagnostic studies are important to ensure that the initial diagnosis of radiculopathy is correct, and to assess for evidence of progressive neurologic deficit that could be an indication for surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no clinical trials that clearly establish whether more aggressive interventions, such as epidural glucocorticoid injections or surgery, are beneficial for patients who are refractory to conservative therapy or beneficial for those who have progressive symptoms or signs. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Epidural glucocorticoid injections'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Nevertheless, many experts consider unremitting radicular pain despite six to eight weeks of conservative treatment, progressive motor weakness, or signs and symptoms of myelopathy (in the context of imaging studies showing a surgically remediable anatomic spinal cord compression) as indications for surgery.

However, these observational studies cannot distinguish between improvement due to treatment or to the natural history of cervical radiculopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No benefit of epidural glucocorticoid injection was found in a small trial that randomly assigned patients with cervical radiculopathy to treatment with either local anesthesia and epidural glucocorticoid injection (n = 20) or local anesthesia and saline injection (n = 20) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The needle should remain in contact with the posterior wall of the intervertebral foramen; this position avoids contact with the nerve root, spinal nerve, and associated vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65832 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Test injections of small amounts of nonionic contrast can confirm entry of the needle into the epidural space and demonstrate whether the injectate spreads onto the injured nerve root(s). Test contrast injections can also reveal inadvertent intraarterial injection. The use of computed tomography (CT) fluoroscopy for guidance may provide improved anatomic detail compared with standard fluoroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Serious complications of cervical epidural glucocorticoid injections are rare, but the precise incidence of such complications is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The main disadvantage is that there may be more postoperative pain with PLF than with ACDF, although this is controllable with medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/38,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Artificial disc replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Artificial cervical disc replacement surgery or cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) is a developing technique for the treatment of single level cervical radiculopathy that has been used in situations when an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) would otherwise be appropriate. Mounting evidence suggests that CDA is equal or superior to ACDF in terms of clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. In a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of eight randomized controlled trials and over 2300 subjects comparing CDA with ACDF with at least four years of follow-up, pooled analysis found that CDA led to significantly higher rates of success on most clinical outcome measures (eg, overall success, neurologic success, improvement of disability scores) and lower rates of implant or surgically-related serious adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of surgery for cervical radiculopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> myelopathy are uncommon, but include spinal cord injury (&lt;1 percent of cases), nerve root injury (2 to 3 percent), and instrumentation or device failure (&le;4 percent).
