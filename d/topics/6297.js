There are two forms of the disease: an acute form occurring mainly in East Africa and caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</em> and a more chronic form occurring mainly in West and Central Africa, caused by <em>Trypanosoma brucei gambiense</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86457 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These two species have identical morphologic appearances and both are transmitted by tsetse flies of the genus <em>Glossina</em>. However, the clinical features of infection differ in presentation and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Other <em>Trypanosoma</em> species include <em>T. brucei </em>subspecies<em> brucei, T. lewisi, T. congolense</em>, and <em>T. evansi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/5-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-11</a>] Serum resistance factors lyse animal trypanosomes (including <em>Trypanosoma evansi</em>) and prevent infection in humans, unless there is a host genetic deficiency for these factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, lifecycle, and prevention of African trypanosomiasis will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of these infections are discussed separately.

The 1920s epidemic was arrested using mobile teams that systematically screened millions of at-risk individuals. The disease practically disappeared between 1960 and 1965, and, subsequently, surveillance was relaxed. Civil wars, displacement of people, economic difficulties, and slackening in vector control measures subsequently allowed reemergence of disease in several foci.</p><p>Sleeping sickness occurs in approximately 30 sub-Saharan African countries within the distribution of the tsetse fly. There are about 70 million people at risk for infection (including 57 million at risk of <em>T. b. gambiense</em> infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], although the risk of acquiring infection is steadily declining (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86653\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86653 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/4,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14,15</a>]. Countries particularly affected include the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Angola, and the Central African Republic (all of which have <em>T. b. gambiense</em> disease), Uganda (which has both <em>T. b. gambiense</em> and <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> disease), and Tanzania, Malawi, and Zambia (which have <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].</p><p>The difficulty in estimating the incidence and prevalence of African trypanosomiasis is exacerbated by the remoteness of affected regions and the focal nature of disease transmission (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59127\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59127 \">figure 2</a>). In 1999, 45,000 cases of HAT were reported to the World Health Organization (WHO); at least 10 times as many cases are likely not reported, causing an estimated 100,000 deaths to occur each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The estimates have declined with implementation of concerted control measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; from 2010 to 2013, approximately 7000 cases were reported to the WHO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/13,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23-25</a>].</p><p>Many previously endemic countries have been disease free for more than a decade (including Ghana and the Gambia); several other countries report &lt;500 cases per year (including Gabon, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Malawi). Most cases occur in the Democratic Republic of Congo (&gt;70 percent of cases; &gt;500 cases per year), followed by South Sudan, Angola, and the Central African Republic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24</a>].</p><p>The occurrence of HAT in a region often reflects war, civil unrest, and lack of a reliable presence of state authority. Therefore, nearly by definition, HAT as a public health problem occurs in areas where there is no research infrastructure; thus, many important questions of clinical and operational research remain unanswered.</p><p>Travelers to game park areas near Lake Victoria are at risk of <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. One report described the acquisition of infection in two travelers from the United States who went on safari in Tanzania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other reports have described clusters of infection among European tourists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>], highlighting the potential for emergence of this disease in international travelers, particularly those traveling to the Tarangire and Serengeti, including the Masai Mara (previously not known to be an area at risk) and Lake Manyara National Parks. Other cases have been imported from Zambia and Zimbabwe. Given the rarity of imported HAT and the challenges associated with diagnosis, it must be actively excluded in travelers at risk. Cases of <em>T. b. gambiense</em> are most commonly found in immigrants or expatriate workers who have spent time in endemic areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14020275\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifecycle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans are the main reservoir for <em>T. b. gambiense</em>; this species can also be found in some animals, including domestic pigs. Wild game animals and cattle are the main reservoir of <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em>.</p><p>During a blood meal, an infected tsetse fly injects trypomastigotes into the host skin tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F85844\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85844 \">figure 3</a>). A painful chancre (local inflammatory reaction) can develop at the site of inoculation. The parasites enter regional lymphatics and then disseminate widely in the bloodstream, where the metacyclic trypomastigotes differentiate to long, slender forms that measure 15 to 35 mcm. These can be seen on blood smear examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F85845\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef85845 \">picture 1</a>) and are characterized by a flagellum and a kinetoplast (an organelle associated with the mitochondrion containing extranuclear DNA). Trypomastigotes can pass through the walls of blood and lymphatic vessels into connective tissues and thereby enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain.</p><p>When ingested by a tsetse fly during a blood meal, trypomastigotes move to the midgut, transform into procyclic trypomastigotes with different developmental, morphologic, and metabolic characteristics, and undergo replication. After approximately three weeks, they migrate to the salivary gland, where they develop into epimastigotes and finally into new metacyclic trypomastigotes that are ready to be transmitted to another host.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HAT is transmitted to humans via the bite of a tsetse fly (<em>Glossina</em> spp). Tsetse flies tend to be found in warm, shaded areas and have an average lifespan of one to six months. Once infected with trypanosomes, they remain infective for life. Flies are attracted by large moving objects and are especially drawn to dark colors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Tsetse flies are restricted to the African continent where they occur in 31 species and subspecies, though not all tsetse flies play a role in the transmission of sleeping sickness. <em>T. b. gambiense</em> is transmitted via tsetse flies mainly of the <em>Glossina palpalis</em> group, and <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> is transmitted via tsetse flies mainly of the <em>Glossina morsitans</em> group. These flies are found in tropical Africa between 14&deg; north and 19&deg; south of the equator, which defines the geographic range for transmission of HAT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86653\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86653 \">figure 1</a>). The two vector groups have different biting habits that result in different epidemiologic features for Gambian and Rhodesian trypanosomiasis.</p><p>The <em>Glossina palpalis</em> vector requires humidity and prefers dense riverine habitats in West and Central Africa. These flies are both zoophilic and anthropophilic but preferentially feed on humans, which are the main reservoir of infection. Humans are exposed to bites during bathing and washing in small rivers or pools of water in rural areas.</p><p>The <em>Glossina morsitans</em> vector lives in drier and more open areas of woodlands and savannas in East Africa. These flies are mainly zoophilic and prefer to feed on wild animals such as antelope (bushbucks) or on domestic animals such as cattle and goats. Wild animals are the main reservoir for <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> infection. These tsetse flies do not bite humans frequently, but farmers, hunters, or others who enter woodland areas and thickets where flies breed are at risk of incidental infection. In certain parts of East Africa, <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> is transmitted by a riverine species of tsetse fly, and this transmission is associated with greater epidemic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Other means of transmission are rare but include transmission via blood transfusion, laboratory inoculation, and congenital infection, which can result in abortion or perinatal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Urban transmission is rare but has been described in Libreville, Gabon, and Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the lifecycle of <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>, there is modulation of the exposed surface antigens of the parasite. Metacyclic trypanosomes in the tsetse fly and bloodstream forms in mammalian and human hosts have proteins on their surface known as major variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). Each trypanosome is covered with approximately 10 million copies of a single VSG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Innate immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Innate immunity against <em>T. brucei</em> is due to the trypanolytic activity of apolipoprotein L-I (APOL1), which is bound to high-density lipoproteins in human serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This protein is taken up in the parasite by endocytosis and triggers osmotic swelling of the lysosomal compartment with subsequent cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The importance of the APOL1 protein in innate immunity has been demonstrated by the onset of human disease when parasites have acquired resistance to APOL1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] or when patients have mutations in the <em>APOL1</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Evasion of host defense</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>T. brucei</em> parasites can evade destruction by the mammalian host immune response in the bloodstream by periodically switching their VSG, a phenomenon known as antigenic variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. This results in characteristic waves of parasitemia during human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) infection. Trypanosomes express a different VSG during each successive wave of parasitemia and change their surface VSG each time the host begins to mount an effective immune response. In this way, the parasite is able to stay one step ahead of the host's immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This process also leads to nonspecific activation of the host humoral immune response, which can induce false-positive antibody-based tests used to diagnose other infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Other mechanisms enabling <em>T. brucei</em> parasites to survive despite host immune defenses include their ability to grow in the presence of high levels of interferon-gamma and to avoid complement-mediated destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. One study identified two different genotypes of the parasite circulating simultaneously in the same patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antigenic variation leads to nonspecific polyclonal B cell activation during infection and immunoglobulin M is produced in large quantities. Immune complexes form, and secondary hyperplasia of the reticuloendothelial system occurs, particularly involving the spleen and lymph nodes. This process may lead to downregulation of the immune system. Therefore, generalized suppression of humoral and cellular immune responses may be seen in advanced stages of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The relative contribution of immune complex deposition, inflammatory infiltrates, vascular infiltration, and direct parasite invasion to organ damage in African trypanosomiasis is uncertain; it is likely that the pathogenesis of HAT reflects a complex combination of these mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333238\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two major tools to prevent transmission of infection are vector control and surveillance (with early treatment of identified cases). There is no vaccine available for human African trypanosomiasis (HAT); the parasite's ability to undergo antigenic switching makes vaccine development challenging, although there is some evidence that natural immunity develops following infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333245\"><span class=\"h2\">Vector control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional approaches include aerial insecticide spraying and reduction of wild animal populations in attempts to reduce tsetse populations in an area. Subsequently, vector control has focused on tsetse fly traps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86884\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86884 \">picture 2</a>) and insecticide-treated screens. Insecticide impregnation must be repeated every three to four months, necessitating sustained programs in order for this approach to be effective. When epidemics occur and more rapid vector control is required, ground or aerial spraying of insecticides in tsetse breeding sites can be employed. Thus far, insecticidal resistance has not been reported among tsetse flies. Removal of the woody vegetation that forms the usual habitat for the flies can also be helpful. Vector control is the primary prevention tool for <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em>. Some limited success with the release of irradiated sterile male flies has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], but this approach is unlikely to be applied on a larger scale.</p><p>African governments have implemented an initiative known as the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign, which employs suppression methods to eradicate flies from areas of tsetse infestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333252\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveillance aims to reduce the human reservoir of infection by identifying human cases and instituting early treatment during the asymptomatic phase of infection. This is helpful for controlling human disease as well as reducing <em>T. b. gambiense</em> transmission.</p><p>Surveillance tools include screening for clinical lymphadenopathy and field use of the card agglutination test for <em>T. b. gambiense</em> trypanosomes (CATT). Individuals found to be CATT positive should undergo further investigation including lymph node aspiration and blood smear examination. Those with evidence of trypanosomal infection should be treated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=african-trypanosomiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;African trypanosomiasis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal management of individuals who are CATT positive and trypanosome negative is uncertain. Some of these represent false-positive results, while others represent individuals with asymptomatic infection and low numbers of circulating parasites. When available, more sensitive tests such as blood concentration techniques or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) might be useful to determine the best approach for these individuals. In the absence of additional diagnostic data, most individuals in endemic areas who are CATT positive and trypanosome negative need not be treated, provided there are no cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities.</p><p>Ideally, screening for <em>T. b. gambiense</em> should be undertaken twice a year in endemic communities; however, surveillance is performed among less than 10 percent of those at risk for HAT. Case detection is difficult and requires substantial human, technical, and material resources. The problem is especially challenging since the disease is rife in rural areas among poor people with little access to health facilities.</p><p>Surveillance is not practical for control of <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> infection because asymptomatic human infection is rare. Therefore, the only prevention tools consist of vector control and veterinary measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/african-trypanosomiasis-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-prevention/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In the areas where <em>T. b. rhodesiense</em> infections occur, febrile diseases are frequently misdiagnosed as malaria. Healthcare workers must be trained to recognize trypanosomiasis in order to care for individual patients and to detect possible outbreaks.</p><p>In public health terms, <em>T. b. gambiense</em> is the more important parasite. The regions with the highest prevalence and the largest populations at risk are in countries where political instability and poor infrastructure prevail. The resurgence of HAT in war-ridden areas in the late 1990s was a direct consequence of the political reality in parts of the African continent at the time. Numbers of reported cases are declining, although real control of HAT can be achieved only with combined and sustained efforts. With decreasing numbers of cases, public interest, political commitment, and sustainable funding may fade, which would likely lead to another epidemic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333259\"><span class=\"h2\">Advice for travelers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Travelers to endemic areas should be warned to avoid areas known to harbor tsetse flies, wear protective clothing, use insect repellents, and seek medical care early if symptoms develop.
