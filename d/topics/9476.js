In the United States, IDA affects an estimated 9 to 16 percent of young women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Less than 1 percent of adolescent males had iron deficiency. Studies in other countries have found higher rates of iron deficiency in male and female adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Some of the variation in incidence noted among different studies is related to the controversy regarding the appropriate laboratory cutoffs to make the diagnosis.

Adolescents with any of these risk factors should have laboratory screening for anemia with a complete blood count (CBC) during health supervision or specialty clinic visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H22449346\" class=\"local\">'Whom to screen'</a> below.) </p><p>Overweight and obese children also appear to be at increased risk for iron deficiency and should undergo screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In one study, the prevalence of iron deficiency was 2.1 percent among children with healthy weight and 5.5 percent among obese children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Obesity was a risk factor for iron deficiency anemia in both boys and girls, but rates were approximately three times higher in girls. The etiology of anemia in obese individuals is uncertain but may be related to low-quality diets or increased needs relative to body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>In addition, adolescent athletes, particularly those participating in endurance training, following alternative diets (vegetarian), or females at menarche, appear to be at risk for iron deficiency and should be screened as part of the pre-sport physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].

The RDAs for iron during adolescence are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ages 9 to 13 years &ndash; 8 mg for boys and girls </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ages 14 to 18 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>11 mg for boys</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>15 mg for girls</p><p/><p>Iron requirements are substantially higher for pregnant adolescents and women.

There is a wide variation in this loss; about 20 percent of women require 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of iron or more. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGES OF IRON DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laboratory manifestations of iron deficiency occur in several stages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76236 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. These stages are defined by the extent of depletion, first of iron stores, and then of iron available for hemoglobin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Eventually, the iron and hemoglobin deficiency is so severe that iron-deficient red cell production occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first stage, iron stores can be depleted totally without causing anemia. The storage pool can be looked upon as a reserve of iron that can be utilized when the need for hemoglobin synthesis is increased (eg, with acute blood loss or growth in adolescents). Once these stores are depleted, the amount of iron present in the body is still within the &quot;labile&quot; iron pool from the daily turnover of red cells for normal hemoglobin synthesis, but the patient is now vulnerable to development of anemia should further iron losses occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71736\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71736 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional iron loss results in iron-restricted erythropoiesis, resulting in a decrease in both the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (CHr or Retic-he). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finally, the deficiency results in the classical hypochromic and microcytic anemia, with a decrease in hemoglobin concentration as the final marker of iron deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64267\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64267 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p>The erythropoietin (EPO) concentration is appropriately elevated in iron deficiency anemia, but the absolute reticulocyte count usually is not increased because iron deficiency (specifically a reduction in transferrin-bound plasma iron) becomes rate-limiting for erythropoiesis, thereby impairing the erythropoietic response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many adolescents with iron deficiency are asymptomatic or have unrecognized, non-specific symptoms and are identified only by the findings of anemia or low ferritin on laboratory testing. When symptoms arise, they are caused primarily by anemia and include weakness, headache, irritability, syncope, and varying degrees of fatigue and exercise intolerance. Patients may also experience symptoms of pica without recognizing its association with iron deficiency. </p><p>Iron deficiency <strong>without</strong> anemia is also associated with clinical symptoms in some patients, including effects on fatigue, cognitive function, energy, and restless legs syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Placebo-controlled trials in adults have demonstrated improvement with oral or intravenous (IV) iron supplementation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H9250420\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Iron deficiency without anemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency can impair cognitive function in adolescents. This impairment was illustrated in a study in which 81 adolescent girls with nonanemic iron deficiency (serum ferritin &le;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/L</span> with normal hemoglobin concentration) were randomly assigned to receive oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> (130 mg elemental iron twice daily) or placebo for eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The girls who received iron showed an elevation in serum ferritin (27.3 versus 12.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/L</span> in the placebo group) and performed significantly better on a test of verbal learning and memory. </p><p>Similar benefits of iron sufficiency were shown in a blinded placebo-controlled intervention trial in young women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Women aged 18 to 35 years old with iron deficiency performed less well on a series of cognitive tasks than women with sufficient iron stores. After supplementation, an increase in serum ferritin was associated with a five- to sevenfold improvement in cognitive performance.</p><p>In another randomized trial of adolescent girls, improvements in lassitude, the ability to concentrate in school, and mood were reported by the girls who ingested iron compared with the controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In the majority of girls who improved, serum ferritin concentrations were low at baseline and normalized by the end of the study. </p><p>Cross-sectional data regarding iron status from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988-1994) were compared with standardized test scores for 5398 children aged six to 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Three percent of the children in this sample were iron deficient (abnormal values for any two of the following: free transferrin saturation, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and serum ferritin). Compared to children with normal iron status, children with iron deficiency, with and without anemia, had lower average math scores (93.7 versus 86.4 and 87.4 percent for iron deficient children with and without anemia, respectively). Reading, verbal, and performance scores did not differ between the groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical performance and fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) impairs exercise capacity in adolescents; a similar effect as well as easy fatigability may be seen with iron deficiency in the absence of anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In one study, for example, 14 iron-deficient nonanemic adolescent runners were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> (195 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of elemental iron) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The mean ferritin concentration rose from 8.7 to 26.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/L</span> in patients taking iron and fell from 10.6 to 8.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/L</span> in the placebo group. Treadmill endurance times improved significantly in the iron-treated runners (increase of 0.03 to 1.92 minutes) while declining in all seven controls (decrease of 0.07 to 1.30 minutes). No significant differences in gas exchange or cardiac measures occurred between the two groups.</p><p>An observational study in nonanemic iron deficient adolescent girls reported improvement in self-reported fatigue after IV iron supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Placebo-controlled trials will be needed to determine the utility of such an approach for patients with subjective symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pica and pagophagia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pica is the intense craving for nonfood items. Various forms of pica have been associated with iron deficiency, including clay or dirt, rocks, starch, chalk, soap, paper, cardboard, or raw rice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Pagophagia, or pica for ice, is particularly common and quite specific for the iron deficiency state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. It may be present in children who are not anemic and responds rapidly to treatment with iron, often before any increase is noted in the hemoglobin concentration. Children with intellectual disability or autism also may develop pica, which is not consistently associated with iron deficiency in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Beeturia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An occasional manifestation of iron deficiency is beeturia, in which the ingestion of beets leads to the excretion of red urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This finding is caused by increased intestinal absorption and subsequent excretion of the reddish pigment betalain (betanin). Betalain, a redox indicator, is decolorized by ferric ions, which presumably explains the predisposition to beeturia in iron deficiency.

However, there is some disagreement about the utility of universal screening (ie, screening of all adolescents regardless of risk factors) and no specific guidance on the timing or age of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/6,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,24</a>]. In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends assessing risk factors for iron deficiency annually in all adolescents, followed by laboratory screening in those with positive risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/9,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22449346\"><span class=\"h2\">Whom to screen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest the following screening procedures: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factor-based screening: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Review of risk factors for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) at least annually during adolescence, especially for dietary iron intake, heavy menstrual blood loss, or history or symptoms of IDA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115696\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115696 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laboratory screening for any adolescent if any major risk factors are identified. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><strong>AND</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Universal screening for females, on one occasion &ndash; In adolescent females in whom no risk factors are identified, we suggest laboratory screening (regardless of risk factors) at least every five years, starting at age 12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p>These recommendations are consistent with the AAP and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations, except that the AAP does not specifically recommend laboratory screening for females with no risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/9,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,36</a>]. We suggest universal laboratory screening for female adolescents because of the high frequency of iron deficiency in this population (up to 15 percent in the United States), and also because most adolescent females have at least one risk factor (eg, low dietary iron intake, heavy menstrual blood loss, or underweight). In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of risk factor-based screening in adolescent girls is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22449531\"><span class=\"h2\">How to screen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To screen for iron deficiency, we suggest measuring a complete blood count (CBC) at a minimum. We also suggest simultaneous measurement of serum ferritin, if possible, especially for patients with a high risk for iron deficiency. </p><p>Although measurement of hemoglobin alone is sufficient to diagnose anemia (defined as a hemoglobin level of &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for girls, or &lt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for boys) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], anemia is neither a sensitive nor a specific screen for iron deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Therefore, screening with a CBC is preferred because it includes red blood cell indices such as mean corpuscular volume and red blood cell distribution width (RDW; a measure of variability in red cell size), which help to evaluate for iron deficiency. In our practice, we also measure serum ferritin at the time of the initial screen; this result facilitates the diagnosis, and also identifies children who are iron deficient but not yet anemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Iron deficiency is associated with adverse effects, with or without overt symptoms, and should be treated (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below). A low serum ferritin is always consistent with iron deficiency, but normal or elevated ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency. This is because ferritin is an acute phase reactant, and serum levels increase in liver disease, inflammation, and malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82013 \">table 3</a>). Thus, an adolescent with iron deficiency and an acute infection or a chronic inflammatory disease may have a &quot;falsely&quot; normal ferritin concentration.

Patients with these characteristics may benefit from iron supplementation even if they are not anemic, although data in this population are not conclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/40-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-46</a>].

The anemia typically is microcytic and hypochromic, with variable cell size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64267\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64267 \">picture 1</a>) (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] &lt;80, red blood cell distribution width [RDW] &gt;17). If a cause of anemia other than IDA is known or suspected, such as an underlying chronic illness, gastrointestinal blood loss, or a family history of thalassemia, further workup is appropriate before making the presumptive diagnosis of IDA. (See <a href=\"#H622504583\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>The diagnosis of IDA is confirmed by performing a trial of iron supplementation, and demonstrating a rise in serum hemoglobin of &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in follow-up, as described below.

A method to distinguish among these disorders is noted in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65701 \">table 4</a>). Combined nutritional anemias (eg, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency with malabsorption states) also may make it difficult to categorize the anemia using red blood cell indices. All iron tests must be interpreted with the full clinical context and patient history as most measures can be affected by factors other than iron status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82013 \">table 3</a>).

We choose to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a> because it was effective and generally well tolerated in a randomized clinical trial in young children with nutritional IDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. We recommend dosing at the lower end of the recommended range (65 to 130 mg elemental iron) as studies in adults have demonstrated efficacy, improved tolerance, and higher fractional absorption of oral iron in persons treated with relatively low doses of oral iron therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. If other forms of iron therapy are used, the dose should be calculated to provide a similar amount of elemental iron (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106069\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106069 \">table 5</a>). Larger doses rarely are necessary and may produce some degree of intolerance. Additional considerations of absorption and side effects govern the choice of a supplementation regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], as outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Absorption'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Intolerance'</a> below.) </p><p>In adolescents with mild iron deficiency who report poor tolerance of daily iron therapy, it is reasonable to adjust the dosing regimen to every other day or three times per week (eg, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). This strategy is based upon studies in adults with mild iron deficiency in which alternate-day dosing (eg, 60 mg every other day for 28 days) compared with daily dosing (eg, 60 mg daily for 14 consecutive days) improved total iron absorption and reduced side effects such as nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The efficacy of this strategy in individuals with more severe iron deficiency or in younger age groups is unclear and needs further study. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H9253776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Dosing and administration (oral iron)'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>In resource-limited countries, simpler approaches such as the use of iron pots for cooking, might be a useful alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Iron ingots shaped like fish (Lucky Iron Fish) used in cooking water have been studied in low resource settings and have been safe and effective as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Another alternative is the use of weekly rather than daily supplements. In one study of Indonesian adolescents, supplementation with 60 mg of elemental iron (and retinol and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> to increase iron absorption) once weekly was equally efficacious as daily supplementation with the same dose, but better tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Similar results were demonstrated in a population of adolescent Nepalese girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], Indian adolescent girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], and Jordanian children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Reasons that the weekly approach was successful may include improve tolerance, adherence, and higher fractional absorption of iron in persons treated with relatively low doses of iron therapy, based on studies in adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. However, these strategies are based upon relatively low doses of iron (eg, 70 to 100 mg elemental iron once weekly for adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]), which may not be sufficient to treat patients with clinically significant anemia. Therefore, we favor once daily dosing where this is possible, using relatively low doses of elemental iron, as outlined above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Absorption</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron is absorbed best from the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Thus, enteric coated or sustained-release capsules, which release iron further down in the gastrointestinal tract, are counterproductive as well as expensive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron is absorbed as heme iron (from hemoglobin and myoglobin in meat) and nonheme iron (iron salts extracted from plant and dairy foods) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Heme iron is highly bioavailable but comprises a small portion of dietary iron in most diets. Because of lack of heme iron, individuals consuming vegetarian diets may have increased iron requirements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bioavailability of nonheme iron is affected by several intraluminal factors:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Calcium, phytates, and tannates in food impair iron absorption to a variable degree. Phytates are present in legumes, rice, and grains. Thus, optimally, iron supplements are given separately from a meal. Concomitant administration of ascorbic acid can improve iron absorption with or without meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Iron should be given two hours before, or four hours after, ingestion of antacids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Calcium inhibits the absorption of iron by as much as 60 percent. Thus, for individuals with iron deficiency, it is best to optimize absorption by trying to give iron supplements separately from calcium supplements. For individuals without iron deficiency, calcium and iron may be combined in one pill for convenience, as it is likely that there is some adaptation to absorption when supplements are taken regularly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The iron preparation used should be based upon cost and effectiveness with minimal side effects. The least expensive preparation is iron sulfate tablets, which are usually provided in tablets containing 325 mg of iron salts, of which 65 mg is elemental iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron therapy can cause unpleasant gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and constipation. This seems to be related directly to the amount of elemental iron ingested. Placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that low-dose iron supplementation (eg, 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> rarely causes gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

These are dose-related and often can be minimized by altering the supplementation regimen as described above. </p><p>The risk of iron overload during treatment with standard doses of iron supplements is very low in children and adolescents. Patients with juvenile hemochromatosis are at risk for iron overload, but this is a very rare disorder and is effectively ruled out by the presence of a low or normal serum ferritin value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Acute iron intoxication may occur in small children after an accidental overdose, and can be life-threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

Dietary sources of iron are found in meat, grains, fruits, and vegetables. Ready-to-eat, iron-fortified cereal is a major contributor to iron intake among all children and typically provides two to three times more iron per serving than meats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83735 \">table 6</a>). To meet their recommended intake for iron (11 mg for boys, and 15 mg for girls), adolescents typically require two to four servings of iron-rich foods daily, depending on the source. Adolescents who do not meet this requirement through their diet should take a supplement such as a multivitamin with iron. (See <a href=\"#H2835326448\" class=\"local\">'Recommended dietary allowance'</a> above.) </p><p>Heme dietary sources (fish, poultry, and meat) have a higher bioavailability than do non-heme (vegetable) sources (30 versus 10 percent). Thus, iron deficiency may be a particular problem in vegetarian children. In addition, intraluminal factors can affect absorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64874 \">table 7</a>). Ascorbic acid enhances the absorption of non-animal sources of iron such as cereal, breads, fruits, and vegetables, whereas tannates (teas), bran foods rich in phosphates, and phytates (found in seeds and grains) inhibit iron absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/65-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-70</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vegetarian-diets-for-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vegetarian diets for children&quot;, section on 'Iron'</a>.)</p><p>A relatively high calcium concentration also inhibits iron absorption. However, adaptation of iron absorption to high calcium intakes has been demonstrated, suggesting that this should not pose a significant clinical problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H788247830\"><span class=\"h2\">Address etiology of the iron deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many adolescents with IDA or iron deficiency without anemia have additional risk factors other than a low-iron diet. Any adolescent with IDA should be assessed for causes of blood loss; any underlying cause should be treated to ensure appropriate response to iron therapy and prevent recurrence. </p><p>Adolescent girls, in particular, are at risk due to menstrual blood loss. Many young women may have abnormal uterine bleeding during the years immediately post-menarche. This excessive blood loss coupled with rapid growth during adolescence and potentially low or poor-iron diet results in an inability to maintain normal iron stores. Those with heavy menstrual bleeding should have guidance on options available to control bleeding.

This testing should be done when the child is healthy (without signs of a recent illness because a viral illness may cause a transient decrease in hemoglobin). If the hemoglobin has increased by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> if the hemoglobin&nbsp;is &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> at diagnosis), therapy is continued and a CBC is retested every two to three months until the hemoglobin reaches the age-adjusted normal range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101544\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101544 \">table 8</a>).

These results will help to rule out conditions that might mimic or complicate the IDA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65701 \">table 4</a>). Note that hemoglobin electrophoresis results may be falsely negative in a patient with concomitant beta thalassemia trait and iron deficiency.

Nonetheless, IV iron is generally considered second-line therapy for the majority of patients with IDA due to its high cost, as well as potential for adverse effects, although these are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p>Indications for IV iron therapy include persistent anemia with oral iron intolerance, malabsorption, or nonadherence to oral iron therapy despite attempts at family education and support. Children with underlying gastrointestinal disease, such as short bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease, may have particular difficulty tolerating oral iron and require early initiation of IV iron therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Iron'</a>.) </p><p>The IV iron preparations that are most commonly used for treatment of children are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-sucrose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iron sucrose</a> (Venofer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], low molecular weight <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-dextran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iron dextran</a> (INFeD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-carboxymaltose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric carboxymaltose</a> (Injectafer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-requirements-and-iron-deficiency-in-adolescents/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>].

Among adolescent boys, less than 1 percent are iron deficient. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for iron deficiency include chronic illness, heavy menstrual blood loss (&gt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/month),</span> underweight or undernutrition, endurance training, or vegetarian diets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115696\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115696 \">table 1</a>). In addition, girls and boys who are obese are more likely to be iron deficient than their normal-weight peers. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk groups'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for elemental iron is 8 mg in boys and girls age 9 to 13 years, and 11 mg for boys and 15 mg for girls age 14 to 18 years. The value is increased to 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/d</span> for pregnant adolescents. This requirement is appreciably higher than the absorbed iron requirement because of the low rate of absorption of dietary iron. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Iron requirements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laboratory manifestations of iron deficiency occur in several stages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76236 \">table 2</a>), characterized by progressive degrees of anemia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Stages of iron deficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many adolescents with iron deficiency are asymptomatic or have unrecognized, non-specific symptoms, and are identified only by the findings of anemia or low ferritin on laboratory testing. When symptoms arise, they are caused primarily by anemia and include weakness, headache, irritability, and varying degrees of fatigue and exercise intolerance. In addition, iron deficiency can impair cognitive function, concentration, and exercise capacity. Occasionally, iron deficiency may cause pica (particularly of ice). Symptoms often develop gradually and may not be fully appreciated until treatment has been initiated. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening for iron deficiency is an important component of health maintenance during adolescence, and includes (see <a href=\"#H22449346\" class=\"local\">'Whom to screen'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adolescents should be evaluated at least annually for risk factors for iron deficiency, especially for low dietary iron intake, heavy menstrual blood loss, or history of anemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115696\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115696 \">table 1</a>). Laboratory screening should be performed if any major risk factors are identified. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In addition, we suggest universal laboratory screening for girls on at least one occasion during adolescence, rather than screening only for those with risk factors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Laboratory testing should begin starting at age 12, and repeated at least every five years. We advocate this universal laboratory testing because adolescent girls have high rates of iron deficiency anemia (IDA), and a substantial number probably have suboptimal dietary iron intake. More frequent screening should be performed for patients with additional risk factors. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most clinical settings, the simplest and most cost-effective screen for iron deficiency is to perform a complete blood count (CBC), which includes measurements of hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW; a measure of variability in red cell size). For individuals with any of the above risk factors for iron deficiency, it is helpful to measure ferritin as part of the initial screening, to expedite the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H22449531\" class=\"local\">'How to screen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In otherwise healthy adolescents, a presumptive diagnosis of IDA can be made based upon a low hemoglobin concentration (typically &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for nonpregnant adolescent girls and younger boys, or &lt;13 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for boys &gt;15 years), combined with a low serum ferritin (usually defined as less than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/L)</span>. Interpretation of iron measures must account for full clinical context as most of these measures can be affected by factors other than iron status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82013 \">table 3</a>), and to distinguish between IDA and other causes of microcytic anemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65701 \">table 4</a>). In particular, interpretation of serum ferritin is complicated as it is an acute phase reactant, so levels may increase in states of acute or chronic inflammation or in liver disease. A low serum ferritin value is always consistent with iron deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and presumptive diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a presumptive diagnosis of IDA, we suggest a trial of treatment with oral iron supplements, rather than dietary treatment alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest a dose of 65 to 130 mg elemental iron daily, rather than higher doses (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Doses in this range are generally effective and tend to be better tolerated than higher doses of oral iron. Iron supplementation is also appropriate for patients with iron deficiency (low serum ferritin) without anemia. Follow-up monitoring should be performed to ensure response to the supplementation, which also helps to confirm the diagnosis of iron deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Iron supplements'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1069237518\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Steven A Abrams, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">World Health Organization.
