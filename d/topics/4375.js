The likelihood of complication(s) depends on several factors including the infecting pathogen, duration of illness prior to therapy, and underlying comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Complications can occur before, during, and after completion of therapy.</p><p>It can be difficult to assess the true incidence of complications since case series are frequently retrospective. In one review including 223 episodes of IE, 57 percent of patients had one complication, 26 percent had two, 8 percent had three or more, and 6 percent had six or more complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Issues related to complications and outcome of IE will be reviewed here. Indications for surgery and timing of surgery in patients with complications of IE are discussed further separately.

More than one complication can occur simultaneously.</p><p>Complications can also be considered based on pathogenesis (ie, embolic [such as cerebral infarct], local spread of infection [such as heart valve destruction], metastatic infection [such as vertebral osteomyelitis], and immune-mediated damage [such as glomerulonephritis]).</p><p>IE due to <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is associated with complications more frequently than other pathogens (stroke 21 versus 14 percent, systemic emboli 27 versus 18 percent, persistent bacteremia 17 versus 5 percent, and in-hospital mortality 22 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac complications are the most common complications in IE; they occur in up to half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart failure is the most common cause of death due to IE in the modern era. The correlation between heart failure and mortality depends on several factors including the valve involved (aortic valve involvement is more likely to cause heart failure than mitral valve involvement), the pathogen involved (<em>S. aureus</em> infection increases the likelihood of heart failure), and whether the patient undergoes surgery for valve repair or replacement. Heart failure is the most common reason for cardiac surgery in patients with IE; indications for surgery in patients with cardiac complications are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgery-for-left-sided-native-valve-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgery for left-sided native valve infective endocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgery for prosthetic valve endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The usual cause of heart failure in patients with IE is valvular insufficiency resulting from infection-induced valvular damage. Rarely, embolization of fragments of valvular vegetations into the coronary arteries or obstruction of the coronary ostia by vegetation or abscess can cause acute myocardial infarction and subsequent heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Perivalvular abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perivalvular abscess should be suspected in the setting of conduction abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent bacteremia or fever despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The reported incidence of perivalvular abscess among patients with IE is 30 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The aortic valve and its adjacent annulus are more susceptible to abscess formation and associated complications than the mitral valve and annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. This was illustrated in an autopsy study including 95 patients with native valve endocarditis; annular extension of infection was more common in patients with aortic valve compared with mitral valve endocarditis (41 versus 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Perivalvular abscesses can extend into adjacent cardiac conduction tissues, leading to heart block. Involvement of the conducting system is most common in the setting of aortic valve infection, especially when there is involvement of the valve ring between the right and non-coronary cusp; this anatomic site overlies the intraventricular septum that contains the proximal ventricular conduction system. Rarely, perivalvular infection can result in extrinsic coronary compression and can cause acute coronary syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Perivalvular abscess is associated with increased risk of systemic embolization and death. In one study including 73 patients with IE, the embolization rate was approximately twice as high among patients with perivalvular abscess (64 versus 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Another study including 118 patients with IE noted higher mortality among patients with perivalvular abscess (23 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, the presence of moderate or severe regurgitation is associated with higher mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Data are conflicting regarding correlation between vegetation size and risk for perivalvular abscess. Large vegetation size had been implicated as a risk factor for perivalvular abscess in some series, although subsequent studies have shown no correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Patients with IE involving congenital bicuspid aortic valves appear to be more prone to perivalvular complications than those with IE involving tricuspid aortic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Injection drug use may be another risk factor for perivalvular abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more sensitive for detection of myocardial abscess than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one study including 43 patients with perivalvular abscess documented at surgery or autopsy, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of TEE were 87, 95, 91, and 92 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The sensitivity of TTE was much lower (28 percent), although the specificity was 99 percent. While TEE is more sensitive than TTE for detecting abscess, even TEE may miss abscess in difficult imaging situations where calcification, for example of the mitral annulus, obscures perivalvular tissues. Also, abscesses are more difficult to detect before they cavitate, and repeat TEE may be required if suspicion remains high.

Systemic embolization most commonly occurs in left-sided IE; pulmonic embolization most commonly occurs in right-sided IE.

The risk was highest among patients with a vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet (37 percent), suggesting that the mechanical effects of abrupt leaflet excursion may contribute to the risk of embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large vegetation size &ndash; One study including 384 patients with IE noted that vegetation size &gt;10 mm and severe mobility of the vegetation were predictors of new embolic events, even after adjustment for pathogen type.

Acute renal failure, defined as a serum creatinine of &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcmol/L),</span> has been described in up to one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Immune complex-mediated renal disease, commonly associated with IE in the pre-antibiotic era, is now uncommon, especially in patients whose infection is detected and treated early.

However, among patients with moderate to severe heart failure, other studies have noted an association between cardiac surgery and lower mortality rate compared with medical therapy alone.
