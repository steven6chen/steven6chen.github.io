For now all that scientists can say for sure is that people with ongoing medical problems are more likely than healthy people to get depressed. Also, people with depression are more likely than nondepressed people to get certain medical conditions.</p><p>People with medical problems can get depressed because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have physical limitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are afraid they might die or have a health crisis, such as a heart attack</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have to spend a lot of time, energy, and sometimes money managing their illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have pain, trouble breathing, or other symptoms that make it hard to enjoy life</p><p/><p>To make matters worse, having depression makes it hard for people to do the things they need to do to manage their medical conditions. For example, depression can make it hard to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remember to take your medicines or go to your doctor appointments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do physical activities or stay active, which is often recommended for better health and to overcome depression</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1673017077\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I am depressed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depressed people feel down most of the time for at least 2 weeks. They also have at least 1 of these 2 symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They no longer enjoy or care about doing the things they used to like to do.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They feel sad, down, hopeless, or cranky most of the day, almost every day.</p><p/><p>Depression can also make you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose or gain weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep too much or too little</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel tired or like you have no energy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel guilty or like you are worth nothing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forget things or feel confused</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel hopeless and think about death or suicide</p><p/><p>If you think you might be depressed, see your doctor or nurse. Only someone trained in mental health can tell if you are depressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1673017094\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do if I have depression and another medical problem?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For starters, do not assume that being depressed is a normal part of being sick. It's normal to be sad sometimes when you are sick, but depression is more serious and long-lasting than that. If you think you are depressed, mention it to your doctor or nurse, and look into treatment.</p><p>Also, make sure that all your doctors and nurses know about all your health problems, including your depression. That way, they know to keep all of those problems in mind when choosing treatment for you. If you have heart disease and need medicines for depression, for example, the doctor treating your depression will need to choose depression medicines that are safe for people with heart disease.</p><p>Finally, if you are having a hard time dealing with your medical problem or depression, think about joining a support group for people with the same illness. Being part of such a group can help you feel less alone. Plus, it can help you learn skills from other people who have been through what you are going through.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1673017109\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Depression (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for depression (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-you-have-multiple-health-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When you have multiple health problems (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-treatment-options-for-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-treatment-options-for-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression treatment options for children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
