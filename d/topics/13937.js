It also introduces a unique set of potential postoperative complications. These include vasospasm, altered platelet-endothelial cell interactions, and a generalized inflammatory response due to blood contacting the synthetic surfaces of the bypass equipment. The result is low flow in the microcirculation of the heart, brain, and other organs, which may lead to organ dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The postoperative management of patients following cardiac surgery is reviewed here. Preoperative pulmonary assessment and potential complications of coronary artery bypass grafting are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical therapy to prevent complications after coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-noncardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early noncardiac complications of coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine monitoring following cardiac surgery typically includes continuous telemetry, measurement of the arterial blood pressure via an arterial catheter, measurement of the cardiac filling pressures via a pulmonary artery catheter (ie, right heart catheter, Swan Ganz catheter), continuous assessment of the arterial oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry, and continuous measurement of the mixed venous oxygen saturation via an oximetric pulmonary artery catheter. Such monitoring allows instantaneous assessment of cardiopulmonary physiology. The expected postoperative values are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75511\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75511 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Although pulmonary artery catheters are used routinely in most centers, there is a paucity of empirical evidence to support this practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In a trial that randomly assigned 1094 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to receive either a central venous catheter or a pulmonary artery catheter to assist in perioperative management, there were no significant differences in the length of intensive care unit stay, occurrence of postoperative myocardial infarction, in-hospital death, major hemodynamic aberrations, or major noncardiac complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most pulmonary artery catheters are removed within 12 to 24 hours of surgery if significant vasopressor, vasodilator, or inotropic therapy is no longer required.

Measurement of arterial blood gases, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, coagulation parameters, serum electrolytes, and serum creatinine is routinely performed on a daily basis.</p><p>Most experts maintain serum glucose between 140 and 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> during the period following cardiac surgery, since hyperglycemia is associated with worse outcomes in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Hyperglycemia should be avoided. Further details regarding glucose control is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and intensive insulin therapy in critical illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Monitoring following cardiac surgery initially occurs in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, the use of clinical practice guidelines and clinical pathways, combined with improvements in cardiac surgical care, has decreased the length of stay in the intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Many patients are now ready to be transferred to &quot;step-down&quot; units within 24 hours of surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIAC DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poor cardiac function during the early postoperative period is associated with an increased risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is usually suspected when there is unexplained postoperative hypotension, tachycardia, or pulmonary edema. Evaluation of suspected cardiac dysfunction consists of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telemetry &ndash; Assess the patient's continuous telemetry to identify or exclude cardiac dysrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography &ndash; Perform transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography to assess biventricular function, to look for residual or unexpected valvular disease, and to exclude pericardial tamponade.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive hemodynamic assessment via a pulmonary artery catheter &ndash; Use a pulmonary artery catheter to measure cardiopulmonary pressures, evaluate pressure tracings, determine cardiac output via thermodilution or the Fick equation, and calculate the systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances. This information can be used to identify valve dysfunction, detect pericardial tamponade, determine whether pulmonary edema is likely cardiogenic or noncardiogenic, and distinguish whether hypotension is most likely due to cardiac dysfunction, hypovolemia, or vasodilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocardiography &ndash; Obtain a 12-lead electrocardiogram to look for myocardial ischemia and to assess in detail any dysrhythmias noted on telemetry.</p><p/><p>These four tests are likely to identify the cause of cardiac dysfunction. A chest radiograph may be helpful in the rare instances when these tests do not find the cause of cardiac dysfunction, since it can identify non-cardiac causes of cardiac dysfunction.</p><p>The most common causes of cardiac dysfunction following cardiac surgery are mechanical complications, physiologic complications (inadequate preload, excessive afterload, and poor ventricular inotropy), dysrhythmias, and myocardial infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical complications of cardiac surgery are usually detected by echocardiography or invasive hemodynamic assessment. Examples include spasm or occlusion of a coronary artery graft, prosthetic valve paravalvular regurgitation, cardiac tamponade, hematoma, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Treatment of the mechanical complications of cardiac surgery is usually surgical.</p><p>Not all mechanical complications of cardiac surgery involve the heart. Non-cardiac mechanical complications include pneumothorax, hemothorax, and endotracheal tube malposition. These complications can be readily identified on a chest radiograph. Pneumothorax and hemothorax often require tube thoracostomy, while endotracheal tube malposition requires repositioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21471856\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once mechanical complications have been excluded, an initial decision should be made about whether the patient's cardiac dysfunction (ie, low cardiac output) is most likely due to an insufficient stroke volume or heart rate. If it is likely due to diminished stroke volume, then it should be determined whether this is likely due to inadequate left ventricular preload (ie, intravascular hypovolemia), excessive left ventricular afterload (ie, hypertension), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor inotropy (ie, cardiomyopathy). Data from the echocardiogram <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> invasive hemodynamic assessment can be used to inform these judgments. Treatment should be directed at the presumed abnormality, while the underlying cause is sought.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Inadequate preload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best measure of left ventricular preload is the left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV). It can be estimated by echocardiography or certain invasive hemodynamic measures: the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (if a pulmonary artery catheter is in place) or the left atrial pressure (if a left atrial catheter has been placed). These hemodynamic measurements approximate the left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), from which assumptions about the LVEDV can be made.</p><p>Left ventricular preload may be inadequate during the immediate postoperative period because of loss of vasomotor tone, increased capillary permeability, intraoperative and postoperative blood loss, or high urine output due to hypothermia. In addition, left ventricular compliance is frequently reduced following cardiac surgery, producing diastolic dysfunction; a higher LVEDP is required to maintain a given preload in affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The reduced compliance is the result of postischemic injury and &quot;myocardial stunning,&quot; which results in inadequate myocardial diastolic relaxation. As an example, patients with significant left ventricular hypertrophy due to aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy often require pulmonary artery occlusion pressures of 18 to 22 mmHg to maintain an adequate preload to support the cardiac output.</p><p>Inadequate preload should be corrected by administering intravascular volume. Such patients should be monitored closely because many will continue to exhibit signs of cardiac dysfunction even after their preload has been corrected. This suggests that there is coexisting poor inotropy and therapy should be redirected toward the poor inotropy as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Excessive afterload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative hypertension is common; it can cause decreased stroke volume and increased myocardial oxygen demand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The presumed etiology is systemic vasoconstriction, likely related to hypothermia induced during bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The observation that rewarming does not closely correlate with resolution of the hypertension suggests that other factors may also be involved, such as humoral factors provoked by cardiopulmonary bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Consequences of systemic vasoconstriction include tissue hypoxia in the skeletal muscles and secondary metabolic acidosis.</p><p>Patients judged to have excessive afterload should be treated with a vasodilator. Sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> is the vasodilator of choice to reduce excessive vasoconstriction in the immediate postoperative period. The blood pressure must be continuously monitored during therapy because vasoconstriction may improve quickly during rewarming from the hypothermia, leading to hypotension that requires immediate discontinuation of the sodium nitroprusside. Hypotension that persists despite the discontinuation of sodium nitroprusside should be initially treated with intravenous fluids, but may require vasopressors. Such hypotension is more common with normothermic bypass and longer cardiopulmonary bypass times, and less common in patients with diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Some patients will continue to exhibit signs of cardiac dysfunction even after their afterload has been reduced. This suggests there is coexisting poor inotropy and therapy should be redirected toward the poor inotropy as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21471923\"><span class=\"h3\">Poor inotropy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired ventricular function is suggested if the echocardiogram shows poor ventricular contraction and a low ejection fraction, or if the invasive hemodynamic measurements include a low cardiac output accompanied by a normal or high pulmonary artery occlusion pressure and normal or high systemic vascular resistance. Postoperative ventricular function may be decreased due to intraoperative events, postoperative events, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hibernating myocardium. Examples include inadequate myocardial protection during cross-clamping of the aorta, ischemic myocardial injury during off-pump operations, uncorrected valvular lesions, reduced or inadequate intraoperative coronary blood flow, cardiac tamponade, or ischemia or infarction due to coronary artery air embolus, coronary graft vasospasm, or coronary graft thrombosis.</p><p>Patients with poor inotropy due to ischemia, poor inotropy plus inadequate preload, or poor inotropy plus excessive afterload, should initially have their ischemia, inadequate preload, or excessive afterload corrected, respectively. Correction of the ischemia or excessive afterload may improve inotropy, rendering an inotropic agent unnecessary. Correction of the inadequate preload makes it less likely that hypotension will occur if an inotropic agent is started (most inotropic agents cause vasodilation at low doses and, thus, hypotension is common immediately following initiation of the inotropic agent).</p><p>Patients with persistent poor inotropy despite correction of potential underlying causes require pharmacologic inotropic support to augment contractility. The patients who are most likely to benefit from inotropic support are those with a cardiac index less than 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">liters/minute/m2</span> despite an optimized heart rate, rhythm, preload, afterload, and without evidence of tamponade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F99963\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99963 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-vasopressors-and-inotropes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of vasopressors and inotropes&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> is an effective inotrope following cardiac surgery, even though is rarely used as an inotrope in other settings. Epinephrine produces consistent increases in the cardiac output with variable effects on arterial blood pressure following cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dopamine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> also increase cardiac output and heart rate, and appear to have efficacies similar to epinephrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Dobutamine produces greater reduction in left ventricular preload than dopamine and it augments coronary blood flow. However, the importance of the latter phenomenon is unclear, because surgically revascularized patients rarely exhibit ischemia in the absence of mechanical compromise of the coronary circulation.</p><p>Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as inamrinone (formerly known as amrinone), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milrinone</a>, enoximone, and vesnarinone increase myocardial contractility, enhance myocardial relaxation, improve coronary blood flow, and reduce the systemic vascular resistance. The effect is to increase the cardiac index and decrease left ventricular preload and afterload, with minimal change in myocardial oxygen demand. Such agents are probably beneficial when used briefly following cardiac surgery, despite concerns that they may increase mortality when used in chronic heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].Inamrinone is no longer available in North America and <span class=\"nowrap\">most/all</span> other countries so the only intravenous phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor used in the US is milrinone. </p><p>Calcium sensitizing agents have not proven to be beneficial, compared with placebo in the intraoperative or postoperative setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>](See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inotropic-agents-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inotropic agents in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with profound ventricular dysfunction who are unable to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass despite the use of inotropic drugs often require the addition of mechanical assist devices, such as an intraaortic balloon pump or ventricular assist device, until native ventricular function recovers from the stresses of surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass. These devices reduce ventricular wall stress and augment coronary and systemic perfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The trauma of cardiac surgery predisposes patients to atrial and ventricular arrhythmias:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial fibrillation &ndash; Atrial fibrillation can disturb normal atrioventricular synchrony and result in a 15 to 25 percent reduction in cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Initial management involves slowing the ventricular heart rate using negative chronotropic agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>.) The optimal heart rate usually occurs at rates between 80 and 100 beats per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-complications-among-patients-undergoing-cardiac-surgery/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Once the ventricular heart rate is controlled, restoration of sinus rhythm with electrical or pharmacologic cardioversion may be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;</a>.) Postoperative prophylactic therapy with beta blockers or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> can help prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation and may have a role in the management of some patients.

It is usually due to poor distal perfusion after grafting of the more proximal coronary arteries. The incidence of perioperative MI after other types of cardiac surgery is uncertain. It is important for clinicians to realize that the diagnostic accuracy of elevations in the serum creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and troponin is reduced after cardiac surgery because the enzymes are released as a routine sequela of the procedure. The diagnosis and management of perioperative MI are reviewed separately.
