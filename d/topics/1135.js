Pregnancies in SLE patients during periods of high disease activity (particularly nephritis) or with significant disease-related damage (such as pulmonary hypertension and cardiovascular disease) are associated with high maternal morbidity and mortality and poor fetal outcomes. Furthermore, many of the medications used for the management of SLE and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, are contraindicated during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Contraceptive choice varies for patients with SLE and APS, and depends upon clinical history including the presence or absence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL); current disease activity; the patient's age, reproductive history, and desires; and religious and cultural factors.</p><p>Recommendations for individualizing the contraceptive decision for patients with SLE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> APS will be discussed here. Rheumatologists and gynecologists each have specific expertise to contribute toward making the final decision with the patient.

Survey studies examining the likelihood of unintended pregnancy and the use of effective contraception in reproductive-aged sexually active women with SLE have found that almost one-quarter have inconsistent or no use of contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In one of the studies, over one-half of the women using contraception were depending solely on less effective barrier methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Women on teratogenic medications were no more likely than others to use effective contraception.</p><p>The inconsistent use of contraception in SLE patients may partly reflect limited screening, counseling, and gynecology referral by rheumatology clinicians. One prospective study of 178 adolescents from a rheumatology practice evaluated clinician performance of behavioral screening, including screening for sexual activity, and demonstrated low rates of screening by rheumatologists (12.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The major reported barrier to addressing contraception was limited time during the clinic visit. Other factors identified by rheumatologists included logistical issues, their discomfort with the subject area, and ambivalence about their role in behavior screening. Other studies have found that approximately one-half of adult reproductive-aged women with SLE do not receive documented contraceptive counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Additionally, older age, white race, depressive symptoms, and more active disease have been associated with reduced rates of contraceptive counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Another factor that likely contributes to underutilization of contraception amongst women with SLE is that they may be routinely advised to avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives due to concerns regarding risk of disease flare or thrombosis. Estrogen-progestin contraceptives continue to be underused in this population in spite of good data that these methods are safe in SLE patients with stable, mild disease and without the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL).</p><p>Awareness of contraception and reproductive health among women with SLE is increasing. As an example, 1 of 20 published quality indicators for SLE specifically cites the need for patient education regarding potential teratogenicity of medications and the necessity of contraception when starting certain lupus medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandates appropriate patient education regarding necessity of contraceptive use when initiating therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The rheumatologist and gynecologist both contribute to identifying these factors and ultimately making recommendations to the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23808859\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effectiveness of a contraceptive method is expressed as both theoretical or &quot;perfect use&quot; and the actual or &quot;typical use,&quot; with the actual effectiveness typically being lower due to inconsistent or incorrect use. The effectiveness should be taken into account when choosing a contraceptive method. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), which traditionally include intrauterine devices (IUDs) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> implants, are considered the most effective form of contraception (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>). By contrast, barrier methods, which include condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides, have low rates of typical use effectiveness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection#H1700351184\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;, section on 'Contraceptive efficacy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23808820\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of contraceptive agent should take into account the underlying disease activity and severity of SLE. As an example, SLE patients with high disease activity are advised against the use of estrogen-containing contraceptives given the limited data on thromboembolic risk and risk of disease flare in patients with active disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;, section on 'Assessment of disease activity and severity'</a> and <a href=\"#H374833988\" class=\"local\">'Risk of lupus flare'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23808827\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboembolic risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of comorbidities associated with increased risk of thromboembolism are more prevalent in SLE patients, including a history of thrombosis or the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs; eg, lupus anticoagulant [LA], immunoglobulin G [IgG] and IgM anticardiolipin [aCL] antibodies, and IgG and IgM anti-beta2-glycoprotein I [anti-beta-2GPI]), uncontrolled hypertension or other cardiac risk factors, known cardiovascular disease, migraine with aura, stroke, and complicated or longstanding diabetes. Thus, a careful assessment of thromboembolic risk is necessary to exclude patients at greatest risk when using some of the hormonal contraceptive methods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23808866\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interactions of hormonal contraceptives with other medications used to treat SLE may lead to decreased efficacy of either the contraceptive or the alternative medication. Medications commonly used in SLE that have potential interactions with estrogen-containing contraceptives include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, and anticonvulsants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F98707\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98707 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Family planning takes into account achieving good disease control prior to pregnancy, and using the most effective method of contraception particularly for those with severe disease-related damage, high levels of disease activity, or use of teratogenic medications. We also provide patients with guidance regarding effective and safe methods for the given clinical situation, while taking into account their specific values and preferences. Any risk associated with a contraceptive method must be weighed against the risk of unplanned pregnancy for that particular patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus#H158720001\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with systemic lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Preconception evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351624683\"><span class=\"h2\">Our overall approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When helping a woman with SLE and APS initiate contraception, we suggest the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F98708\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98708 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who want to use a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC), the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> (LNg)-containing intrauterine device (IUD) is a safe and effective option for most patients with SLE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). The risk of pelvic infection in patients on immunosuppressive medication is unknown, but an increased risk of infection has not been reported in other immunocompromised patient groups. (See <a href=\"#H201248260\" class=\"local\">'Intrauterine devices'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While other LARCs may also be safe and effective for SLE and patients with aPLs, we prefer the LNg-IUD because it has not been shown to increase thrombosis risk or have a detectable impact on bone density. By contrast, the effect of the etonogestrel-releasing contraceptive implant on bone density and thrombosis risk is uncertain. Another advantage of the LNg-IUD is that it reduces menstrual blood loss, which many women consider a benefit and is particularly helpful for patients on anticoagulation. The copper IUD, on the other hand, may worsen menstrual cramps and may cause heavier bleeding when compared with the LNg-IUD, although most women do not discontinue this IUD because of bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H201248242\" class=\"local\">'Long-acting reversible contraception'</a> below and <a href=\"#H374834000\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic risk and progestin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who want to use an oral hormonal contraceptive, the estrogen-progestin contraceptives may be used in patients with stable low disease activity and documented negative aPLs. Avoiding estrogen-progestin contraceptive methods with higher estrogen exposures than were used in clinical trials (ie, 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol) is suggested to minimize thromboembolic and cardiovascular risk. For the same reason, we also suggest avoiding the transdermal patch as an alternative contraceptive due to the potentially higher estrogen exposure. The vaginal ring is suggested to provide serum estrogen levels comparable to those seen with estrogen-progestin pills, but there are no data on its use in SLE patients. (See <a href=\"#H374833982\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic risk and estrogen'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The data are limited on the safety of estrogen-containing contraceptives in women with high disease activity; thus, alternative methods such as progestin-only contraceptives and IUDs are preferable in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H374833994\" class=\"local\">'Progestin-only contraceptives'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives are contraindicated in women with aPLs with or without SLE, due to the increased risk for thrombosis. The safety of estrogen-progestin contraceptive use in patients with fluctuating aPL titers or positive aPL on anticoagulation is unknown and is not recommended. Also, the use of estrogen-progestin hormonal contraceptives is discouraged in patients with prolonged immobility, such as in the postoperative setting. (See <a href=\"#H374833976\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen-progestin contraceptives'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For SLE patients who do not want to use an IUD and have high disease activity, a positive aPL, or other contraindications to the use of estrogen, we suggest progestin-only contraceptives such as the progestin-only pill. While the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> is likely to be low-risk and effective as well, it is a third-generation progestin and has not been studied in these patients or in other patients with prothrombotic risk factors. Depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), an injectable progestin-only contraceptive, is not a good long-term option for patients with osteoporosis or long-term glucocorticoid use due to risk of decreased bone density. Importantly, progestin-only contraceptives have higher rates of discontinuation due to unscheduled bleeding, so women will need to be counseled about this ahead of time. (See <a href=\"#H374833994\" class=\"local\">'Progestin-only contraceptives'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women taking medications that increase serum potassium or alter renal function (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors), or women with renal insufficiency, require careful monitoring of serum potassium if taking drospirenone-containing oral contraceptives. (See <a href=\"#H374833976\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen-progestin contraceptives'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barrier methods are the least effective contraceptive method, and should be reserved for situations when hormone-containing contraceptives or IUDs must be avoided or are unacceptable to the woman. (See <a href=\"#H16444725\" class=\"local\">'Barrier methods'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The above recommendations differ from those of Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5904a1.htm?s_cid=rr5904a1_e&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsbCRzI0l2D55/Qbax/5ovYdGinn55z0rTqwEHFImyLpfC41tt0teuAMNJLR5EiFU7oWwKl3sDwTgisvKEM+CbiM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=95507\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use (MECC) guidelines</a> in regard to the use of progestin-based contraceptives (eg, LNg-IUD, progestin-only pill, and DMPA) in patients with SLE and positive aPLs. The CDC categorizes the use of all progestin-based contraceptives in patients with positive aPLs as a &quot;3,&quot; which is meant to indicate that the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages (more information can be found in the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/pdf/summary-chart-us-medical-eligibility-criteria_508tagged.pdf&amp;token=jEVGVo6WqsDq698K1C6vDPPjIqTfzg54vW4qWS3doblDMO+X3NN/ro6R0xwK/I6IOwBh6DyNhV/q6vrv3T8nCaRCrZsEC+Wz9FPYFmXFzWEhd9uzeVTKQGeWKf6mT23Z1X5qsRVoFq27I5l+8ZoObQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=10010\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use</a>). By comparison, the authors feel that in some scenarios the progestin-based contraceptives may be used based upon the advantages outlined above, the known risks of unplanned pregnancy in certain SLE patients, and the fact that the increased thromboembolic risk of progestins is largely theoretical with limited clinical data, which is discussed further in detail below.

IUDs available in the United States release either copper or the synthetic progestin LNg. The primary mechanisms of action of both devices prevent fertilization. The copper-containing IUD may be used for at least 10 years and may be associated with heavier menses and dysmenorrhea.</p><p>We prefer the LNg-containing IUD which may remain in place for at least three to five years and significantly reduces dysmenorrhea and menstrual bleeding.

The implant most commonly used in the United States is a single rod subdermal implant that is placed in the inner upper arm and releases etonogestrel (a third-generation progestin) over a three-year period. A LNg (a second-generation progestin) implant is also available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etonogestrel contraceptive implant&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk for thromboembolism with progestin-only contraception is low, and is discussed in further detail below; however, third-generation progestins do have a slightly higher risk of venous thromboembolism than do the second-generation progestins (see <a href=\"#H374834000\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic risk and progestin'</a> below). In addition, safety data on use of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> in patients with APS are not available. Given the slightly greater risk of venous thrombosis associated with third-generation progestins, and the lack of data for use in aPL-positive patients, we prefer use of the LNg-containing IUD over contraceptive implants in aPL-positive women. Progestin-only contraceptives are not associated with an increased risk of SLE flare.

The 19-nortestosterones, also termed second-generation progestins, include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a>, LNg, and others. The third-generation progestins, developed to reduce androgenic side effects, include norgestimate and desogestrel (and its active metabolite etonogestrel).

The potential side effects of progestins differ according to their generation, which is pertinent for evaluation of suitability for SLE patients. All progestins can cause irregular bleeding. Second-generation progestins are associated with more androgenic side effects such as acne, hirsutism, and weight gain than are third-generation progestins; however, third-generation agents are associated with a slightly higher risk of venous thrombosis.

The use of estrogen-progestin hormonal contraceptives is contraindicated in women with aPL with or without SLE due to an increased risk of thrombosis. The safety of use in patients with fluctuating aPL titers or positive aPL on anticoagulation is unknown, and thus their use is not recommended. In addition to the absolute and relative contraindications to the use of oral contraceptives for the general population, a number of comorbidities that present concern for increased cardiovascular risk are more prevalent in SLE patients, including prothrombotic factors (generally aPL) or history of thrombosis, uncontrolled hypertension or other cardiac risk factors, known cardiovascular disease, migraine with aura, stroke, and complicated or longstanding diabetes.

As described above, differences in the type of progestin used in estrogen-progestin hormonal contraceptives account for some variability in venous thrombosis risk among preparations. Third-generation progestins confer greater venous thrombosis risk than do second-generation progestins due to greater activated protein C resistance, while the lowest risk of venous thromboembolism is found in estrogen-progestin contraceptives containing LNg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Other factors such as genetic or acquired thrombophilia, smoking, age over 35 years, and obesity likewise increase the risk of venous thromboembolism in those taking hormonal contraceptives.

A large case-control study evaluating oral contraceptives and risk of arterial thrombosis in the general population found an increased risk for both stroke and myocardial infarction in patients using oral contraceptives, which was further increased in the presence of a positive lupus anticoagulant (LA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The diagnosis of APS is discussed in detail separately, but is generally defined as presence of one clinical and one laboratory criterion. Clinical criteria include thrombosis (arterial, venous, or small vessel thrombosis) and obstetric morbidity (three or more early losses, one or more fetal losses, or delivery prior to 34 weeks due to severe preeclampsia or placental insufficiency). Laboratory criteria include persistent positive LA, moderate-high titer immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody , or moderate-high titer IgG or IgM anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (anti-beta-2GPI) antibody. The risk of thrombosis associated with lower titers of aCL or anti-beta-2GPI is controversial. Thus, we generally avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives in the presence of any positive aPLs.

Although the trial was designed to assess the risk of disease flare, there was no increase in thrombotic complications in the oral contraceptive group versus the placebo group. Some patients in both treatment and placebo groups presumably had low-titer aCLs (not reported). In another trial of SLE patients, treatment with either estrogen-progestin (ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> LNg 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day)</span> or progestin-only (LNg 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> oral contraceptives resulted in similar low rates of thrombosis, 2 of 54 patients per group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-contraception-in-women-with-systemic-lupus-erythematosus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H374833994\" class=\"local\">'Progestin-only contraceptives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women taking medications that increase serum potassium or alter renal function (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors), or women with renal insufficiency, require careful monitoring of serum potassium if taking drospirenone-containing oral contraceptives. (See <a href=\"#H374833976\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen-progestin contraceptives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Barrier methods are the least effective contraceptive method, and should be reserved for situations when hormone-containing contraceptives or IUDs must be avoided or are unacceptable to the woman.

The CDC categorizes the use of all progestin-based contraceptives in patients with positive aPLs as a &quot;3,&quot; which is meant to indicate that the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages (more information can be found in the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/pdf/summary-chart-us-medical-eligibility-criteria_508tagged.pdf&amp;token=jEVGVo6WqsDq698K1C6vDPPjIqTfzg54vW4qWS3doblDMO+X3NN/ro6R0xwK/I6IOwBh6DyNhV/q6vrv3T8nCaRCrZsEC+Wz9FPYFmXFzWEhd9uzeVTKQGeWKf6mT23Z1X5qsRVoFq27I5l+8ZoObQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=10010\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use</a>). By comparison, the authors feel that in some scenarios the progestin-based contraceptives may be used based upon the advantages outlined above, the known risks of unplanned pregnancy in certain SLE patients, and the fact that the increased thromboembolic risk of progestins is largely theoretical with limited clinical data.
