These include prostatodynia (painful prostate) and abacterial prostatitis.</p><p>A classification approach supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to standardize definitions and facilitate research is the accepted categorization of prostate syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This schema defines the following classes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>I &ndash; Acute prostatitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>II &ndash; Chronic bacterial prostatitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IIIA &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS,</span> inflammatory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IIIB &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS,</span> noninflammatory</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV &ndash; Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis</p><p/><p>Acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis (classes I and II, respectively) are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The inflammatory subset of <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> (class IIIA) includes patients with inflammatory cells in expressed prostatic secretions, post-prostate massage urine, or seminal fluid. The noninflammatory <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> (class IIIB) subset includes the remainder of the patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span>. The distinction between inflammatory and noninflammatory <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> is generally for research purposes only, as there is no evidence that patients in the two subgroups have different symptoms or respond differently to therapy.</p><p>In contrast to the symptomatic patient presenting with <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS,</span> asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis (class IV) is typically diagnosed incidentally during prostate biopsy or an infertility or cancer workup. This entity is not sufficiently studied to have an adequate understanding of its natural history, need for therapy, or response to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">prostatitis/chronic</span> pelvic pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(CP/CPPS)</span> is a common condition worldwide, affecting approximately 2 to 10 percent of all adult men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In one United States survey of 58,955 ambulatory visits to clinicians by men over the age of 18 years, genitourinary tract symptoms accounted for 5 percent of all complaints, and prostatitis was listed as a diagnosis in nearly two million encounters annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most men diagnosed with &quot;prostatitis&quot; have <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> rather than acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In a large population-based Canadian study, 10 percent of the men had complaints compatible with <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS,</span> and 7 percent had moderate to severe symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The prevalence seems to peak in the fifth decade but declines thereafter:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>11 percent ages 20 to 39</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>13 percent ages 40 to 49</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10 percent ages 50 to 59</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>9 percent ages 60 to 69</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>7 percent ages 70 to 74</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">prostatitis/chronic</span> pelvic pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(CP/CPPS)</span> is unknown. Despite the use of the term &quot;prostatitis,&quot; it is unclear to what degree the prostate is the source of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Although bacterial infection has been suspected, particularly in the inflammatory subset of <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS,</span> a bacterial etiology has not been consistently identified. Most experts believe that inflammatory and noninflammatory <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> are both noninfectious disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Studies of <em>Chlamydia</em>, <em>Mycoplasma</em>, and <em>Ureaplasma</em>, which have all been implicated in <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS,</span> have generally concluded that they are not responsible for <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Several investigators have performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing looking for evidence of bacteria in prostatic tissues, but these have yielded negative results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. One study cultured prostatic biopsy specimens obtained via the transperineal approach from men with <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> and from normal volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There was no difference in the number of patients from whom bacteria were cultured (38 versus 36 percent, respectively).</p><p>Additionally, there appears to be little relationship between prostatic inflammation on histology and the presence or absence of <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Leukocytes can be found in the prostatic fluid of asymptomatic men, but there is no correlation between the presence of leukocytes and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, in patients who have <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS,</span> chronic but not acute inflammation appears to be associated with a shorter time to symptomatic progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Noninfectious etiologies have been proposed for <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS,</span> but none has been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These include inflammation due to trauma, autoimmunity, reaction to normal prostate flora or some other factor, neurogenic pain, increased prostate tissue pressure, and the interplay of somatic and psychologic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Psychological stress, including anxiety and fear of severe illness, appears to be common in men with symptoms of <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> and may be a contributing factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">prostatitis/chronic</span> pelvic pain syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(CP/CPPS)</span> include pain (in the perineum, lower abdomen, testicles, penis, and with ejaculation), voiding difficulty (including bladder irritation and bladder outlet obstruction). In the NIH-sponsored Multidisciplinary Approach to Pelvic Pain study, 75 percent of men with CPPS had bladder pain or urgency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> may also lead to problems with daily activities, depression, and overall quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> is also associated with erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>There is an association of chronic pelvic pain syndromes with other pain syndromes, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS); chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID); and fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Given the overlapping innervation of the bowel and bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], irritation of the bowel can result in lower abdominal pain and urinary symptoms as well.

The evaluation includes the history, physical examination, urinalysis, urine culture, and, in select cases, diagnostic imaging. Patients suspected of having acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis will frequently receive an empiric trial of an antibiotic (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>), and the diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> will only be entertained in those patients who relapse or do not respond to such therapy.

The NIH developed and validated the Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) which can be useful in the evaluation of patients presenting to general medicine and urology clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The NIH-CPSI specifically assesses pain, voiding, and quality of life. The maximum possible symptom score is 43, where higher numbers indicate more severe symptoms. A modified version of the NIH-CPSI is the Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This adds questions on pain with bladder filling and bladder emptying.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76624028\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The focused examination should evaluate areas of pain, search for unexpected masses, and assess for possible urinary tract abnormalities (including urinary retention).</p><p>The evaluation consists of an examination of the abdomen, including careful palpation of the groin, spermatic cord, epididymis, and testes. Clinicians should specifically search for hernias, testicular masses, and hemorrhoids.</p><p>On digital rectal examination, the prostate is usually not tender but may sometimes be mildly tender; severe tenderness suggests acute prostatitis. In addition to the prostate, the digital rectal examination should also assess for rectal masses and muscle spasm or myofascial tenderness by palpation of the perineum, pelvic floor, and pelvic sidewalls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76624035\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A urinalysis should be performed in any patient suspected of prostatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A urine culture is also required to rule out urinary tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Patients with recurrent urinary tract infections should be evaluated for chronic bacterial prostatitis.

Physical therapy, psychological support, and other treatments are also used in certain cases of <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span>.</p><p>The NIH chronic prostatitis symptoms index (NIH-CPSI) can be used to follow symptoms (ie, pain, voiding, and quality of life) and measure response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H901733\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6553842\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of treatment in clinical practice may vary based on etiology of <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> and specific symptoms (eg, alpha blockers for those with pain and voiding symptoms, antibiotics for those with a history of urinary tract infection). Alpha blockers, antibiotics, and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are the most efficacious medications for treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span>.</p><p>We suggest the use of combination alpha blocker and antibiotic as initial treatment. An alpha blocker (either receptor specific or non-specific) plus a quinolone for six weeks initially is a reasonable option (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamsulosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamsulosin</a> 0.4 mg daily and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> 500 mg twice daily). 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are common treatments for older men with urinary symptoms but are not recommended in young men who are still trying to have children given the effects on semen volume. We also typically reserve 5-alpha reductase inhibitors for <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> for men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of at least 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> which was an entry criterion for the REDUCE trial, discussed below.</p><p>If initial treatment is not effective, patients should be referred to a urologist for further evaluation and management.</p><p>Some clinicians decide to continue initial treatment despite lack of response. It is reasonable to continue an alpha blocker in patients with continued pain and voiding symptoms. Patients should be reevaluated after three months of continued alpha blocker therapy. We suggest not administering further antibiotics if the first course is ineffective and subsequent urine cultures are negative. Several antibiotic classes such as quinolones and tetracyclines (two of the most commonly used antibiotics for <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS)</span> are considered antiinflammatory drugs and may improve symptoms regardless of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-prostatitis-and-chronic-pelvic-pain-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, in the absence of fever and positive urine culture, the patient does not likely have an infection, even if a patient feels better on antibiotics and feels worse the day after stopping them.</p><p>Antiinflammatory medications are generally given when pain is not controlled with initial therapy.

It is the most common diagnosis in men presenting with prostatitis; acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis are less common. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology of <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS</span> is unknown.

Patients should have a physical examination directed at identifying other etiologies of pelvic pain. Any patient suspected of prostatitis should also have a urinalysis and urine culture. Diagnostic imaging is used in selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H334781393\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CP/CPPS,</span> we suggest initial treatment with combination alpha-blocker and antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
