Pneumococcal bacteremia can occur as a result of pneumococcal pneumonia or in its absence. When bacteremia is present, secondary complications, such as arthritis, meningitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endocarditis, may occur.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of pneumococcal bacteremia and selected aspects of other forms of invasive pneumococcal infections, such as meningitis, endocarditis, peritonitis, and various focal infections. The clinical features, epidemiology, and treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia and meningitis as well as vaccination against <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and the microbiology and pathogenesis of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> are discussed separately.

The highest incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease occurs in adults &ge;65 years of age, in children &lt;2 years of age, and in those with certain underlying conditions, such as HIV infection. According to the United States Active Bacterial Core surveillance (ABCs) database of the Emerging Infections Program Network, in 2010 the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in individuals &ge;65 years of age was 36.4 cases per 100,000 population and, in infants &lt;1 year, the incidence was 34.2 cases per 100,000 population, compared with 3.8 cases per 100,000 population in individuals between 18 and 34 years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88701 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, some subgroups have markedly higher risks. For example, in adults aged 18 to 64 years of age with a hematologic malignancy, the incidence was 186 per 100,000 population and, for individuals with HIV infection, the incidence was 173 per 100,000 population in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of childhood vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States declined following the introduction and widespread use of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in children, beginning in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>]. This reduction was due to declines in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in the vaccinated population (children) and in adults presumably due to indirect effects on pneumococcal transmission via herd immunity. However, simultaneous increases in the proportion of cases of pneumococcal infections and nasopharyngeal colonization due to pneumococcal serotypes not included in the PCV7 vaccine (so-called replacement strains) were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>Following the introduction of PCV7, reductions in pneumococcal meningitis and hospitalizations for all-cause pneumonia were observed in both children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In a population-based study in one county in Minnesota, reductions in case-fatality and mortality rates were also observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The largest reductions in case-fatality rates were observed in adults &ge;65 years of age and in patients with invasive pneumonia. Declines in invasive pneumococcal disease have also been reported in Europe. As an example, there was a substantial decline in pneumococcal meningitis among adults in the Netherlands following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the timing and extent of these changes vary in different countries because of differences in immunization policies and herd immunity.</p><p>A <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-conjugate-vaccine-13-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</a> (PCV13) was introduced in the United States in 2010 and replaced PCV7 for universal use in infants and children. United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveillance after the introduction of PCV13 indicates a reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by the serotypes included in PCV13. Compared with the incidence expected among children younger than five years if PCV7 alone had been continued, incidence of IPD overall declined by 64 percent and IPD caused by PCV13 minus PCV7 serotypes declined by 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among adults, incidence of IPD overall declined by 12 to 32 percent and IPD caused by PCV13 minus PCV7 type IPD declined by 58 to 72 percent, depending on age. CDC population-based surveillance from 10 areas of the United States indicates little change in the incidence of IPD caused by nonvaccine serotypes among children younger than five years following the introduction of PCV13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, a 26 percent increase in IPD caused by nonvaccine serotypes among adults ages 50 to 64 suggests serotype replacement.

As an example, data from Active Bacterial Core surveillance areas in the United States indicate that rates of penicillin-nonsusceptible invasive pneumococcal disease among children younger than five years declined by 64 percent between 1998 to 1999 and 2007 to 2008 (ie, before and after the introduction of PCV7, respectively, but before replacement of PCV7 with PCV13 in 2010); similarly, rates of penicillin-nonsusceptible invasive pneumococcal disease among adults &ge;65 years of age declined by 45 percent between these two time periods, suggesting a herd effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>During 2007 to 2008, the six serotypes in PCV13 but not in PCV7 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77274 \">table 2</a>) (almost exclusively serotype 19A) accounted for 97 percent of penicillin-nonsusceptible IPD among children younger than five years, suggesting potential for further decline in rates of penicillin-nonsusceptible IPD with the routine use of PCV13. Surveillance from eight children's hospitals in the United States found a decline in the proportion of isolates nonsusceptible to penicillin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> after the introduction of PCV13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a later study, rates of antibiotic-nonsusceptible IPD caused by serotypes included in PCV13 but not PCV7 decreased between 2009 and 2013 from 4.4 to 1.4 cases per 100,000 in adults aged &ge;65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The magnitude of this effect was addressed in a meta-analysis that evaluated isolates from patients with invasive disease and nasal or nasopharyngeal isolates from asymptomatic children in seven different locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Certain serotypes (eg, serotypes 1, 5, and 7) were up to 60 times more likely to be found in patients with invasive disease than other serotypes (eg, serotypes 3, 6A, and 15) commonly isolated from asymptomatic individuals. In addition, there was a significant inverse correlation between invasive disease and the prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage; the serotypes most commonly isolated from patients with invasive disease were the serotypes least commonly isolated from asymptomatic carriers and vice versa.</p><p>Serotype also may be an important determinant of the severity of pneumococcal meningitis. As an example, in a study of patients with pneumococcal meningitis in Denmark, serotype 1 was associated with a much lower case-fatality rate than serotype 3 (3 versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

There was no association between infection with invasive serotypes 1, 5, and 7 and mortality and no difference in disease severity or mortality between infections caused by vaccine and nonvaccine serotypes.

The test is approved for the diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease using urine samples and, since most patients with pneumococcal meningitis are also bacteremic, it can also be used for the diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis (by testing cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] or urine). The utility of this antigen test in blood culture samples is being evaluated, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of pneumococcal antigen testing of blood culture broth from cultures that were flagged as positive by <span class=\"nowrap\">BactT/ALERT</span> system testing but failed to grow pneumococci by culture, antigen testing improved the yield during one surveillance period, with 43 of 182 samples (24 percent) yielding a positive result; however, during a later surveillance period, antigen testing was positive in only 7 of 221 samples (3.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/invasive-pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-infections-and-bacteremia/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

In addition, 3 of 12 blood cultures that grew <em>S. mitis</em> had false-positive results on pneumococcal antigen testing, which is consistent with other studies that have reported false-positive results in patients with bacteremia caused by viridans group streptococci, particularly members of the <em>S. mitis</em> group.</p><p/><p>Further study of the utility of pneumococcal antigen testing on blood culture samples is necessary. Such testing may be useful for the early detection of pneumococcal bacteremia when a Gram stain is positive and cultures are negative.

The optimal duration of combination therapy is also unknown.</p><p>Until further studies lead to a better understanding of these issues, we, along with most experts, recommend combination therapy (ie, the use of two antibiotics with different anti-pneumococcal mechanisms of action) for patients with known or suspected invasive pneumococcal infections until susceptibility results are available.

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for antibiotic nonsusceptibility'</a> above.)</p><p>The choice of an empiric antibiotic regimen chosen for the treatment of suspected or known invasive pneumococcal infections depends upon local patterns of in vitro pneumococcal resistance.

Routine vaccination in young children caused significant declines in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in children &lt;5 years (the age group targeted for vaccination), older children, and adults. However, an increase in disease caused by pneumococcal serotypes not included in the vaccine (eg, replacement disease) has also been observed.

Pneumococcal meningitis is the most frequent and severe suppurative complication associated with pneumococcal bacteremia. Pneumococcal endocarditis and other suppurative complications of pneumococcal infections, such as pneumococcal arthritis, ileitis, and pericarditis, were much more common in the preantibiotic era. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive diagnosis of pneumococcal bacteremia or invasive pneumococcal infection requires the culture of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> from the blood or another normally sterile site. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Blood cultures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pneumococcal urine antigen test is a rapid immunochromatographic membrane assay that detects the presence of C polysaccharide cell wall antigen common to all serotypes of <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. The test is approved for the diagnosis of invasive pneumococcal disease using urine samples and, since most patients with pneumococcal meningitis are also bacteremic, it can also be used for the diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis (by testing cerebrospinal fluid or urine). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Antigen tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend combination therapy (ie, the use of two antibiotics with different anti-pneumococcal mechanisms of action) for patients with known or suspected invasive pneumococcal infections until susceptibility results are available. The choice of an empiric regimen chosen for the treatment of suspected or known invasive pneumococcal infections depends upon local patterns of resistance. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because concurrent meningitis can often not be definitively excluded at the time of presentation and because the mortality rate is notoriously high during the first 72 hours of treatment, for adults we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously [IV] every 8 to 12 hours if renal function is normal) be given with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (2 g IV every 12 hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotaxime</a> (2 g IV every 4 to 6 hours) for the initial treatment of invasive pneumococcal infection. Combination therapy should normally not exceed three to four days; monotherapy can usually be used after antimicrobial susceptibility results are available. The management of pneumococcal meningitis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Empiric and targeted therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bacterial-meningitis-caused-by-specific-pathogens-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by specific pathogens in adults&quot;, section on 'Streptococcus pneumoniae'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, uncomplicated bacteremia should be treated with a 10- to 14-day course of appropriate antibiotics, assuming the patient has a good therapeutic response. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall mortality rates for patients with pneumococcal bacteremia have consistently ranged from 15 to 20 percent in the antibiotic era. The highest mortality rates are observed in individuals &ge;65 years of age, in those with severe disease, and in immunocompromised hosts.
