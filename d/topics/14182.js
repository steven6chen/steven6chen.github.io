Patients deserve pain relief; adequate relief of pain is a metric of patient satisfaction and may prevent chronic postsurgical pain. However, opioid use for acute pain is associated with increased risk of long-term opioid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], which in turn is associated with death from overdose. The soaring increase in opioid prescriptions in the United States is a driver of the epidemic of drug overdose deaths. This public health epidemic has prompted re-examination and ongoing national debate about the exact best practices for prescribing opioids for acute pain, without complete consensus.</p><p>This topic will discuss the rationale for limitation of opioid prescriptions and will provide a strategy for prescription of opioids for acute pain in opioid na&iuml;ve patients in the outpatient setting. &quot;Opioid na&iuml;ve&quot; is variably defined in the literature. For the purpose of this topic, opioid na&iuml;ve patients are those who have not received opioids in the 30 days prior to the acute event or surgery. Treatment of acute pain for patients chronically using opioids, and for inpatients after surgery, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-pain-in-the-patient-chronically-using-opioids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute pain in the patient chronically using opioids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2829008511\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF LONG-TERM OPIOID USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioids should be prescribed only when necessary, in the lowest effective dose, and for the shortest duration necessary. Taking opioids for acute pain is associated with a greater likelihood of long-term opioid use. Further, a greater amount of initial opioid exposure (ie, higher total dose, longer duration prescription) is associated with greater risks of long-term use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], misuse, and overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Multiple studies have reported an increased risk of new persistent opioid use after prescription of opioids for acute pain in opioid na&iuml;ve patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. Even patients who undergo relatively minor low-pain surgery are at increased risk of long term opioid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, an insurance database study including 36,177 opioid na&iuml;ve adults who underwent surgery reported similar rates of persistent opioid use after minor and major surgery (5.9 and 6.5 percent), with an incidence of 0.4 percent in a nonoperative control cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Risk factors for persistent opioid use after surgery include preoperative pain; medical comorbidities; depression; a history of drug, alcohol, or tobacco abuse; lower socioeconomic status; and use of benzodiazepines or antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Importantly, postsurgical opioid prescription in opioid na&iuml;ve patients is also associated with an increase in overdose and misuse. In a retrospective database study of 1,015,116 surgical patients who had no history of opioid misuse or ongoing opioid use, 56 percent received postoperative opioids, and misuse (ie, opioid dependence, abuse, or overdose) was identified in 0.6 percent of patients after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The total duration of opioid prescription was the strongest predictor of misuse. Each prescription refill was associated with a 44 percent increase in the rate of misuse, and each additional week of opioid use increased the risk of misuse by 20 percent. </p><p>While the risk of persistent opioid use after surgery is relatively low, and the risk of misuse even lower, the absolute number of patients affected is large because of the huge volume of surgical procedures performed each year. In 2010, approximately 48 million ambulatory surgical procedures were performed in the United States alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Therefore, based on study findings above, as many as 1.6 million patients in the United States could become long-term opioid users each year after ambulatory surgery alone, and as many as 160,000 may develop dependence, abuse, or overdose.</p><p>Opioid misuse is discussed more fully separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescription-drug-misuse-epidemiology-prevention-identification-and-management#H29429864\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management&quot;, section on 'Opioid analgesics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-lethal-opioid-overdose-in-the-community#H544614808\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of lethal opioid overdose in the community&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology of overdose'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescription-drug-misuse-epidemiology-prevention-identification-and-management#H29430000\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescription drug misuse: Epidemiology, prevention, identification, and management&quot;, section on 'Limiting dose and early refills'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817842729\"><span class=\"h1\">EXCESSIVE PRESCRIPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overprescription of opioids results in leftover pills, which are then available for diversion and inappropriate use. Among those who abuse opioids, over 70 percent obtain opioids through diversion, and 40 to 50 percent receive the drug from family members or friends who have leftover pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. </p><p>Multiple studies have shown that excessive opioid medications are routinely prescribed for all types of surgical procedures, as well as after emergency department visits for painful conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and most patients save leftover pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/16-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-27</a>]. As a result, large amounts of opioid tablets are available for diversion. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of approximately 210 patients who underwent urologic surgery, 67 percent of patients had surplus medication after discontinuing opioid use, and 91 percent of them saved the pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small survey study reported that 53 percent of patients who underwent cesarean delivery and 45 percent of patients discharged home after thoracic surgery took none or very few (&lt;5 pills) of the opioid prescribed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Only 17 percent of cesarean delivery patients and 29 percent of thoracic surgery patients used all or nearly all of the prescription. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study involving 250 patients who underwent upper extremity surgery reported that most patients received a prescription for 30 opioid tablets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Seventy-seven percent of patients took half or less of the prescribed pills, and 45 percent took less than five. The total number of unused tablets from these 250 patients was 4639.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study of 343 children who were discharged from the hospital with an opioid prescription reported that 58 percent of prescribed doses were not consumed, and only 4 percent of leftover medication was disposed of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Female sex, orthopedic, or Nuss procedures and discharge pain scores <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;5/10</span> significantly predicted higher opioid consumption. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elderly adult patients need and use less opioid for treatment of acute pain than younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/17,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,29</a>]. Because of the risks of central nervous system side effects and possible interactions with other drugs, the doses of opioids prescribed for elderly or frail patients should be reduced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-persistent-pain-in-older-adults#H6632190\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of persistent pain in older adults&quot;, section on 'Choice and dosing of opioid'</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2707511656\"><span class=\"h1\">LEVEL OF PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all acute pain requires treatment with opioids. A major barrier to appropriate dosing of opioid analgesics is that it is difficult to predict the intensity and duration of pain after an injury or surgery. Pain varies depending on the type of injury or surgical procedure; patient demographics; <span class=\"nowrap\">cultural/ethnic</span> factors; prior history of alcohol, drug, or opioid use; and history of anxiety or depression.</p><p>The anatomic location and type of surgery impact the degree of expected postoperative pain. In general, procedures and injuries that involve bones and joints are more painful than those that involve soft tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/17,18,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,30</a>]. A number of studies have examined the degree of pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the quantity of opioid required for pain relief after specific ambulatory surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/16,17,22,23,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,22,23,31,32</a>]. Most are single institution studies, and most do not report the use of non-opioid medications or analgesic techniques (eg, local anesthetic infiltration, peripheral nerve blocks). Thus, applicability to other institutions and patient populations is unclear. Examples of these studies include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study involving approximately 5100 ambulatory surgical patients who received multimodal analgesia (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> premedication, local anesthetic infiltration or regional anesthesia as appropriate) reported that the percent of patients with severe pain at 24 hours varied by the type of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Patients who underwent microdiscectomy were most likely to have severe pain, followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy, shoulder surgery, <span class=\"nowrap\">elbow/hand</span> surgery, ankle procedures, inguinal hernia repair, and knee surgery. Postoperative analgesic prescriptions were not described.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One single center study of 642 opioid na&iuml;ve patients who underwent one of five common outpatient procedures evaluated the number of opioid pills that were taken for postoperative pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The number of pills necessary to supply the opioid needs of 80 percent of patients for each procedure was calculated, with doses converted to equal a 5 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> pill. Results were as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Partial mastectomy: 5 pills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy: 10 pills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: 15 pills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair: 15 pills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Open inguinal hernia repair: 15 pills</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A substantial number of patients who underwent each of the surgical procedures took no opioids postoperatively, ranging from 22 percent after open inguinal hernia repair to 82 percent after partial mastectomy. The use of non-opioid analgesics and other opioid sparing techniques was not described. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a follow-up study this data was disseminated to clinicians, along with a recommendation to direct patients to take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) before opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Re-evaluation of opioid usage led to reducing the recommended prescription for partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy to 5 pills, and only one of the 224 patients analyzed required an opioid prescription refill. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study involving 1400 patients who underwent same day upper extremity surgery reported that patients who had soft tissue procedures took a mean of 5.1 pills before discontinuing opioids, whereas those who underwent fracture related procedures took a mean of 13 pills, and 14.5 pills for joint procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

We avoid the use of codeine because of wide interpatient variability in metabolism to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, and related incidence of adverse events and unreliable analgesia. </p><p>A universal recommendation for the choice and dose of short acting opioid cannot be made, since there are a number of drug and patient factors that must be considered, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient factors</strong> &ndash; Age, ethnicity, gender, hepatic and renal impairment, genetic polymorphisms, and coexisting cardiorespiratory or cerebrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug factors</strong> &ndash; Drug metabolism, strength of receptor binding, the potential for drug-drug interactions, co-administration with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants.</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxycodone</a> may be preferred rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a> for patients who take regularly scheduled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) as part of multimodal pain control, because it is available as a sole drug. In the United States, hydrocodone is only available in combination with acetaminophen or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>. Therefore, the maximum recommended doses of the non-opioid component may complicate and limit administration of hydrocodone when those medications are taken separately. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydromorphone</a> is another frequently used opioid for short-term analgesia, also available as a sole drug, and with clinical duration similar to oxycodone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1623647593\"><span class=\"h2\">Short versus long acting opioid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other professional and governmental organizations which recommend that short acting opioids rather than long acting or extended release opioids, should be used exclusively for treatment of acute pain in opioid na&iuml;ve patients. Immediate release opioids reach peak effect within 45 to 60 minutes, compared with three to four hours for controlled release (ie, slow release or prolonged release) opioids. Thus, rapid titration to effect is safer and easier with immediate release drugs. Unintentional overdose may be more likely if opioid therapy is initiated with long acting opioids. In one cohort study involving initiation of opioid therapy in approximately 840,000 opioid na&iuml;ve patients over 10 years, unintentional overdose in the first two weeks was five times more likely in patients who received long acting opioids, compared with those who took short acting opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1420595303\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose of opioid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical opioid prescription for acute pain consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> 5 mg pills, or the equivalent dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a> (5 mg) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> (50 mg), and such doses appear in most opioid prescribing guidelines. The dose and prescription must be modified based on patient factors. Since it is impossible to precisely predict the response of every patient, a trial methodology calls for careful titration based on watchful observation of effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1392778252\"><span class=\"h2\">Morphine equivalents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of state, federal, and professional guidelines for opioid prescription base the recommended or allowed doses on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> equivalents. However, there are no standard methods for opioid conversion, and available online calculators and published conversion tables provide variable and inconsistent conversion ratios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In addition, there is wide variability among clinicians when converting opioid doses, whether they use printed or online opioid conversion tables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-opioids-for-acute-pain-in-opioid-naive-patients/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Therefore, morphine equivalents should only be used as a general guide for starting doses, with modification based on patient factors, age, prior opioid history, and concomitant drug therapy. It is preferable to underestimate the opioid dose with a watchful approach that includes incremental dose escalation, rather than risking overestimation of dosage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1713000608\"><span class=\"h1\">DURATION OF OPIOID THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opioids should be prescribed in no greater quantity than that required for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. For most painful conditions unrelated to major surgery or trauma, a three day supply should suffice. A reasonable approach for pain after surgery or trauma is to prescribe enough opioid for expected pain or until a follow-up appointment is scheduled. As an example, an opioid-na&iuml;ve patient who is discharged from the emergency department with a long bone fracture might be prescribed enough opioid for the three days (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> 5 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> 2 mg, three to four times per day, 12 pills) until a follow-up appointment with an orthopedic clinician, who would evaluate and then prescribe further treatment for pain if necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3625715919\"><span class=\"h1\">STRATEGY FOR PAIN CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal for acute pain control should not be zero pain, but rather a tolerable level of pain that allows optimal physical and emotional function. Importantly, expectations for pain related to injury, a surgical procedure, or a medical condition, should be discussed with patients and their care providers.
