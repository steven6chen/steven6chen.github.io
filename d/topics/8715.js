The cause of ITP remains unknown in most cases, but it can be triggered by a viral infection or other immunologic or environmental trigger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. ITP was previously known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura or immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The current term <strong>I</strong>mmune <strong>T</strong>hrombocyto<strong>P</strong>enia preserves the widely-recognized acronym &quot;ITP,&quot; while acknowledging the immune-mediated mechanism of the disorder and that patients may have little or no signs of purpura or bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of ITP in children will be reviewed here.

The antibody-coated platelets have a shortened half-life because of accelerated clearance by tissue macrophages, predominantly those in the spleen. In addition, the same antibodies may inhibit platelet production. The net effect is a decrease, often substantial, in the platelet count.</p><p>In some patients with ITP, whether or not antibodies are demonstrable, an alternative immunologic mechanism of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity may cause thrombocytopenia. These cytotoxic T cells may act upon megakaryocytes in the bone marrow rather than circulating platelets. It is not known how often this occurs, nor whether cytotoxic T cells play a role in the typical patient with ITP, nor whether their primary role involves platelet destruction during passage through the spleen. Mechanisms rupturing self-tolerance appear to be active as well. The pathogenesis of ITP is discussed in greater detail separately.

The annual incidence of ITP is estimated to be between 1 and 6.4 cases per 100,000 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. This figure is probably an underestimate because it is based primarily upon patients that develop symptomatic thrombocytopenia, particularly those who require hospitalization.</p><p>Children with ITP can present at any age, but there is a peak in incidence between two and five years and a smaller peak in adolescence. In a prospective population-based study from the five Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland) between 1998 and 2000, the annual incidence of ITP was 4.8 per 100,000 children younger than 15 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Half of the patients were between one and four years of age and approximately 80 percent were younger than eight years of age.</p><p>In childhood ITP, there is a slight predominance of boys to girls, especially in infants. This was best illustrated in the largest case series of children with ITP from the registry of the Intercontinental Childhood ITP Study Group (ICIS) that included more than 2000 infants and children with an age range between 3 months to 16 years. In infants between 3 and 12 months of age, the male-to-female ratio was 1.7:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The male predominance was minimal in older children, such that the overall male-to-female ratio in this pediatric cohort was 1.2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. By contrast, there is a female predominance of ITP in adolescents and younger adults (eg, 18 to 45 years of age).

More commonly, the child looks and feels well. Thrombocytopenia is occasionally detected incidentally if a complete blood count (CBC) with platelets is performed for another reason (eg, preoperatively or on a routine check-up).</p><p>The characteristic findings in children presenting with ITP are reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Preceding illness or vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 60 percent of children with newly diagnosed ITP have a history of a preceding viral illness within the past month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>There is also a very small increased risk of developing ITP in the six weeks following a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination. MMR-associated ITP is rare, occurring in approximately 2.6 cases per 100,000 doses of vaccine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-mumps-and-rubella-immunization-in-infants-children-and-adolescents#H1276242324\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles, mumps, and rubella immunization in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p>Other early childhood vaccines (other than MMR) do not appear to be associated with increased risk of ITP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There have been case reports of ITP following administration of varicella, hepatitis A, and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccines in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Occasionally, children will have a history of bleeding, stretching back one to six months, during which it appears that the ITP was already active. Other than mucocutaneous bleeding, patients usually appear well. On physical examination, there is no significant enlargement of lymph nodes, liver, or spleen, although the spleen may be mildly enlarged in as many as 10 percent of cases.</p><p>If any of these features are present, including limited splenomegaly, other causes of thrombocytopenia should be carefully considered.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 60 percent of children with ITP have a history of preceding viral illness.

Systemic symptoms (eg, fever, anorexia, bone or joint pain, weight loss, or any other sign or symptom suggestive of an underlying serious illness), exposure to thrombocytopenia-inducing drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73618 \">table 1</a>), prior history of bleeding, and family history of bleeding are all generally absent in children with ITP at onset of their disease. On physical examination, there is no significant enlargement of lymph nodes, liver, or spleen. If any of these features are present, other causes of thrombocytopenia should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H2035460624\" class=\"local\">'Lack of systemic signs and symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2012875923\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding symptoms in children with ITP can range from none or minimal (eg, few petechiae or small bruises) to severe and life-threatening (eg, intracranial hemorrhage [ICH], severe gastrointestinal [GI] bleeding) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F89047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89047 \">table 2</a>). Most patients have signs of cutaneous bleeding (petechiae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71480 \">picture 2</a>), purpura, and ecchymoses). Approximately 40 percent of patients also have mucosal bleeding (involving the nasal passages, oral cavity, and genitourinary and GI tracts). Patients with platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;10,000/microL</span> are more likely to have mucosal bleeding and ICH.

In addition, many experts (including the author of this topic review) routinely measure immunoglobulin levels in children with newly diagnosed ITP. We suggest <strong>not</strong> testing for antibodies to specific platelet glycoproteins (such as glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">Ib/IX)</span>. Any findings that are inconsistent with ITP (eg, abnormal white blood cell count or abnormalities on physical examination or peripheral blood smear) should lead to evaluation for other causes of thrombocytopenia.
