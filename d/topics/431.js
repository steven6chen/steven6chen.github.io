Among the different histologic types of adenocarcinomas, grade 1 and 2 endometrioid uterine cancers have a favorable prognosis and typically present at an early stage. Other histologic types of uterine adenocarcinoma (eg, serous, clear cell) are associated with a poorer prognosis.</p><p>The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) combined staging system is used to designate cancer stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113543 \">table 1</a>). In addition to stage, other pathologic factors are used to assign risk for recurrent or persistent disease into low, intermediate, and high risk.</p><p>Women with high-risk endometrial cancer have a poor prognosis following surgery alone. Therefore, adjuvant treatment is often administered, although the effect of any therapy following surgery on overall survival is unclear.

It should be noted that much of the data for adjuvant treatment in early-stage disease with high-risk histology come from studies of serous cell carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-high-risk-endometrial-cancers/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>] and they are difficult to extrapolate to clear cell carcinomas, which are biologically different.</p><p>Chemotherapy plus vaginal brachytherapy has demonstrated similar outcomes as pelvic RT, but results in an increased risk of toxicity. Pelvic RT as the preferred adjuvant treatment option over chemoradiation is supported by preliminary results from the PORTEC-3 trial, which demonstrated similar outcomes but fewer toxicities with pelvic RT. This trial enrolled women with high-risk stage I disease (grade 3 with deep myometrial invasion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphovascular invasion), stage II or III disease, or tumors with serous or clear cell histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-treatment-of-high-risk-endometrial-cancers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

At a median follow-up of 47 months, preliminary data demonstrated no differences in relapse-free survival (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.74-1.10) or in distant recurrence rates (28 versus 21 percent; HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.0-1.86) for those receiving chemoradiation versus chemotherapy alone, respectively. </p><p>However there were fewer lower vaginal recurrences with the addition of radiation (3 versus 7 percent; HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.16-0.82), and fewer lower pelvic and paraaortic relapses (10 versus 21 percent; 0.43, 95% CI 0.28-0.66). Rates of &ge;grade 3 toxicities were similar between the arms.

Beyond histologic subtype, prognosis is highly dependent on both stage and tumor grade, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H181148990\" class=\"local\">'Stage III/IV disease'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176024414\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-TREATMENT SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of recurrences occur within three years of treatment. Approximately 70 percent of patients develop symptoms at the time of recurrence (eg, vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, cough, weight loss). While post-treatment surveillance protocols may vary by institution, we perform clinical exam (including symptom review, symptom-directed physical exam, and pelvic exam) at three-month intervals for two years, then every six months or annually. Detecting isolated vaginal occurrences early is of particular importance as they may sometimes be cured by radiotherapy, or in patients with prior radiotherapy, surgery. While cancer antigen (CA) 125 is used by some clinicians as part of routine surveillance, there is no high-quality evidence that CA 125 surveillance improves outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-recurrent-or-metastatic-endometrial-cancer#H2110942881\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer&quot;, section on 'Isolated vaginal recurrence'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endometrial-carcinoma#H11157097\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endometrial carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Posttreatment surveillance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176024114\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are classified as having high-risk endometrial cancer if they have stage IB grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma, serous or clear cell adenocarcinoma (any stage), or pathologic stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113543 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H125239170\" class=\"local\">'Definition of high risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The adjuvant treatment approach depends on stage as well as the presence or absence of other features. (See <a href=\"#H1557579361\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with high-risk stage IA carcinoma without myometrial invasion, we suggest either adjuvant vaginal brachytherapy or observation, rather than more aggressive approaches such as pelvic radiation (RT) or chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). A choice between vaginal brachytherapy and observation depends on patient and provider preferences. (See <a href=\"#H4029818264\" class=\"local\">'Early-stage disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with high-risk stage IA carcinoma with myometrial invasion, and for stage IB and II carcinoma, we offer pelvic RT. However, chemotherapy remains a reasonable alternative, but if utilized, we favor the use of six cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> rather than fewer cycles.

Chemoradiation has been shown to decrease the frequency of local recurrences relative to chemotherapy alone (but not recurrence-free survival), and we offer it to those at high risk of local relapse (eg, those with deep invasion or bulky lymphadenopathy). (See <a href=\"#H2916814326\" class=\"local\">'Stage III disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3007002065\" class=\"local\">'Addition of radiation for high risk of local relapse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Management of unresectable disease is discussed elsewhere.
