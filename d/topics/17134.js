Fungi exposure can indeed cause adverse health effects, including infections, hypersensitivity disorders, and <span class=\"nowrap\">toxic/irritant</span> effects from their by-products. Less clearly established are a variety of constitutional symptoms resulting from indoor mold exposure, including fatigue, nausea, cognitive dysfunction, and immune dysfunction, as well as putative syndromes such as &quot;toxic mold syndrome&quot; and &quot;mold-induced immune dysregulation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Although &quot;molds&quot; is not scientifically accurate, it is a commonly used term for fungi. The terms &quot;fungi&quot; and &quot;molds&quot; are used interchangeably in this topic review. DNA-based studies have led to the taxonomic classification of fungi into eight phyla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Most genera of fungi involved in human allergic diseases belong to three phyla, which are <em>Ascomycota</em>, <em>Basidiomycota</em>, and <em>Zygomycota</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Previously, most fungi involved in allergic diseases where placed in the archaic group, <em>Deuteromycetes</em> <em>(Fungi imperfecti)</em>, the asexual stage of fungi.</p><p>Fungi that may be found indoors and outdoors, their proven and unproven health effects, and an approach to evaluating patients with symptoms that may be related to fungi will be discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDOOR FUNGAL EXPOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common species of fungi that can be found in the indoor environment include <em>Cladosporium, Alternaria, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Penicillium, Aspergillus</em>, and others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67631 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The presence of fungal spores indoors typically results from invasion from outdoor sources, and indoor levels of fungus generally reflect the fungal levels occurring outdoors at the same time and place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Outdoor fungi can gain access to the indoors via open windows or transfer on clothing or pets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, under the right conditions of humidity and temperature and in the presence of an adequate food source, fungal spores can proliferate indoors, independent of outdoor levels.</p><p>Although culture is the commonly used method to identify a fungus in the environment, DNA sequencing is an evolving approach. Appearance of a fungus growing on surfaces is not particularly helpful for its identification. As an example, the term &quot;toxic black mold&quot; is applied to <em>Stachybotrys</em>, but other fungi produce dark pigments (melanin), and not all black molds produce mycotoxins.</p><p>Indoor levels of fungal spores are typically less than outdoor levels. In a review of the indoor ambient air of 820 residences of people with no mold-related health complaints, the average indoor levels were 1252 <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/m<sup>3</sup>,</span> as compared with outdoor levels of 1524 <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/m<sup>3</sup>,</span> sampled at the same time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, if an environmental analysis shows an indoor concentration of fungal spores that exceeds a simultaneously measured outdoor level, it suggests indoor fungal contamination as the source.</p><p>Visible mold growth is not a reliable indicator of microbial contamination, and home characteristics (eg, home dampness) only partially explain microbial biomarker levels. In addition, there are no established standards for safe indoor fungi levels or for levels that impart health risks. In the absence of such standards, a practical guide for interpreting reports from inspections or investigations of indoor molds has been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT ARE THE KNOWN HEALTH EFFECTS FROM FUNGAL EXPOSURE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Known health effects from fungal exposure include infection, illness from ingestion of mycotoxins, and various hypersensitivity disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61386\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61386 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of fungi are not pathogenic to immunocompetent humans.

Those most often affected include patients with advanced acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) syndrome, those on immunosuppressant therapy or cancer chemotherapy, neutropenic patients, or patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.

Proteinases produced by fungi may play a key role, and T helper type 2 (Th2) allergic responses are necessary to clear the airway of the fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. While these animal studies are intriguing, much more needs to be learned about these processes in humans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ingestion of mycotoxins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All fungi are capable of producing toxins (mycotoxins), and more than 300 mycotoxins have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The process and regulation of toxin production by fungi are poorly understood and appear to depend upon a number of environmental factors (eg, substrate and moisture levels). In addition, although a toxin-producing fungus may be present in any given environment, its presence alone does not ensure that it is producing or will produce mycotoxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Most of the descriptions of mycotoxicosis in humans are derived from the ingestion of moldy foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Ingestion of rye and millet contaminated with the toxin-producing fungus, <em>Claviceps</em>, can lead to ergotism, which is perhaps the oldest known mycotoxicosis. Ergot is an alkaloid-containing toxin with vasoconstricting properties. Ergotism can be subdivided into convulsive (acute) and gangrenous (chronic) forms. The convulsive form is often accompanied by mania and hallucinations with seizures and death in severe cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The gangrenous form, also known as &quot;Saint Anthony's Fire,&quot; leads to ischemia and necrosis of the extremities.</p><p>Aflatoxins, produced by <em>Aspergillus</em> species, are also of medical significance. Foods for consumption by humans and animal feeds are monitored for aflatoxin contamination as part of standard food safety practices in most developed countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], but contamination of peanut products supplied to developing nations as nutritional supplements has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In addition, chronically high dietary levels of aflatoxins have been implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H146270173\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Aflatoxin'</a>.)</p><p>Other reports of mycotoxicosis in the literature involve ingestions of fumonisins from <em>Fusarium</em>, ochratoxin from <em>Penicillium</em>, and trichothecenes from <em>Fusarium</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>, and <em>Stachybotrys</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Fungus balls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fungi, particularly <em>Aspergillus</em> species, can colonize the paranasal sinuses, lungs, kidneys, or brain and form noninvasive collections of fungal mycelia (or fungus balls). These structures generally form in patients with underlying anatomic abnormalities or previous damage to the affected organ (eg, a pre-existing pulmonary cavitary lesion) and are treated with surgical removal.

IgE-mediated allergy is one type of hypersensitivity reaction. While &quot;allergic disease&quot; is traditionally associated with an adaptive IgE-mediated immune response, increasing evidence suggests that the innate immune system plays an important role, as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Fungal products can initiate innate immune responses via their actions on pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] and through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ICL-2s) also appear to be involved in these processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Inflammation generated by these innate responses may account for a lack of correlation between the presence of IgE antibodies to fungal allergens and the presence of symptoms of allergic diseases.</p><p>There are several defined disorders that involve hypersensitivity reactions to fungi, including asthma and allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of sensitivity to fungal allergens in asthma is relatively well-established. A growing body of evidence suggests that sensitization and exposure to outdoor fungi, particularly <em>Alternaria</em>, are associated with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. However, a direct causal relationship between outdoor fungal exposure and asthmatic symptoms has been more difficult to establish. A pediatric study revealed that asthma symptoms and need for inhaled bronchodilator therapy were correlated with the total outdoor spore count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Interestingly, the spore counts of those fungi to which the children were not skin tested (<em>Basiomycetes and Ascospores</em>), for which skin testing reagents are not available, correlated better with symptoms than the counts of those fungi to which the children had positive skin tests (<em>Deuteromycetes</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Fungal allergy is also associated with an increased risk of life-threatening and fatal asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Fungal exposure and sensitization appear to play an important role in lower respiratory tract disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In addition, a link between fungi and severe asthma is emerging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The term &quot;severe asthma with fungal sensitization&quot; (SAFS) has been proposed, and a clinical trial of the oral antifungal (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>) demonstrated improvement in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores in 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Clearly, further studies will be needed to establish this treatment for this asthma phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-agents-for-asthma#H1321119106\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational agents for asthma&quot;, section on 'Antifungal agents'</a>.)</p><p>Several studies suggest that exposure to indoor molds and home dampness are related to adverse respiratory health effects (particularly cough and wheezing), especially in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. Often these studies rely on the self-reported presence of visible mold <span class=\"nowrap\">growth/dampness</span> in the home. The potential mechanism(s) of these effects are unknown but may not involve IgE-mediated sensitization.</p><p>Findings regarding the relationship between<strong> indoor</strong> fungal exposure and asthma are conflicting. Some studies suggest that fungal exposure is a risk factor for asthma development. These include one that found that the presence of indoor visible mold growth in the homes of infants was a risk factor for a positive asthma predictive index (API) at age three years, another that found an association between airway hyper-reactivity and exposure to airborne <em>Penicillium</em> species in the home, and a third that found that mold problems in the kitchen and main living area increased the risk for wheezing in early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. In contrast, other studies failed to find associations between various measures of indoor mold exposure and later development of wheezing or asthma in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Several studies have found associations between &quot;dampness&quot; of the indoor environment and asthma symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/34,35,43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35,43-46</a>]. However, indoor dampness promotes the growth of bacteria and dust mites, in addition to fungi, and it is often difficult to determine which factor contributes most to the development of respiratory symptoms. In contrast to the above studies, investigations of settings with extensive water damage and mold growth are ongoing, but a study of American children whose homes were affected by Hurricane Katrina showed that six months after the event, the children's lung function was normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Thus, the impact of damp environments on health is not clear.</p><p><strong>Outdoor</strong> fungal exposure may prove to be more important than indoor exposure. One prospective study found that outdoor fungal exposure, as opposed to indoor fungal exposure, was associated with asthma symptoms in inner city asthmatic children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Another study identified higher exposures to outdoor fungi in the first three months of life as a risk factor for early wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Allergic rhinitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It seems intuitive that IgE-mediated sensitivity to fungal allergens could be a cause of allergic rhinitis, although literature supporting this assertion is sparse.

It has a high moisture requirement and grows optimally at a relative humidity of 93 percent. <em>S. chartarum</em> spores are relatively sticky and not easily aerosolized. The fungus is difficult to culture, as it does not grow well on standard media and does not compete well with other molds or bacteria.</p><p><em>S. chartarum</em> can produce mycotoxins (macrocyclic trichothecenes), but not all strains of <em>S. chartarum </em>do so, and various factors including substrates on which the fungus grows and moisture levels influence mycotoxin production. The concentrations that can be generated and become airborne are controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/1,15,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,58,59</a>].</p><p>Inhalation of fungal toxins and other fungal debris can occur, but it requires the production of an aerosol that contains fungal fragments, such as in an occupational setting. The occupational disorder &quot;pulmonary mycotoxicosis&quot; has been described in workers exposed to large quantities of fungal material while cleaning silos and has been referred to as &quot;silo-unloader's disease&quot; or &quot;grain fever syndrome.&quot; Symptoms include an influenza-like syndrome with cough, dyspnea, chest tightness, fever, chills, headache, malaise, myalgias, facial warmth, and nausea. Illness is typically self-limited, and patients recover without residual lung impairment.</p><p>The condition is more properly referred to as the organic dust toxic syndrome (ODTS), since it has never been shown that mycotoxins are responsible for the development of the disease and because the inhaled dust contains a variety of fungi, bacteria, and organic debris, including endotoxin.

Reports from the American College of Environmental and Occupational Medicine and the Institute of Medicine concluded that the evidence does not support the contention that mycotoxin-related illness occurs via inhalation in nonoccupational settings, and the relationship between inhalation exposure and adverse health effects is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-fungi-molds-in-human-disease/abstract/1,15,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Stachybotrys</em> received a great deal of publicity initially following a geographic cluster of eight cases of acute idiopathic pulmonary hemorrhage (AIPH) that occurred in the inner city of Cleveland, Ohio between January 1993 and November 1994.
