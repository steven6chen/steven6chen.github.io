Fall-related mortality in children has declined since 1987; nonetheless, according to the National Center for Injury and Prevention and Control in 2015, 123 unintentional fall-related deaths occurred in children younger than 20 years: 34 in children younger than five years, 12 in children between 5 and 9 years, 13 in children between 10 and 14 years, and 64 in children between 15 and 19 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Boys were more than three times as likely as girls to die from fall-related injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Emergency department and outpatient surveillance systems indicate that falls are one of the most common injuries requiring medical care and the most common nonfatal injury requiring hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Each year, 2.8 million children are treated in emergency department for fall-related injuries, with children younger than five years of age representing the largest proportion of visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/1,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8-10</a>].</p><p>In the pediatric age group, children younger than five years of age are at the greatest risk of incurring fall-related injury; they are injured at rates higher than any other age group except individuals older than 75 years, who have the highest fall-related injury rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Falls are also the most frequent cause of any injury during infancy (an estimated 35.1 per 1000 infant-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The combination of curiosity, immature motor skills, and lack of judgment renders preschool children particularly susceptible to falling (eg, as they climb on furniture to obtain toys that are out of reach).</p><p>Falls by children occur mainly in the warmer months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The location and mechanism of injuries caused by falls vary depending upon the age of the child. More than 80 percent of fall-related injuries in children younger than four years of age occur in the home; among children aged 5 to 14 years, approximately one-half of the injuries occur at home and one-quarter at school. Infants are at risk for falling from furniture or stairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,16</a>], toddlers are at risk for falling from windows, and older children are at risk for falling from playground equipment.</p><p>Children from low-income families are more likely to be injured from falls due to lack of safety equipment (eg, window guards) or deteriorating housing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Additional predisposing factors for fall injuries identified in case series include history of previous unintentional injury, neurologic disorder (eg, seizures, developmental delay, hyperactivity), documented parental neglect, and acute stressors (eg, recent move, illness, or job change) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FALLS FROM HEIGHT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of fall-related injuries is related to the height of the fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24</a>]. The mortality rate increases from 1 percent for falls from &lt;15 feet to 2.4 percent for falls &gt;15 feet. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The mortality rate for short falls (&lt;1.5 meters in vertical height) for infants and young children is &lt;0.48 deaths per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Head injury, orthopedic injury, and thoracic injury occur more commonly from high-level falls, whereas abdominal injury occurs more commonly from low-level falls in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In children, falls from heights usually occur from windows, balconies, and roofs.

Each year in the United States, approximately eight children younger than five years of age die from injuries related to falls from windows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In addition, an estimated 3300 children younger than five years of age are treated in hospital emergency departments for injuries sustained by falling from windows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]; 45 percent of the injuries are serious (eg, fractures, internal injury, concussion, intracranial hematoma, intracranial hemorrhage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Head injuries and fractures are the most common of the serious injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/20,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,30</a>].</p><p>Fatal injuries related to falls from windows are usually from the second story or higher; the mean height for fatal window-related fall injuries is five to six stories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Serious or life-threatening injuries rarely are sustained in falls from less than 10 feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Thus, many trauma centers use &quot;fall greater than 15 feet&quot; as criteria for transport to a trauma center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. However, this criterion may be a poor predictor of major injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/24,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,34,35</a>], particularly when no unrelated witnesses can corroborate the initial history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Intentional injury should be considered in children with serious injuries from falls that were reported to be less than two stories and in all unwitnessed falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/31,32,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,35,36</a>]. In one series of 61 patients who required hospital admission for falls from at least one story, approximately one-quarter of the falls were intentional: some children jumped to avoid beatings or fires, some were pushed, and some attempted suicide, although other methods of suicide are more common (in 2015, falls accounted for 181 suicides among individuals 12 to 24 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most deaths and hospitalizations related to falls from windows occur during the spring and summer months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/20,22,30,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22,30,39</a>]. One author suggested a possible association between record-breaking temperatures and an increased incidence of pediatric falls from windows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Children at increased risk for falling from windows are boys, younger than five years, and playing unsupervised at the time of the fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/18,30,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,30,41,42</a>]. Children living in apartment buildings are five times more likely to fall from a window than are children living in a house [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Falls from windows occur more often in urban areas with multilevel, low-income, poorly maintained housing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/17,21,39,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,39,43</a>]. The windows usually are in bedrooms or living rooms on the second or third story of apartment buildings or single-family homes; they typically are left open (with just a screen in place) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Furniture often is placed under or near the open window.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Window guards or stops can be used to prevent children from falling through the window opening. The maximum opening should be less than 4 inches because most children younger than six years can slip through a 6-inch opening, and none older than one year can pass through a 4-inch opening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Two years after the introduction of an educational program and the provision of free, easily installed window guards to families with young children living in high-risk areas of New York City, mortality related to falls from windows was reduced by 50 percent (from 108 to 54 deaths per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. No child fell from a window equipped with a window guard. The success of the program in reducing fall-related injury and death persuaded the New York City Department of Health to require landlords to provide window guards in apartments that house children younger than 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Admissions to local hospitals for injuries related to falls from windows decreased by as much as 96 percent after the mandatory program was established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Injury and Poison Prevention has issued a policy statement regarding <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/107/5/1188&amp;token=JVl1rPSYZov4m4VPWoMRYh86VPltPVWCXgiKiYqhqvhLNp53So9wbiCN4oXc03E9ySCsWtOfXs9Phc2vbcTnFw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2857\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">falls from windows, roofs, and balconies</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Recommended strategies to prevent such falls include the installation of window guards or stops on all multistory housing; however, window guards or stops should not be permanently affixed because they may prevent escape in the case of a fire.

Falls from these locations typically occur in older boys. Falls from stairs occur most frequently between the ages of 6 and 11 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/16,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The building codes in many communities require that railings be placed on balconies and fire escapes to prevent a child from passing through them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. National building codes for all newly constructed buildings specify that vertical railing bars must be placed no more than 4 inches apart, and most codes specify railing heights of 36 inches. The retrofitting of older dwellings with railings would help to prevent additional falls from heights. In addition, the provision of safe ground-level playing areas may prevent children from playing in dangerous areas, such as fire escapes and roofs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The use of stair gates in the home may prevent falls from stairs in young children. Meta-analyses have shown safety interventions that provide free or reduced-cost stair gates are effective in increasing stair gate use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">BABY WALKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2008, 3298 children under 24 months of age were treated in emergency departments for injuries associated with baby walkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System of the Consumer Product Safety Commission indicate that emergency department visits by children younger than 15 months for injuries related to baby walkers decreased by 76 percent (from 20,900 to 5100) between 1990 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. It is not clear if this decrease is the result of educational efforts or due to the walker safety standards that were adopted in 1997, or perhaps a combination of both. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>Use of baby walkers is common in households with small children. A survey of more than 1500 parents of children between 3 and 12 months of age in the United Kingdom revealed that 50 percent used baby walkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The use of walkers was associated with other unsafe practices (eg, lack of stair gates). Twelve to 40 percent of infants who use walkers sustain an injury that is related to walker use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/50,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,53</a>], yet nearly 80 percent of these children are supervised at the time of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Most children younger than 15 months of age who sustain injuries related to baby walkers do so by falling down stairs (74 to 96 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/16,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,50,51</a>]. Children in walkers also can be injured if the walker tips over or from pinching of fingers or toes. In addition, walkers may provide increased access to other safety hazards (eg, hot surfaces or containers, pools, poisons) that can cause injury and, rarely, death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/50,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,55,56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individualized educational programs to decrease parental use of walkers have not been evaluated. However, the use of warning labels, stair gates, adult supervision, and public education appear to have little effect on the prevention of injuries related to baby walkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], as illustrated by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one prospective study of 139 infants who were treated for injuries related to baby walkers, 88 percent of the injuries were caused by falls down stairs, yet stair gates were present in one-third of the falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. At follow-up two months after the injury event, two-thirds of the families reported that the child had used the walker since the injury event.

One-third of the families that were contacted approximately two months after the emergency department visit continued to use the walker after the injury event.</p><p/><p>Community-wide educational interventions may be more successful. In one community, a multifaceted intervention addressing the dangers of infant walkers was implemented. After the intervention, there was a 28 percent decrease in the number of children treated in local emergency departments for walker-related falls down stairs compared with the 30 months prior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. However, a causal relationship between the intervention and the decrease in injuries could not be established.</p><p>The lack of efficacy of educational efforts concerning baby walkers prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Injury and Poison Prevention to issue a statement calling for a ban on the manufacture and sale of mobile baby walkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Use of baby walkers should be discouraged; even with supervision, baby walkers remain unsafe because caretakers cannot respond quickly enough to prevent injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">INFANT CARRIERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, in 2013, infant <span class=\"nowrap\">carriers/car</span> seat carriers were associated with 66 percent of injuries in children younger than five years who were treated in emergency departments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-falls-in-children/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Only 15 percent of the children had visible trauma (contusions, minor lacerations); one child had a simple skull fracture, and one had a clavicle fracture; and none of the children had serious, multiple, visceral, or life-threatening injuries.
