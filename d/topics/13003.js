Approximately 80 to 90 percent of bilirubin is produced during the breakdown of hemoglobin from red blood cells or from ineffective erythropoiesis. The remaining 10 to 20 percent is derived from the breakdown of other heme-containing proteins, such as cytochromes and catalase.</p><p>Bilirubin is formed in two steps. The enzyme heme oxygenase (HO), located in the spleen and liver as well as in all nucleated cells, catalyzes the breakdown of heme, resulting in the formation of equimolar quantities of carbon monoxide (CO) and biliverdin. Biliverdin then is converted to bilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase. Measurements of CO production, such as end-tidal CO (ETCO) or carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), both corrected for ambient CO (ETCOc and COHbc, respectively), can be used as indices of in vivo bilirubin production.

Bilirubin dissociates from albumin and is taken up by hepatocytes, where it is processed for excretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conjugation &ndash; In hepatocytes, uridine diphosphogluconurate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) catalyzes the conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid, producing bilirubin diglucuronides and, to a lesser degree, bilirubin monoglucuronides. Conjugated bilirubin, which is more water-soluble than unconjugated bilirubin, is excreted in bile.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary excretion &ndash; Conjugated bilirubin is secreted into the bile in an active process that depends upon canalicular transporters, and then excreted into the digestive tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52393 \">figure 2</a>). Conjugated bilirubin cannot be reabsorbed by the intestinal epithelial cells. It is broken down in the intestine by bacterial enzymes and, in the adult it is reduced to urobilin by bacterial enzymes. But at birth the infant's gut is sterile and, subsequently, infants have far fewer bacteria in the gut, so very little, if any, conjugated bilirubin is reduced to urobilin. Infants have beta-glucuronidase in the intestinal mucosa, which deconjugates the conjugated bilirubin. The unconjugated bilirubin can now be reabsorbed through the intestinal wall and recycled into the circulation, a process known as the &quot;enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin&quot;.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">NEONATAL JAUNDICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpathologic jaundice is caused by normal neonatal changes in bilirubin metabolism resulting in increased bilirubin production, decreased bilirubin clearance, and increased enterohepatic circulation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In term newborn infants, bilirubin production is two to three times higher than in adults. This occurs because newborns have more red blood cells (hematocrit between 50 to 60 percent) and fetal red blood cells have a shorter life span (approximately 85 days) than those in adults. The increased turnover of more red blood cells produces more bilirubin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilirubin clearance is decreased in newborns, mainly due to the deficiency of the enzyme uridine diphosphogluconurate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1). UGT activity in term infants at seven days of age is approximately 1 percent of that of the adult liver and does not reach adult levels until 14 weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-newborn/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increase in the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin, further increasing the bilirubin load in the infant.

These polymorphisms correlate with decreases in UGT1A1 enzyme activity resulting in increased TB levels.</p><p>Another cause of racial variation in the development of neonatal jaundice results from a common mutation in the UGT1A1 gene at Gly71Arg that occurs in Eastern Asians.

It typically presents after the first three to five days of life, peaking within two weeks after birth, and progressively declined to normal levels over 3 to 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-newborn/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Breast milk jaundice needs to be distinguished from breastfeeding failure (suboptimal intake or starvation related) jaundice that occurs within the first seven days of life, resulting in excessive weight and fluid loss. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Breastfeeding failure jaundice'</a> below.)</p><p>In breast milk jaundice, infants commonly have TB levels &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (86 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> for several weeks after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-newborn/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Although the hyperbilirubinemia is generally mild and may not require intervention, it should be monitored to ensure that it remains unconjugated and does not increase. If TB levels begin to increase or there is a significant component of conjugated bilirubin, evaluation for other causes of hyperbilirubinemia should be performed including neonatal cholestasis. If after evaluation, breast milk intake is the only remaining viable factor, breastfeeding can continue with the expectation of resolution by 12 weeks of age and that the hyperbilirubinemia is in the safe zone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-newborn/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Beta-glucuronidase is one proposed substance as it deconjugates intestinal bilirubin, increasing its ability to be absorbed (ie, increasing enterohepatic circulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-newborn/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Approximately 20 to 40 percent of women have high levels of beta-glucuronidase in their breast milk. Blocking the deconjugation of bilirubin through beta-glucuronidase inhibition may provide a mechanism to reduce intestinal absorption of bilirubin in breastfed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-newborn/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Although some studies have found elevated fecal levels of beta-glucuronidase in breastfed infants with hyperbilirubinemia, this has not been a consistent finding.</p><p>Another mechanism that has been proposed is polymorphic mutation of the UGT1A1 gene. In a Japanese study of 170 neonates with breast milk jaundice, half of infants were homozygous for the UGT1A1*6 genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-newborn/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These infants had higher TB than infants with other genotypes. The UGT1A1*6 genotype was not detected in control infants. However, further studies in other areas of the world are needed to determine whether or not there is a causal relationship between genetic variation of the UGT1A1 gene and breast milk jaundice. Thus, currently genetic testing should not be used in the evaluation of breast milk-related jaundice.</p><p>Beta-glucuronidase inhibitors such as enzymatically-hydrolyzed casein or L-aspartic acid, which is contained in casein hydrolysate formula, have been used prophylactically in breastfed newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia-in-the-newborn/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, further studies are needed to determine whether these agents are effective and safe in promoting increased fecal bilirubin excretion, thereby resulting in lower TB. We do not currently recommend these agents for breast milk jaundice.</p><p>Although it is not precisely known if prolonged unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be caused by breast milk intake unmasking an underlying genetic disorder or by casein contained in beta-glucuronidase, the identification of optimal UGT conjugating activity remains a clinical challenge. It therefore may be time to reconsider using the term &ldquo;breast milk jaundice&rdquo; as a clinical disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Intestinal obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ileus or anatomic causes of intestinal obstruction increase the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin and result in jaundice.
