It is usually due to classic diabetic nephropathy, which is characterized by albuminuria and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD; ie, proteinuria, hematuria or decreased glomerular filtration rate [GFR] for three or more months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80632\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80632 \">table 1</a>), irrespective of cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]). In at least one study, the prevalence of microalbuminuria and diabetic nephropathy was nearly identical in pregnant women with type 1 versus type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Albuminuria in women with diabetes is also occasionally due to a glomerular disease other than diabetic nephropathy. </p><p>In women with diabetic kidney disease who become pregnant, the presence of kidney disease raises important questions about the effects of the kidney disease on pregnancy outcome and the effects of pregnancy on risk of progressive kidney dysfunction. The management and outcome of pregnancy complicated by diabetic kidney disease will be reviewed here. General issues pertaining to the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetic kidney disease in nonpregnant individuals are discussed separately, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperglycemia-in-patients-with-type-2-diabetes-and-pre-dialysis-chronic-kidney-disease-or-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes and pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H333243116\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS OF AVAILABLE DATA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many challenges in presenting and interpreting the limited data available on pregnancy in women with diabetic kidney disease, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">definitions/criteria</span> for hypertension, albuminuria, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been modified over time and much of the available data on pregnancy in women with diabetic kidney disease predate these changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is very difficult to make the diagnosis of preeclampsia in patients who enter pregnancy with diabetic nephropathy, including hypertension and &ldquo;significant&rdquo; proteinuria. Escalation of both hypertension and the quantity of protein in the urine is nearly universal in these women in the third trimester, inevitably making the diagnosis of preeclampsia somewhat arbitrary in some or many cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All of the data regarding treatment of hypertension in pregnant women with diabetic nephropathy were reported in uncontrolled case series. Without controls, it is very difficult to separate the effects of degree of blood pressure control from confounding factors associated with the degree of blood pressure control. There are no randomized trials to provide guidance regarding choice of agents or optimal blood pressure targets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There have been many changes in general diabetes care, including strict metabolic control and aggressive prepregnancy treatment of albuminuria and blood pressure, since the 1980s when many of these studies were published. These changes in care may improve prognosis, but the effects of the various interventions are very difficult to separate from one another.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all renal disease among pregnant women with diabetes is exclusively caused by diabetes. The frequency of nondiabetic renal disease depends on many factors, including geographic location, ethnicity, and index of suspicion for performing a kidney biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Kidney biopsies can be performed in pregnancy if there is an abnormal urinary sediment, a sudden change in function, or symptomatic nephrosis before 32 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Normal pregnancy is associated with an up to 60 percent increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) accompanied by a modest decline in serum creatinine, and an increase in albuminuria excretion rate (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Renal and urinary tract physiology&quot;</a>). Similarly, in a study of 30 women with type 1 diabetes, but no kidney disease, albumin excretion rose almost four-fold to 43 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min</span> (equivalent to 62 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In women with diabetic kidney disease, albuminuria also typically increases as pregnancy progresses, and regresses to or near prepregnancy levels after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In a study of 12 women with moderately elevated albumin excretion rates of 30 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours (formerly called microalbuminuria) at baseline, urinary albumin excretion during pregnancy increased almost seven-fold to a mean of 492 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min</span> (equivalent to 708 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> exceeding 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> in four of the women, but returning to baseline in all of the women within 12 weeks after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1169637335\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with kidney disease (estimated GFR below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> or albuminuria), kidney function may decline during pregnancy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-underlying-renal-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with underlying renal disease&quot;, section on 'Effect of pregnancy on kidney disease'</a>). Whether pregnancy causes long-term worsening of diabetic kidney disease or hastens the progression to end-stage kidney disease is controversial.</p><p>In nonpregnant patients with or without diabetes, serum creatinine above 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (132 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and hypertension are the two major risk factors for progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Natural history of renal disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Slowing the rate of progression'</a>.)</p><p>During pregnancy, there is concern that women with CKD who develop decreasing GFR, worsening hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increasing proteinuria may be at risk of accelerated progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This concern is supported by three studies that examined the fall in creatinine clearance in the years following pregnancy and found creatinine clearance decreased at an average rate of 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute/year</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. This rate of decline is substantially higher than the rate of decline (4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute/year)</span> in nonpregnant diabetic patients with nephropathy on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>However, diabetic women with normal albumin excretion or only albuminuria with normal GFR appear to be at less risk for development or progression of kidney disease compared with those who have reduced GFR. In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), a multicenter controlled clinical trial including 190 diabetic women who had 270 pregnancies and 500 diabetic women who did not become pregnant, mean levels of albuminuria and proteinuria over a follow-up period averaging 6.5 years were similar in both groups. Although this study did not enroll patients with evidence of CKD, it suggests that pregnancy did not affect the long-term rate of development of kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study (PCS) also found pregnancy was not a risk factor for progression from normo- to microalbuminuria (ie, progression of albumin excretion rate from 0 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/mm</span> to 20 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">microg/mm)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>However, permanent GFR loss or end-stage kidney disease may develop in women with poorly controlled hypertension or CKD at the onset of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/12,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20</a>]. It appears that some of these women require dialysis or kidney transplantation sooner than if they had not become pregnant. As an example, in a study of 11 women in whom serum creatinine concentrations were &ge;1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (124 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> at the onset of pregnancy, renal function remained stable in 27 percent, transiently worsened in 27 percent, and permanently declined in 45 percent 6 to 57 months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Similar findings have been reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Although the number of women in these studies was small, accelerated decline in kidney function has also been noted in pregnant women with CKD from causes other than diabetes. In one series of 76 women who had an initial mean plasma creatinine concentration of 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (168 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> 10 percent progressed to ESRD during pregnancy or immediately postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The risk of acceleration was highest among those with an initial plasma creatinine concentration above 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> 33 versus 2 percent.

Despite good glycemic control, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of a variety of pregnancy complications, including fetal growth restriction, abnormal antenatal fetal assessment tests (nonreactive nonstress tests, low biophysical profile scores), and preeclampsia. As a consequence, medically- or obstetrically-indicated preterm delivery and cesarean birth are often required.</p><p>In the authors&rsquo; review of the world literature from 1981 to 1996 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73010\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73010 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68924\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68924 \">figure 2</a>), overall perinatal survival in pregnancies complicated by diabetic kidney disease was 95 percent, compared with approximately 99 percent survival in the general obstetric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Preterm delivery occurred in 22 percent of pregnancies and was associated with significant neonatal morbidity (eg, respiratory distress syndrome [20 percent] and jaundice [28 percent]). Fetal growth restriction occurred in 15 percent of pregnancies. The overall congenital malformation rate was 8 percent. Contemporary studies from the past decade have reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. Although data from randomized trials show that tight glycemic control during pregnancy correlated with reduced rates of malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], the clinical impact of this finding has not been substantial because of the challenges in achieving euglycemia prior to conception, which is necessary to impart measurable benefits on malformation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p>The severity of CKD directly correlates with the risk of pregnancy complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/24,31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,31-35</a>], as illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 19 pregnancies in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy, the 11 women with preserved kidney function (ie, normal serum creatinine concentration) had less preterm birth than the 6 women with moderate renal impairment (mean serum creatinine concentration &gt;1.87 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [165 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> (median gestational age at delivery 36 &plusmn; 4 weeks versus 31 &plusmn; 3 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of 45 women with diabetic nephropathy, women with either moderately elevated serum creatinine (&gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [132.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> or proteinuria &gt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/24</span> hours were at increased risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of women with diabetes with normal albumin excretion (albumin excretion rate &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours, n = 203), albumin excretion rate 30 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours (n = 26), and albumin excretion rate &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours (n = 11) reported preterm birth in 35, 62, and 91 percent, respectively; small for gestational age infants in 2, 4, and 45 percent, respectively; and development of preeclampsia in 6, 42, and 64 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p>Preeclampsia is the most frequent complication of pregnancy in women with diabetic kidney disease (in one review, preeclampsia developed in 35 to 66 percent of women with diabetes and kidney disease versus 9 to 24 percent of women with diabetes and no kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]). The risk may be related, in part, to early pregnancy hypertension, level of kidney function, level of proteinuria, or pre-existing vascular damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>In a large series by Coombs, et al evaluating the relationship between early-pregnancy proteinuria and later development of preeclampsia (158 normotensive women and 49 women with chronic hypertension), a receiver-operating characteristic curve showed an increased risk of preeclampsia in women with early-pregnancy proteinuria &ge;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The rates of preeclampsia in women with early-pregnancy proteinuria &lt;190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (group 1), 190 to 499 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (group 2), and &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (group 3) were 7, 31, and 38 percent, respectively. This relationship persisted after adjusting for the effects of parity, chronic hypertension, retinopathy, and glycemic control.</p><p>However, the low risk of preeclampsia in women with a low level of early pregnancy proteinuria was not confirmed by a similar series published by How, et al 11 years later (including 141 normotensive and 52 hypertensive pregestational diabetics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In this series, the rates of preeclampsia in women with early-pregnancy proteinuria of less than 190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (group 1), 190 to 499 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (group 2), and &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (group 3) were 17, 20, and 32 percent, respectively. There was no significant difference in prevalence of preeclampsia between group 1 and group 2 and no threshold that predicted development of preeclampsia. A similar relationship was evident in women with chronic hypertension. The proportion of nulliparous women was similar in groups 1 and 2, but higher in group 3. Glycemic control and presence of retinopathy were not considered in the analysis.</p><p>The low prevalence of preeclampsia in group 1 of the Combs study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] is comparable with that in the nondiabetic population and is difficult to explain. Because neither the Combs study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] nor the How study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] measured urine albumin excretion, it is possible that a higher proportion of group 1 women in the How study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] had albumin excretion rates above normal, which is predictive of development of preeclampsia (see below). The discordance could also relate to differences in patient populations or undefined differences in diagnosis and management that have occurred over the past decade.</p><p>However, in women with prepregnancy hypertension and CKD, it can be difficult to distinguish preeclampsia from the physiological effects of pregnancy on blood pressure and <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/protein</span> excretion, unless preeclampsia has severe features (eg, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1350842828\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with diabetes mellitus should be evaluated preconception for complications of diabetes and glucose control should be assessed. At that time, they should be counseled about the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome (eg, congenital malformations, miscarriage, preeclampsia) and progression of diabetic kidney disease, and interventions to minimize these risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Ideally, pregnancy will be delayed until optimum maternal medical status is achieved.

Therefore, there is no difference in the general approach to treating diabetic kidney disease in patients with or without insulin-dependent disease. The use of insulin in pregnant women with diabetes and reduced renal function (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute)</span> needs to be lower compared with patients with better kidney function because of diminished renal, and even hepatic, metabolism of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

These women should be managed by an expert team including a maternal-fetal medicine specialist, diabetologist, and nephrologist (especially if GFR is decreased or serum creatinine concentration is &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> at pregnancy onset).</p><p>In women with diabetic kidney disease, we suggest a blood pressure goal in line with the American Diabetes Association recommendations for women with diabetes: target blood pressure goals of systolic blood pressure 120 to 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 80 to 105 mmHg during pregnancy, as pressures in this range may benefit long-term maternal kidney function, and are unlikely to impair fetal growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. It is important to note, however, that the treatment goal needs to be individualized, as there are no prospective studies examining blood pressure targets and no data demonstrating that pregnant women with diabetic kidney disease have better outcomes with this blood pressure goal. In a randomized trial of less-tight versus tight control of hypertension in 987 pregnant women with chronic hypertension or gestational <span class=\"nowrap\">hypertension/preeclampsia,</span> tighter control of diastolic blood pressure (target 85 mmHg) decreased the frequency of worsening maternal hypertension compared with less tight diastolic blood pressure (target 100 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. However, there was no difference in primary outcome, which included overall maternal and fetal complications and pregnancy loss, and women with pregestational diabetes or renal disease were excluded.</p><p>We suggest use of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, in women with albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], given these drugs reduce both blood pressure and proteinuria.

Many women with diabetic kidney disease require a combination of therapies to achieve adequate blood pressure control and reduce urine albumin excretion. There are several reasonable options for additional antihypertensive therapy, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyldopa</a>, beta blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, and thiazide diuretics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>]. Methyldopa has been used safely for many years, but is only modestly effective and has sedating effects. Beta blockers are a heterogenous class. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Labetalol</a> does not appear to affect uteroplacental blood flow, and can be given orally or parenterally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]; however, other beta blockers, particularly non-selective beta blockers, have been associated with lower placental and fetal weight when used early in pregnancy, myometrial relaxation, and premature labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>].

Clonidine has a similar mechanism of action to methyldopa. It can be given orally or as a transcutaneous patch; abrupt discontinuation should be avoided, if possible, as rebound increases in blood pressure can occur. Thiazide diuretic use during pregnancy is controversial; volume depletion is unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>], but patients should be monitored for potential changes in serum electrolytes.

Prepregnancy treatment was also associated with favorable perinatal outcomes.

Multiple professional organizations have recommended use of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> prophylaxis for pregnant women at moderate to high risk of developing preeclampsia. A modest reduction in the risk of preeclampsia is possible; however, we believe no prophylaxis is also reasonable, given that experts have been unable to identify a group of pregnant women who will predictably derive a clinically significant benefit from low-dose aspirin therapy and there is no consensus on criteria to define women at moderate to high risk for preeclampsia. These data are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-prevention#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Prevention&quot;, section on 'Low-dose aspirin'</a>.) </p><p>Most of these data included women with various risk factors for preeclampsia. In one of the few trials that included only diabetic women, 462 women with type 1 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive either low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or placebo during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-women-with-diabetic-kidney-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The rate of preeclampsia was similar for the aspirin and the placebo groups (18.7 versus 21.7 percent; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.60-1.25) and there was no difference in the rate of preeclampsia between aspirin and placebo for any of the subgroups in the trial (diabetes with no hypertension or proteinuria, diabetes with proteinuria only, diabetes with hypertension only, diabetes with both hypertension and proteinuria). As discussed above, in women with prepregnancy hypertension and CKD, it can be difficult to distinguish preeclampsia from the physiological effects of pregnancy on blood pressure and <span class=\"nowrap\">albumin/protein</span> excretion, unless preeclampsia has severe features (eg, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, cerebral or visual symptoms).
