The most common form is &quot;cardiac contusion&quot; (ie, injury to the myocardium), which remains the subject of considerable debate. The absence of a clear definition and accepted gold standard for testing makes the diagnosis of cardiac contusion difficult. Important considerations in blunt cardiac trauma include arrhythmia, cardiac wall motion abnormalities, possibly progressing to cardiogenic shock, and rupture of valves, the septum, or a ventricular, atrial, or septal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The evaluation and management of cardiac injuries sustained in adults from blunt thoracic trauma will be reviewed here. Other injuries from blunt trauma and injuries in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-stabilization-of-children-with-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and stabilization of children with thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY, DEFINITIONS, AND SCORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of blunt cardiac injury (BCI) is unknown, and estimates vary widely. Of diagnosed BCIs, &quot;myocardial contusion&quot; or &quot;cardiac contusion&quot; is most common. However, each of these terms has been used to refer to a range of cardiac injuries. The absence of clear diagnostic criteria and reliable diagnostic tests makes reporting difficult. Suggestive symptoms may be unrelated to BCI, while some injuries may be clinically asymptomatic. Furthermore, some criteria used to define significant BCI, such as arrhythmias, may be due to the effects of multiple trauma in a susceptible patient (eg, patient with preexisting heart disease). Other diagnostic criteria, such as an elevated troponin, may be seen in major trauma remote from the chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac biomarkers'</a> below.)</p><p>Due to the ambiguity surrounding the terms &quot;myocardial contusion&quot; and &quot;cardiac contusion&quot;, we prefer to describe BCIs in terms of specific injuries (eg, septal rupture, myocardial infarction) or cardiac dysfunction (eg, diminished contractility in the absence of arrhythmia or hemorrhage). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Types of injury'</a> below.)</p><p>Cardiac rupture is the most devastating BCI. Most patients who sustain rupture of a heart chamber do not reach the emergency department alive. Chamber rupture is described primarily in autopsy series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and mechanism of injury'</a> below.)</p><p>While not widely used in emergency medicine, the cardiac injury scale developed by the American Association for Surgery of Trauma is easy to use, applies to both blunt and penetrating cardiac injuries, and provides a standard scheme for research purposes and documentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75627\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75627 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) occurs most often from motor vehicle collisions (MVC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Falls and crush injuries cause a smaller number. Commotio Cordis, a rare type of BCI in which low impact chest trauma causes sudden cardiac arrest, usually occurs from being struck by a projectile during sports. Arrest appears to stem from the timing of the blow during a period of electrical susceptibility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;, section on 'Commotio cordis'</a>.)</p><p>Rapid deceleration is the mechanism responsible for most BCIs. A direct blow to the precordium also accounts for a sizable number of cases. Any patient involved in a MVC with sudden deceleration, or who sustains significant chest trauma or severe multiple trauma is at risk.</p><p>Several forces may be involved in BCI, including compression of the heart between the spine and sternum, abrupt pressure fluctuations in the chest and abdomen, shearing from rapid deceleration, and blast injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9</a>]. In addition, fragments from rib fractures can directly traumatize the heart.</p><p>The right heart is most commonly injured. This is probably due to its position closest to the anterior chest wall. High pressure ventricular injuries appear to be as common as low pressure atrial injuries, but findings vary based on the type of study (ie, clinical or autopsy). In autopsy series, ventricular injuries predominate. Other pathological findings include valvular tear or rupture, septal tears, and coronary artery thrombosis or laceration, but these are less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prehospital management depends upon patient symptoms and severity of illness. Prehospital providers should treat patients with possible severe cardiac injury according to the principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support&reg;, paying special attention to the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. Rapid transport to the closest trauma center is crucial; interventions causing unnecessary delay must be avoided. A detailed discussion of prehospital trauma care is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diagnosis of blunt cardiac injury (BCI) in the field can be difficult. Trauma patients may have multiple injuries and signs suggestive of BCI, such as arrhythmia, which may stem from hypotension, acidosis, or preexisting heart disease. For patients with minor injuries and no respiratory difficulty, chest pain, or other concerning symptoms, no intervention may be needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of blunt cardiac injury (BCI) can vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Concomitant injuries often affect presentation, and it may be difficult to determine whether symptoms stem primarily from the cardiac injury. Mortality from major structural injuries, such as chamber rupture or perforation, is high and most such patients die in the field. The basic types of BCI are described below; diagnostic approach and management are addressed below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of injury</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myocardial rupture</strong> &ndash; Nonspecific signs and concomitant injuries make clinical diagnosis of myocardial injury difficult. Signs such as hypotension associated with distended neck veins and muffled heart sounds suggest pericardial tamponade (ie, contained myocardial tear or rupture), which may occur with BCI. However, such signs may not be present (eg, patient with hemorrhage and hypotension may not have distended neck veins). Immediate bedside ultrasound may reveal the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiogram'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most patients with severe BCI, such as uncontained myocardial rupture, do not reach the emergency department (ED) alive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Of those who do, hypotension may reduce pressure on the injured myocardium, which may then worsen as fluid resuscitation restores blood pressure. In a minority of patients, rapid diagnosis by echocardiography or CT scan and operative intervention can be lifesaving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Less severe injuries to the ventricular wall may lead to delayed necrosis and manifest as delayed rupture within several days of admission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Atrial rupture occurs far less often than ventricular rupture (most likely due to the location of the atria and their lower compliance) and presentation may be delayed and less acute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Right atrial rupture is seen in about 10 percent of wall ruptures from blunt trauma, and left atrial rupture less often.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Septal and valvular injury</strong> &ndash; Septal injury appears to be rare and its presentation variable. Septal injury may involve insignificant tears or frank rupture, and may occur in isolation or with valvular injury. Findings may include acute valvular insufficiency with widened pulse pressure and signs of acute heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Isolated valvular injury is likewise rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/9,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14,15</a>]. The aortic valve is most often injured, followed by the mitral and tricuspid valves. The lesion may consist of a tear of the leaflet or a partial or full thickness tear of the papillary muscle or chordae tendineae. Presentation may vary, in part depending upon the lesion, but falls somewhere on the spectrum of acute valvular insufficiency with right or left sided heart failure and a new cardiac murmur. A widened pulse pressure may be present with aortic valvular injury. Treatment for septal and valvular injury is generally surgical and timing depends upon the presenting signs and acuity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One retrospective review found a significant increase in tricuspid and aortic valve insufficiency, incompetence, and regurgitation among patients with a history of BCI. Milder cases may go undiagnosed initially and present late with heart failure from long-standing valvular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While less common, mitral valve insufficiency has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myocardial infarction</strong> &ndash; Myocardial infarction (MI) is a rare complication of BCI reported in victims of motor vehicle collisions and minor trauma. Causes include coronary artery dissection, laceration, and thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/20-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-27</a>]. The left anterior descending artery appears to be involved most often [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained early in the evaluation of any patient with significant blunt thoracic trauma to screen for cardiac dysfunction secondary to blunt injury and to rule out the rare MI. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac dysfunction</strong> &ndash; The lack of a clear definition for myocardial contusion is problematic, and we prefer the term cardiac dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology, definitions, and scoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The exact incidence of BCI with cardiac dysfunction (eg, decreased contractility) is unknown. The cause of such dysfunction can be difficult to determine in the multiply injured patient with many reasons for hypotension. An echocardiogram is useful in trauma patients with signs of cardiac dysfunction to diagnose the cause and assist with management. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiogram'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In animal studies, cardiac dysfunction from blunt trauma often manifests multiple hemodynamic derangements unrelated to arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Potential derangements include diminished contractility, decreased cardiac and stroke volume indices, and low mean arterial pressure. Myocardial metabolism may be impaired, as reflected by decreases in oxygen consumption and lactate extraction, and right-sided cardiac pressures may increase. Many of these changes resolve in less than a day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arrhythmia</strong> &ndash; Clinicians should assume that hemorrhage is the cause of tachycardia in the trauma patient until proven otherwise. Once hemorrhage is ruled out, findings such as unexplained, persistent tachycardia, new bundle branch block, and minor arrhythmia (eg, occasional premature ventricular contractions) raise concern for BCI. Patients with any of these findings should be admitted for cardiac monitoring. Case reports describe a wide range of arrhythmias associated with BCI, including supraventricular tachycardia (eg, atrial fibrillation) and ventricular fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Few patients with BCI develop an arrhythmia that requires treatment. While diagnostic criteria vary, making the number difficult to determine, the range often cited is 0 to 5 percent among patients with BCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Criteria may involve elevated cardiac biomarkers, an abnormal ECG or echocardiogram, or some combination of these. Most patients admitted for monitoring manifest minor arrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Concomitant injury and sternal fracture</strong> &ndash; BCI often presents with concomitant injuries. These can include injuries to the head, thorax, abdomen, and spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In one autopsy series, sternal fractures were found in 76 percent of cases involving cardiac injury, but only 18 percent of deaths without BCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A review of a German trauma database reported a substantial risk of BCI among patients with sternal fracture but used a liberal definition of BCI, which may have inflated the number of injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite these reports, a sternal fracture does not necessarily imply the presence of BCI, particularly if the fracture is visible only on CT, and several series report that BCI seldom occurs in cases of isolated sternal fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/37-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-42</a>]. As an example, a large retrospective study looked at patients with chest trauma who were evaluated with both plain chest radiographs and chest CT scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Of the 292 patients with sternal fractures (2 percent of the total study population), 94 percent sustained injuries seen only on CT, seven were diagnosed with a cardiac contusion, and only one required a surgical procedure related to the sternal injury. The presence of a sternal fracture was not associated with increased mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Sternal fracture'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2505321\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2505328\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While blunt cardiac injury (BCI) is often associated with thoracic trauma, it can occur in any patient with multisystem trauma. Initial evaluation proceeds according to standard Advanced Trauma Life Support&reg; protocols, beginning with stabilization of the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should assume that<strong> </strong>hypotension in the trauma patient stems from <strong>hemorrhage</strong>, <strong>not</strong> <strong>cardiac dysfunction</strong>, until proven otherwise. With hypotension in the setting of isolated chest trauma, clinicians should look for pericardial tamponade or a tension pneumothorax in addition to hemorrhage. Evaluation and initial management of the patient with thoracic trauma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic tests</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important screening test for hemodynamically stable patients with potential BCI. An ECG consistent with BCI may reveal persistent sinus tachycardia, another arrhythmia, a new bundle branch block, or ST depressions or elevations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. It can be difficult to determine whether the abnormality is a primary event (eg, an acute coronary syndrome that preceded trauma), a direct result of cardiac injury, or a problem brought on by the physiologic stress of severe trauma.</p><p>One large, retrospective study found that patients diagnosed with BCI have two to four times the baseline risk of arrhythmia, depending upon the patient's age, compared with matched controls who sustain blunt thoracic trauma without BCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Although the study has significant methodologic limitations, it notes the incidence of arrhythmia other than sinus tachycardia (ST) to be &lt;1 percent, and the most common arrhythmia other than ST to be atrial fibrillation. ECG abnormalities, such as ST changes and bundle branch blocks, are not discussed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography can provide important information in the patient who manifests signs consistent with significant BCI, but contributes little to the management of hemodynamically stable patients without arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/8,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,47-49</a>]. We obtain an echocardiogram in any patient with blunt thoracic trauma and unexplained, persistent shock out of proportion to apparent injuries or despite aggressive resuscitation, and in any patient with signs consistent with significant BCI. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p>Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) provides the preferred initial approach for sonographic evaluation. It enables trained clinicians to determine the presence of pericardial effusion and pneumothorax rapidly and accurately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma#H30174462\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Pericardial and limited cardiac examination'</a>.)</p><p>Once pericardial tamponade is ruled out, an echocardiogram is useful in trauma patients with signs of cardiac dysfunction to diagnose the cause of dysfunction, estimate the need for volume resuscitation or inotropic support, and identify other injuries requiring intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/2,8,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,50</a>]. Suggestive signs include abnormal cardiac wall motion and decreased cardiac contractility. Such findings may predate the current trauma in patients with chronic heart disease. Nevertheless, any abnormality should be investigated with a formal comprehensive echocardiogram performed by skilled clinicians to define wall motion abnormalities, identify thrombus, and to identify valvular rupture or dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is superior to transthoracic echocardiography for investigating the cause of persistent hemodynamic instability or other problems thought to be related to BCI. TEE provides a clear view of wall motion abnormalities and valvular and septal injuries. While its benefits are tempered by increased invasiveness, TEE improves sensitivity for injuries that require intervention.</p><p>In one prospective study where patients with &quot;severe chest injuries&quot; underwent both TEE and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), TEE provided optimal images in approximately 98 percent of patients compared with 60 percent for TTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Moreover, multiple serious injuries including wall and valvular ruptures were not visible on TTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The utility of cardiac biomarkers in the setting of BCI remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. There are several reasons for this including the lack of a gold standard for BCI, highly variable clinical outcomes, and the use of different biomarkers. In the rare case of the blunt thoracic trauma patient with evidence of myocardial infarction on ECG, serial biomarkers should be measured and immediate consultation with both cardiology and cardiac surgery obtained.</p><p>The use of cardiac biomarkers may not affect the management of blunt trauma patients with hemodynamic instability or an abnormal ECG that does not demonstrate myocardial infarction. Such patients generally undergo echocardiography and are admitted for further evaluation.</p><p>In one prospective study of 187 patients with blunt chest trauma, an increased troponin at admission or within six hours of arrival correlated with increasing risk of arrhythmia and decreased ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In another prospective study, no adverse outcomes occurred in a subgroup of 16 patients with some initial ECG abnormality but no elevation in troponin at four to six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. According to one review of 10 prospective studies involving 1609 patients admitted to the hospital following blunt chest trauma, a normal high sensitivity troponin using a lower reference limit was associated with a high negative predictive value for clinically significant cardiac complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Of note, the complications, reference levels, and diagnostic criteria were heterogeneous among the included studies. While all these studies are limited, they suggest that troponin measurements may be useful in the patient with ECG abnormalities. However, with a markedly abnormal ECG or complex arrhythmia, it is doubtful a negative troponin provides reassurance that further complications will not occur, and such patients should be admitted for further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/8,53,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,53,57</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p>In the absence of hemodynamic instability, signs of severe injury, or an abnormal ECG, several observational studies suggest that an elevated CK-MB or cardiac troponin is nonspecific for the presence of a clinically significant BCI and has little prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/53,55,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,55,58,59</a>]. Moreover, abnormally elevated troponins occur more frequently among patients with significant nonthoracic trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This latter finding may stem from catecholamine-induced stress, hypovolemic shock with reperfusion injury, oxidative injury, bacterial or viral toxins, or microcirculatory dysfunction.</p><p>For these reasons, we do not routinely obtain cardiac biomarkers in patients without hemodynamic instability, signs of severe injury, or an ECG with significant abnormalities. Concerning ECG abnormalities include arrhythmias other than mild sinus tachycardia, a new conduction block, and ST or T wave abnormalities suggestive of ischemia. In place of biomarkers, we use repeat examinations, serial ECGs, and cardiac monitoring during a brief course of observation (four to six hours) to screen for BCI, if concern exists. The use of biomarkers has not been shown to be more accurate than this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/53,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,59</a>]. While some studies suggest that biomarkers are sensitive indicators of BCI, whether such injuries are significant in patients without clinical signs or symptoms remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In a patient with clinical or ECG findings consistent with BCI, an elevated troponin may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, but the precise threshold is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H972104487\"><span class=\"h3\">Other diagnostic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several observational studies suggest that imaging with CT or MRI can identify areas of contusion on the myocardium in patients suspected of blunt cardiac injury. However, it remains unclear how such findings can inform clinical care, and the use of such imaging should be considered investigational pending further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of the emergency clinician is to rapidly identify and initiate management for any surgically correctable lesion or life-threatening condition, and to identify those patients at risk for blunt cardiac injury (BCI) and initiate appropriate consultation and testing.</p><p>The clinician should perform a standard bedside ultrasound examination (ie, Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma, or FAST). The FAST is an excellent screening test for clinically significant hemopericardium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the FAST is nondiagnostic for hemopericardium, the clinician should obtain bedside echocardiography in any patient with blunt thoracic trauma and unexplained, persistent shock out of proportion to apparent injuries or despite aggressive resuscitation. A formal echocardiogram will better identify wall motion abnormalities and valvular disorders. Identified injuries are managed as described below. Clinicians must remember that hemorrhage remains the primary cause of traumatic shock, and consider other common noncardiac causes of shock (eg, tension pneumothorax). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>An ECG and echocardiography should be obtained for patients with a history or clinical findings consistent with severe BCI. These may include signs of heart failure (eg, pulmonary edema, distended jugular veins) or abnormal heart sounds (eg, muffled sounds, holosystolic or diastolic murmur).</p><p>A screening ECG is obtained in all blunt trauma patients with any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain or tenderness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History suggestive of heart disease (eg, accident preceded by syncope or shortness of breath)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active signs or symptoms consistent with heart disease</p><p/><p>Patients with unexplained tachycardia that persists over several hours despite adequate fluid resuscitation and pain control, a new bundle branch block, or a significant arrhythmia are admitted for cardiac monitoring and likely echocardiography. In the rare case of the blunt thoracic trauma patient with evidence of myocardial infarction on ECG, serial biomarkers should be measured and immediate consultation with both cardiology and cardiac surgery obtained. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p>Other patients without a history or clinical findings consistent with severe cardiac injury, but about whom concern persists, can be evaluated with repeat examinations, ECGs, and cardiac monitoring during a brief course of emergency department (ED) observation (four to six hours). A minimum of two ECGs, obtained toward the beginning and end of the observation period, should be performed.</p><p>While controversy continues regarding the role of biomarkers, we do not routinely obtain a troponin in the stable patient with blunt chest trauma in the absence of significant ECG abnormalities, symptoms suggestive of ischemia, or age &gt;60 years. In the presence of such findings, it is reasonable to obtain a troponin at presentation and four to six hours thereafter.

Due to the ambiguity surrounding these traditional terms, we and many trauma researchers prefer to describe blunt cardiac injuries (BCIs) in terms of specific pathology (eg, septal rupture, myocardial infarction) or cardiac dysfunction (eg, diminished contractility in the absence of arrhythmia or hemorrhage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/1,65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,65-67</a>]. This approach avoids ambiguity and allows clinicians to manage patients based upon discrete problems identified through clinical evaluation and diagnostic testing. Such management is described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Valve, septum, or ventricular wall injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of severe cardiac injury (eg, ruptured valve, septum, or ventricular wall; cardiac tamponade) require emergent surgical consultation.</p><p>Induction agents with cardiodepressive effects and positive pressure ventilation following intubation may further compromise cardiac function in patients with these injuries. If possible (ie, patient is not in acute respiratory distress and is able to protect their airway), it may be helpful to delay intubation until the patient is in the operating room. </p><p>If tamponade is suspected either clinically (eg, hypotension, distended jugular veins, muffled heart sounds) or identified by ultrasound, pericardiocentesis is performed. Tamponade that results from an atrial tear may be amenable to pericardiocentesis with periodic drainage using a pigtail catheter until definitive surgical repair can be performed. </p><p>Among unstable patients who may not survive transfer to an operating room, emergency department (ED) thoracotomy, rather than pericardiocentesis, may be the best treatment for cardiac tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Pericardiocentesis can be an effective temporizing measure, and may be attempted. Nevertheless, in the setting of blunt trauma, ED thoracotomy rarely results in successful resuscitation. ED thoracotomy is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H4933905\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Emergency department thoracotomy (EDT)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-pericardiocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency pericardiocentesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If cardiac injury is suspected in a hypotensive patient and rapid bedside ultrasound is unavailable to exclude tamponade or valvular injury, the cardiac surgery and cardiology services should be consulted immediately.

Thrombolytics are best avoided, unless both bypass surgery and angiography are unavailable. Although there are reports of successful treatment with thrombolytics, severe bleeding complications may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>]. Management should be determined in consultation with cardiology. Cardiac surgery consultation is needed in the rare event that a coronary artery laceration or dissection is identified.</p><p>For patients with features suggestive of BCI and in whom cardiac biomarkers are found to be elevated, cardiology consultation is obtained, and the patient is admitted for cardiac monitoring and further evaluation.</p><p>A screening echocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers do NOT appear to add to the management of the hemodynamically stable patient without historical or clinical features suggestive of significant BCI, and we do not routinely obtain these tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Identified injuries are managed appropriately; patients without identifiable injury but with persistent dysfunction (eg, episodes of hypotension) are admitted for cardiac monitoring. Floor telemetry is appropriate for the patient with minor abnormalities, no significant concomitant injuries, and normal hemodynamics. All other patients should have a higher level of monitoring (eg, cardiac intensive care unit). Cardiology consultation is needed for any patient with hemodynamic instability in whom cardiac injury cannot be excluded.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Arrhythmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No studies have looked specifically at treatment of BCI-related arrhythmia, but most clinicians advocate management using standard ACLS protocols when necessary. In patients with a new arrhythmia (eg, high grade conduction blocks, new onset atrial fibrillation, supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia) following BCI, it is appropriate to perform a bedside echocardiogram to look for wall motion abnormalities or injuries that require emergent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/41,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,73</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p>Clinicians should assume that hemorrhage is the cause of tachycardia in the trauma patient until proven otherwise. Once hemorrhage is ruled out, findings such as unexplained tachycardia that persists over several hours despite adequate fluid resuscitation and pain control, new bundle branch block, or arrhythmia raise concern for BCI. Patients with such findings are admitted for cardiac monitoring and likely echocardiography.</p><p>Cardiology consultation is needed for any patient with a new arrhythmia (including persistent tachycardia), signs of heart failure, or hemodynamic instability likely due to cardiac dysfunction.</p><p>Floor telemetry is appropriate for the patient with minor abnormalities (eg, intermittent premature ventricular or atrial contractions), no significant concomitant injuries, and normal hemodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/41,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,74,75</a>]. All other patients should have a higher level of monitoring. Established criteria for monitoring do not exist, but 24 to 48 hours of monitoring is reasonable for minor abnormalities. Rarely do abnormalities first present after 24 hours. If arrhythmias persist during monitoring, cardiology consultation should be obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3406822\"><span class=\"h1\">PEDIATRIC CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10863031\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reports of blunt cardiac injury (BCI) in children are uncommon, and thus, it is difficult to know the precise incidence or to determine if these injuries occur by different mechanisms than in adults. Motor vehicle collisions (MVC) are routinely cited as the most common cause of BCI in both children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/7,76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,76-78</a>]. As the majority of children are now restrained by seatbelts or car seats and sit in the back seats of cars, MVC may now account for fewer cases of BCI in children.</p><p>BCI occurs in less than 5 percent of children with blunt thoracic trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/76,79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,79,80</a>]. Myocardial contusions account for as much as 95 percent of these injuries; ventricular septal defects and papillary muscle rupture are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. According to a retrospective review, the thoracic and nonthoracic injuries most often associated with BCI in children include pulmonary contusion, rib or clavicle fractures, brain injury, and abdominal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10862825\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation, diagnosis, and management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is difficult to determine if children are more susceptible to blunt cardiac injury (BCI) than adults. However, the chest wall of a child is more compliant than the adult, and therefore during blunt thoracic trauma more kinetic energy can be transmitted to a child's intrathoracic structures without causing bony injury. Thus, BCI in children may go undiagnosed because external examination findings do not reflect the strength of the forces involved. Most BCIs in such cases are cardiac contusions that resolve on their own without any sequela, while most patients with a clinically significant BCI have some abnormal finding on chest examination, chest radiograph, or ECG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-stabilization-of-children-with-thoracic-trauma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and stabilization of children with thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p>Commotio cordis is a type of BCI that occurs with greater frequency in child athletes, most often as the result of a projectile (eg, baseball, hockey puck) striking the chest during a sensitive time during the cardiac cycle. Commotio cordis often results in ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=commotio-cordis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Commotio cordis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unlike adults, children with BCI often have few presenting signs or symptoms so diagnosis may be more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/44,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,81</a>]. The presence of any of the following features in the setting of blunt trauma raises the possibility of clinically significant BCI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An arrhythmia or heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ecchymosis, abrasions, or deformity of the chest wall</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal tenderness over superior ribs, sternum, or scapula</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muffled heart tones or a new murmur</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal upper or lower extremity pulses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rib fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary contusion</p><p/><p>In addition, according to a retrospective review, BCI in children is often associated with pulmonary contusion and rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Signs of heart failure or hypotension in the setting of blunt thoracic trauma may be caused by BCI, but these findings are absent in many children and hypotension is far more likely to be due to hemorrhage. In the same retrospective series cited above, less than 25 percent of children with BCI had an abnormal cardiac examination. Of those with isolated BCI, 26 percent were hypotensive in the emergency department and less than 9 percent had signs of heart failure.</p><p>The diagnostic approach to BCI in children is similar to adults (see <a href=\"#H2505321\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a bedside ultrasound (FAST examination) early in the assessment of any child with blunt thoracic trauma who is hemodynamically unstable. Ultrasound is ideal for identifying hemopericardium. If no hemopericardium is present but there is persistent concern for cardiogenic shock, a formal transthoracic echocardiogram looking for wall motion or <span class=\"nowrap\">valvular/septal</span> abnormalities should be obtained. In younger children, a transthoracic echocardiogram is generally preferred because it is less invasive, less difficult to perform, and usually provides sufficient information. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain a plain chest radiograph for any child with significant chest trauma.

Hemodynamically stable children with a normal sinus rhythm are unlikely to develop an arrhythmia or cardiac insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>As with adults, the appropriate use of cardiac troponin in the evaluation of children with possible BCI remains unclear. BCI is unlikely in an asymptomatic child with a cardiac troponin less than 1.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> at presentation and again within the first six hours of admission (it should be noted that baseline and threshold values for troponin vary by institution and assay) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/55,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,82</a>]. In addition, the clinical significance of an elevated troponin is questionable in a hemodynamically stable child with no examination findings suggestive of BCI and a normal ECG and chest radiograph. Therefore, we do not recommend obtaining a troponin in an asymptomatic child.</p><p>Conversely, any child with an abnormal ECG and elevated troponin following blunt thoracic trauma warrants evaluation with transthoracic echocardiography and admission or close observation, including cardiac monitoring, for at least 24 hours. Troponin may be used as an adjunct in patients who are either clinically symptomatic (eg, arrhythmia, hypotension) or who have abnormal findings on chest radiograph or ECG.</p><p>The general management and disposition of children with blunt thoracic trauma is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-stabilization-of-children-with-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and stabilization of children with thoracic trauma&quot;</a>). In general, any child who has sustained significant blunt chest trauma and manifests any of the findings listed below suggestive of BCI should be admitted for observation, even in the absence of intrathoracic or intraabdominal injuries detected on imaging studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic instability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal ECG findings, including persistent sinus tachycardia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated cardiac troponin in association with concerning symptoms, signs, or abnormalities on ECG or cardiac monitoring</p><p/><p>Definitive management of BCI in children depends upon the specific injury sustained. Cardiac sequelae (such as mitral or tricuspid insufficiency or ventricular septal defect) may develop as the result of BCI. Consequently, all children with confirmed or suspected BCI should have a follow-up evaluation by a cardiologist with pediatric expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10862675\"><span class=\"h1\">PITFALLS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attributing shock in a trauma patient to cardiac injury rather than hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assuming that blunt cardiac injury with hemodynamic abnormalities is due to contused myocardium alone and not obtaining an echocardiogram to look for more severe injury (eg, valvular or septal rupture, pericardial tamponade).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcome for patients with blunt cardiac injury (BCI) correlates with the clinical findings at presentation.

When the diagnosis is made due to an abnormal ECG or cardiac biomarker alone, outcome is favorable, with no long term sequelae in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma/abstract/59,84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,84,85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) is a poorly characterized disease with varied presentations and no clear diagnostic criteria. Injuries may include rupture of the ventricular or atrial wall, septum, or a valve; cardiac dysfunction; arrhythmia; or, rarely, myocardial infarction.

We do not routinely obtain cardiac biomarkers in the stable patient with blunt chest trauma in the absence of ECG abnormalities or symptoms suggestive of ischemia, or unless the patient is 60 years or older. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac biomarkers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chest wall of a child is more compliant than the adult and therefore during blunt thoracic trauma more kinetic energy can be transmitted to a child's intrathoracic structures without bony injury. Thus, BCI can be difficult to diagnose in children because external signs of injury may be minimal or absent. When present, such external signs, focal tenderness over the upper thorax, or abnormal findings on the cardiac or pulse examinations raise the possibility of BCI.
