Blood flows through the aorta to the rest of the body. The &quot;abdominal aorta&quot; is the part of the aorta that is located in the belly and branches to supply blood to the legs. In people with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, also known as an &quot;AAA,&quot; a part of the abdominal aorta balloons out or bulges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52216 \">figure 1</a>). If the bulge bursts, the condition becomes very dangerous. A burst aorta causes lots of internal bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20386062\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an AAA?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with abdominal AAAs have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the belly or back</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small lump in the upper part of the belly that pulses, meaning it swells and shrinks in rhythm with the heartbeat (doctors notice this more often than patients do)</p><p/><p>AAAs can burst with no warning. Doctors suggest you get tested if there is a high risk that you might have the condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20386069\"><span class=\"h1\">Who is most likely to get an AAA?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your risk for having an AAA goes up if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are a man</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are older than 60 (with every year of life after that, your risk goes up even more)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are white</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have family members who have had the condition</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20386076\"><span class=\"h1\">Can AAAs be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. But you can greatly reduce your risk by not smoking. If you have high blood pressure, it is also important to control your blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20386083\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for AAAs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The most common test is called an &quot;abdominal ultrasound.&quot; For this test, your doctor will pass a tool called a &quot;probe&quot; over your belly. The probe uses sound waves to make a picture of your aorta. The picture can show if you have an AAA or some other problem. Your doctor might also want to press on your belly to feel for anything unusual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20386090\"><span class=\"h1\">How are AAAs treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on how big the AAA is. Some people need surgery to repair it. Others do not.</p><p>You might not need to have your AAA repaired right away if it is small, or if it is not getting bigger quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20386097\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if I have an AAA but don't need surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will suggest that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get regular tests to see how fast it is getting bigger &ndash; Your doctor will tell you how often you should get these tests based on the size of your AAA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicine to control your blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Call your doctor if you start having pain in your belly or back &ndash; Pain can be a sign that the AAA is bursting.</p><p/><p>People who have an AAA, even a small one, are at increased risk for heart disease. Your doctor can talk to you about ways to help lower your risk. This might include improving your diet, exercising more, and quitting smoking if you smoke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20386104\"><span class=\"h1\">When should AAAs be repaired?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Repair is the best treatment if your AAA is at a higher risk of bursting, which is more common if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your AAA is causing any symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your AAA is bigger than 5.5 centimeters (2.2 inches) wide</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your AAA gets more than 0.5 centimeters (0.2 inches) bigger in 6 months</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20386111\"><span class=\"h1\">How are AAAs repaired?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AAAs can be fixed in one of two ways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57520\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57520 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditional &quot;open&quot; surgery &ndash; For open AAA surgery, the doctor cuts open your belly and replaces the bulging part of the aorta with a tube called a &quot;graft.&quot; This tube is made from a special fabric, and is sewn into place. Blood can flow normally through it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endovascular stent graft &ndash; To fix the AAA this way, the doctor makes a cut in a blood vessel at the top of the thigh and inserts a folded graft. Then the doctor threads the graft up to the bulging part of the aorta and unfolds it. This type of graft does not need to be sewn into place. Blood flows through the graft.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20386118\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I know about the two repair options?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open surgery is a little riskier in the short term. But it fixes the AAA for good. Endovascular repair is less risky in the short term. But your doctor will need to watch you for problems that can happen afterwards. Endovascular grafts sometimes slip out of place and need to be fixed. (Fixing them usually involves a simpler procedure than the first one.) If your doctor offers you a choice between the 2 options, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risks of each procedure for me?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What kind of follow up will I need with each option?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is likely to happen if I do not have either treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20386272\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-dissection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Aortic dissection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Thoracic aortic aneurysm (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
