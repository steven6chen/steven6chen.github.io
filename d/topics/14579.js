A review found the following mental disorders were frequently observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affective disorders, particularly depression</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organic brain diseases (eg, dementia and delirium)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-related disorders (such as alcoholism)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Schizophrenia and other psychoses</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personality disorders</p><p/><p>These disorders account for a 1.5 to 3.0 times higher rate of hospitalization among dialysis patients compared to those with other chronic illnesses, thereby resulting in significant morbidity. In the previous study of approximately 175,000 dialysis patients, 9 percent were hospitalized with a mental disorder during a one-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A subsequent study from Japan reported a one-year 10.6 percent incidence of psychiatric disorders in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Dementia, delirium, and major depression were the most common disorders in this four-year follow-up study.</p><p>Patients maintained on hemodialysis are more likely to be hospitalized for a psychiatric disorder than are those treated with peritoneal dialysis. This difference may be due to patient selection for a particular dialysis modality or the increased incidence among hemodialysis patients of disruptive behaviors that may lead to hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Overall, the type of dialysis modality does not appear to have a significant impact upon symptoms related to depression, sexual function, and life satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>There is a paucity of data relating to the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in the treatment of psychiatric disorders occurring in patients with ESRD. It is unclear if the management is less successful, and thus hospitalization is more common. Resistance to therapy may also contribute to higher hospitalization rates.</p><p>Although few studies relating to the treatment of depression or other psychiatric disorders occurring in patients with ESRD exist, general recommendations for treating such individuals based upon outcomes among those without chronic kidney disease can be made. The types and treatment of psychiatric disorders in patients with ESRD are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEPRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression among dialysis patients may adversely affect mortality, possibly independent of dialysis adequacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. It is the most common psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization in this patient population, and can usually be successfully treated via the judicious use of medications, with or without counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression is common in dialysis patients. A meta-analysis of observational studies (198 samples, n &gt;46,000 dialysis patients) estimated that the point prevalence of depression was 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, most of the studies assessed depression either with patient self-report instruments or clinician administered instruments, which may overestimate the prevalence of depression. In the 28 samples of dialysis patients (n &gt;2800) in which depression was assessed according to diagnostic criteria elicited through a clinical interview, the estimated point prevalence was 23 percent. Nevertheless, even the figure of 23 percent is high; by contrast, a survey of the general population of 10 countries estimated that the point prevalence of major depression was roughly 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p>Depression may be present at the start of dialysis. This was suggested by the finding that 44 percent of 123 incident dialysis patients scored above the validated cut-off on the Beck Depression Inventory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, depression was most likely among Caucasians, patients without previous acquaintances on dialysis, and those with lower self-rated quality of life. A subsequent study of 272 consecutive patients at a Veterans Affairs Clinic found a 21 percent prevalence of a single depressive episode in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) without a difference in episodes by stage of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This suggests that screening for depression among CKD patients may be beneficial before the start of dialysis.</p><p>The most powerful predictor of depression in a long-term follow-up (16 months) study of hemodialysis patients with depression and anxiety was the degree of depressive affect at the time of initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In this study, 20 percent of patients had chronic depression or anxiety.</p><p>Anxiety may be common in hemodialysis patients and difficult to diagnose. One study found anxiety in 46 percent of 70 patients studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, a commonly used instrument, had a poor predictive value for anxiety in ESRD patients. The anxiety disorders negatively impacted the dialysis patients&rsquo; quality of life and were not simply manifestations of depression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with morbidity and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression in dialysis patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality; thus, management of patients should include screening for depression, provided that follow-up is available to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-depression-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for depression in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Depression is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization in dialysis patients. This appears to be independent of comorbid illnesses and demographic variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study examined patients who started hemodialysis (n &gt;8000) and were followed for up to one year; the analyses controlled for observed potential confounding factors, including demographics and physical and mental health problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The estimated probability of hospitalization was 12 percent greater in patients with depressed affect (dysphoria), compared with patients who were not dysphoric, and the median length of hospitalization was twice as long in dysphoric patients than patients who were not dysphoric (four versus two days). These results are consistent with the finding that major depression independently predicts hospitalization in patients with CKD who are not receiving dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, it is not clear whether these findings are due to poor compliance with medical treatment or other health-related behaviors that are associated with depression, or the physiologic effects of depression.</p><p>Depression in dialysis patients is also associated with a 40 to 50 percent increased risk of all cause mortality:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 14 observational studies (n &gt;33,000 dialysis patients) found that all cause mortality was greater in depressed patients than nondepressed patients (relative risk 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 12 observational studies that adjusted for covariates and included more than 21,000 dialysis patients, depression was associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] </p><p/><p>Heterogeneity across studies in both meta-analyses was moderate. </p><p>Suicide is more common among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients than the general population. Independent predictors include male gender, white or Asian race, recent hospitalization, and alcohol or drug-dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment and general criteria for diagnosing depressive syndromes apply similarly to patients with and without CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To ensure the identification of depression, the <span class=\"nowrap\">K/DOQI</span> guidelines suggest that every dialysis patient should be evaluated by the dialysis social worker upon initiation of dialysis and at least biannually subsequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, screening for depression in this patient population is controversial, in part because there are no data showing that screening improves overall patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Despite this, given the increased prevalence and morbidity associated with depression in dialysis patients, it is prudent to assume that actively screening for depression may lead to better outcomes. Some suggest using a screening tool, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), as the initial screen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If the BDI score is greater than 14, further evaluation should be performed. However, the utility of this screening method remains uncertain.</p><p>It is imperative to exclude uremia and assure adequate dialysis before diagnosing depression, since the symptoms of depression and those originating from a somatic process or disorder are similar:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs and symptoms of under-dialysis, including anorexia and failure to thrive, may mirror those of depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correction of fluctuating blood pressure, nausea, or other gastrointestinal complaints may improve quality of life and lift spirits in chronically ill patients; thus, such therapy may effectively treat psychosocial markers suggesting depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common complaints in the dialysis patient, such as chronic fatigue, weakness, and constipation, may reflect a psychosocial disturbance.</p><p/><p>Thus, an accurate assessment of such symptoms and signs relies upon the recognition that depression or related emotional concerns are additional diagnostic possibilities. An emphasis upon the cognitive aspects of depression (eg, impaired concentration and memory) rather than somatic complaints may be diagnostically helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H26342747\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Unipolar major depression'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who present with cognitive impairment require a mental status examination to help distinguish whether the cause is an encephalopathy or a depressive syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As an example, a prospective observational study of patients on peritoneal dialysis (n &gt;450), which controlled for potential confounding factors (eg, demographics, comorbidity, and laboratory parameters), found that depressive symptoms were associated with impairment of cognition, including executive function (eg, planning, problem solving, and sequencing actions) and memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Even a mild degree of depression was associated with cognitive dysfunction. </p><p>However, assessing cognitive function to distinguish encephalopathy from depression in dialysis patients is often difficult because of patient limitations. In a prospective study that examined cognitive function in 767 patients on dialysis, data were missing in 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The reasons for missing data included visual impairment, lack of motivation, and motor impairment. Patients with missing data were more likely to have depression than patients with complete cognitive testing data. Additional information about cognitive impairment in patients treated with dialysis, as well as assessing cognition, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive impairment, dementia, and delirium'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-mental-status-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The mental status examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The request to withdraw from dialysis may also suggest underlying depression, as well as other disorders. To optimally assess this situation, it must initially be determined that the patient is competent and fully comprehends that the consequences of withdrawing from dialysis include death, usually within one to two weeks. In patients who appear to have intact decision-making capacity, the nephrologist must exclude the subtle presence of factors such as situational depression, mild dementia, and uremic or toxic encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=withdrawal-from-and-withholding-of-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Withdrawal from and withholding of dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis is also confounded by patients who do not realize they are clinically depressed or who deny &quot;being depressed&quot; even when directly asked; this is due in part to the stigma long associated with mental illness. Among 30 peritoneal dialysis outpatients, for example, 46 percent were found to be in a &quot;state of hopelessness,&quot; 50 percent had anxiety, but only 13 percent met the criteria for depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The vast majority (93 percent) &quot;accepted their illness,&quot; an assessment that appears incongruent given that nearly one-half felt hopeless. By contrast, 55 percent of peritoneal dialysis patients eligible by Beck Depression Index criteria screening for further assessment to confirm the diagnosis of depression refused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of depression in dialysis patients is generally similar to that recommended in the general patient population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Treatment of resistant depression&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Although studies among ESRD patients are few, randomized trials of combined treatment with antidepressants and psychotherapy in the non-ESRD population results in greater success than treatment with medication alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Because psychosocial support and adherence to treatment are associated with reduced mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], psychotherapy may be an important component to the treatment regimen. Evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 12-week randomized trial compared cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBT; weekly sessions, each lasting 90 minutes) with usual care in 85 patients with ESRD and unipolar major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Improvement was greater with CBT than usual care, and the benefit persisted at the six-month follow-up. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent randomized trial compared individual CBT (10 weekly sessions, each lasting 60 minutes, administered chairside during dialysis) with a waiting list control condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The sample consisted of 65 patients with ESRD and moderate depression; 49 percent met criteria for unipolar major depression. Improvement of depression, quality of life, and fluid compliance was greater in patients who received CBT, and the benefit for depressive symptoms and quality of life persisted at the three-month follow-up. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A four-week randomized trial compared deep, slow diaphragmatic breathing during hemodialysis (two sessions per week, each lasting 30 minutes) with a waiting list control condition in patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Improvement of depressive symptoms, perceived role limitations, and quality of life were greater in patients who received active treatment. </p><p/><p>The urgency of treatment is primarily guided by the clinical circumstances and presentation. The patient must be questioned about suicidal thoughts and plans, and psychiatric referral made immediately if necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When there is no need for emergent psychiatric referral or hospitalization, treatment is dictated by the patient's needs and acceptance for medication and psychiatric referral, and the nephrologist's <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> primary care physician's comfort with prescribing antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The dialysis unit social worker's assessment may also be helpful in categorizing depression and directing therapeutic options.</p><p>When treating a dialysis patient with antidepressants, the following must be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antidepressants appear to be effective in approximately 75 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antidepressants usually require four to six weeks for full effect, although patients often begin to respond earlier.</p><p/><p>Thus, the choice of antidepressant is principally guided by cost and side effect profile. Since many antidepressants (regardless of class) are hepatically metabolized, dosage adjustment is sometimes not required for CKD. However, there are exceptions, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> (Paxil) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> (Effexor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Inadequate dosing of antidepressants is the most common cause of therapeutic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Regardless of the class of antidepressant prescribed, full therapeutic doses should be anticipated for at least six months to one year in all patients to reduce the likelihood of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Subsequent survey data suggest that depression is undertreated in dialysis patients despite being common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In Japan, the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of depression is more commonly observed than in other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a study using data from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS), benzodiazepine monotherapy was associated with an increased risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an increasing amount of literature about the efficacy of SSRIs in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/9,30,34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,30,34-38</a>].

However, certain features unique to these patients deserve some emphasis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with depression, the occurrence of dementia in a patient with CKD necessitates an evaluation for a medical condition, particularly a metabolic disorder. Uremia, as well as disturbances in fluid and electrolyte or mineral balance, may result in dementia. Thus, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, and hypercalcemia should be excluded.

Similarly, discontinuing or lowering the dose of medications that are possibly contributing to a decrease in mental status should also be performed, if possible. As an example, antiemetics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>, may cause neurologic effects in dialysis patients, thereby requiring dose adjustment in ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychiatric-illness-in-dialysis-patients/abstract/31,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,56</a>].

Current management of patients is still frequently limited to treatment of behavioral disturbances, environmental manipulations to support function, and counseling with respect to safety issues (specifically the need to provide safe dialysis); however, the near future promises disease-specific, and hopefully disease-modifying, treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although cholinesterase inhibitors, such as tacrine (now rarely used due to hepatotoxicity) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donepezil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">donepezil</a> may be helpful in treating dementia, there is no information concerning the pharmacokinetics or effectiveness of these agents in those with renal impairment.

These illnesses account for a 1.5 to 3.0 times higher rate of hospitalization among dialysis patients compared to patients with other chronic illnesses. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization in dialysis patients. The estimated prevalence of depression in dialysis patients is approximately 20 to 40 percent. Depression may adversely affect mortality, possibly independent of dialysis adequacy. In addition, suicide is significantly more common among ESRD patients than the general population. The criteria for diagnosing depression apply similarly to patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD). Depression can usually be treated successfully with medications, with or without counseling. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Depression'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-major-depression-in-adults-choosing-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar major depression in adults: Choosing initial treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive impairment is common in CKD and patients treated with dialysis. Patients treated with hemodialysis perform worse than the general population on tests of global cognition, attention and orientation, concept formation and reasoning, construction and motor performance, executive functioning, language, and memory. (See <a href=\"#H2888820065\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive impairment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high incidence of dementia among dialysis patients is likely because of the high number of older patients who are started on dialysis and are at high risk for dementia due to vascular disease. The major dementia syndromes in patients with and without CKD include Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and related dementias, frontal lobe dementia, and reversible dementias. The evaluation of dementia in the dialysis patient is generally the same as in the nondialysis patient. Dementia due to structural and <span class=\"nowrap\">metabolic/electrolyte</span> disorders may be reversible with appropriate therapy. Medications that impair cognition should be reduced if feasible. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Dementia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although many of the causes of delirium are similar in those with and without CKD, some are specifically related to patients with ESRD. These include drugs that can accumulate because of the lack of renal excretion (including illicit drugs), ingestion of star fruit (Averrhoa carambola) or the mushroom Sugihiratake, the dialysis disequilibrium syndrome, hemodynamic instability (hypotension or hypertension), cerebrovascular disease (such as hypertensive encephalopathy, infarction, hemorrhage, and subdural hematoma), aluminum intoxication, electrolyte disorders (such as hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, and hypernatremia), vitamin deficiencies (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a>), seizures, a structural central nervous system lesion (eg, tumor or subdural hematoma), and uremic encephalopathy.
