However, in immunocompromised patients, such as those with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), it can result in severe debilitating chronic diarrhea with wasting.</p><p>The clinical management of patients with <em>Cystoisospora</em> infection will be discussed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of <em>Cystoisospora </em>infection are discussed elsewhere.

For certain patients, especially immunocompromised hosts, antibiotic therapy against the pathogen is also administered. There are special treatment considerations for HIV-infected individuals, such as early initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy and secondary prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H31776317\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prophylaxis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H26461424\" class=\"local\">'Antiretroviral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1439256647\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORTIVE CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31776254\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid and electrolyte support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with <em>Cystoisospora</em> infection may have evidence of severe volume depletion and electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and bicarbonate wasting. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is critical with intravenous crystalloid, as well as supplementation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a>. Cardiac monitoring may be necessary for patients with severe electrolyte imbalances.

Immunocompromised patients (eg, patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]) who have chronic diarrhea from enteric pathogens often have malabsorption of fats and vitamins, which can lead to elevated prothrombin and low serum albumin levels. Malnutrition can also lead to significant thymic gland atrophy that can affect T cell mediated immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31776268\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387916375\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97354156\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunocompetent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the immunocompetent host, symptoms of <em>Cystoisospora</em> infection are usually self-limited. We would administer antimicrobial therapy to such patients only if symptoms did not start to resolve spontaneously (eg, after five to seven days, depending upon severity). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX), one double-strength tablet (160 mg TMP component) orally twice daily for 7 to 10 days, is usually sufficient for eradication of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In patients allergic to TMP-SMX, we prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (500 mg twice daily for 7 to 10 days) based principally upon data derived from the treatment of immunocompromised hosts.

Most published experience is in individuals with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Limited case reports describe treatment in other immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p>For immunocompromised patients, we administer initial therapy with oral or intravenous TMP-SMX (160 mg TMP component) twice daily for 7 to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most patients with mild or moderate disease can be started on oral therapy, whereas those with severe, cholera-like diarrhea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malabsorption will require intravenous therapy. In patients with severe immunosuppression (eg, HIV-infected patients with CD4 cell counts &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> solid organ transplant recipients, other immunocompromised individuals with recurrent symptoms), the initial course of antibiotics may be followed by suppressive doses (ie, secondary prophylaxis) because symptoms can recur once treatment has been discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/3,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H31776317\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>This approach is based upon the following two clinical studies in Haiti that enrolled small numbers of HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Symptomatic improvement was usually dramatic with resolution of symptoms within two days of treatment initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Both of these trials were conducted before the era of potent antiretroviral therapy and the CD4 cell counts of the enrolled patients were not specified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 20 patients with a history of chronic diarrhea and <em>Cystoisospora</em> infection were treated with TMP-SMX (160 mg TMP component) four times daily for 10 days, followed by twice daily for three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. One patient had to stop therapy because of a pruritic drug rash. Approximately half of the patients had a recurrence of symptomatic infection within a mean of eight weeks of treatment discontinuation; all responded to a repeat course of TMP-SMX within approximately two days. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent trial compared the efficacy of TMP-SMX (160 mg TMP component) twice daily with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (500 mg) twice daily for the treatment and prevention of chronic diarrhea in 42 HIV-infected patients, of whom approximately half had infection with <em>Cystoisospora</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-cystoisospora-isospora-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At the end of treatment, the proportion of patients with symptom resolution and microbiologic cure (100 and 83 percent, respectively) was superior in the TMP-SMX arm compared with the ciprofloxacin arm (90 and 75 percent, respectively). Patients who had evidence of persistent <em>Cystoisospora</em> infection after initial treatment with ciprofloxacin had eradication of their infection after being switched to TMP-SMX. The duration of diarrhea was also shorter in patients assigned to the TMP-SMX arm (2 versus 4.2 days).</p><p/><p>The management of patients who cannot take TMP-SMX, as well as those who continue to have diarrhea 48 hours after starting treatment, is described below.
