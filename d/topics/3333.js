They cause similar symptoms.</p><p>These infections can affect the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectum or anus (especially in men who have sex with men)</p><p/><p>Infections that you can catch during sex are called &quot;sexually transmitted infections.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458933046\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of chlamydia and gonorrhea?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often these infections cause no symptoms. But when they do, the symptoms are different for men than for women.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <strong>women</strong>, the symptoms of both infections include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vaginal discharge or itching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormal vaginal bleeding or spotting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain during sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Burning or pain during urination</p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In <strong>men</strong>, the symptoms of both infections include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Burning or pain during urination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Discharge from the penis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain, swelling, or tenderness of the testicles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In men who have sex with men, both infections can also cause rectal pain, discharge, and bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458933053\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can test you for these infections using a:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine sample</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sample from inside the vagina, if you are a woman</p><p/><p>Your doctor or nurse might also take a sample from your throat or rectum, if those areas might be infected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458933060\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, you should see a doctor or nurse if you have any of the symptoms listed above. You should also see a doctor or nurse if any of your sexual partners have been diagnosed with either infection. Even if you have no symptoms, you could be infected.</p><p>Your doctor might want to test you for sexually transmitted infections now and in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458933067\"><span class=\"h1\">How are chlamydia and gonorrhea treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment for both infections is antibiotics. The antibiotics for gonorrhea come in a single shot and a pill. The antibiotic for chlamydia comes in a pill. Treatment might involve taking a single pill, or it might involve taking medicine for a whole week. No matter what, make sure you take all the pills your doctor or nurse prescribes. Otherwise the infection might come back.</p><p>If you have chlamydia or gonorrhea, you should tell the person you last had sex with, and anyone you have had sex with in the past 2 to 3 months. They might also be infected (even if they have no symptoms) and need treatment.</p><p>Many people with chlamydia or gonorrhea get the infection again after treatment. After getting treated, you should get tested again a few months later, even if you have no symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458933074\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if I don't get treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leaving chlamydia or gonorrhea untreated can cause long-term problems for both men and women. In women it can lead to a problem called &quot;pelvic inflammatory disease,&quot; or &quot;PID.&quot; PID can cause pain and make it hard to get pregnant. In men and women, leaving gonorrhea untreated can lead to joint infections and arthritis. It can also increase the risk of becoming infected with HIV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458933081\"><span class=\"h1\">Can chlamydia and gonorrhea prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting chlamydia or gonorrhea by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a latex condom every time you have sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding sex when you or your partner has any symptoms that could be caused by an infection (such as itching, discharge, or pain with urination)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having sex</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458933088\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Screening for sexually transmitted infections (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Genital herpes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anogenital-warts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anogenital warts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Trichomoniasis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
