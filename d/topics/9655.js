In this context, inflammation refers to bursal swelling with or without tenderness, redness, compression of neighboring structures, or documented rupture. However, some knee pain syndromes that have been commonly labelled &quot;bursitis&quot; are actually unrelated to bursae. One such example is that of pes anserine pain syndrome (PAPS), which was formerly referred to as anserine bursitis. This topic will review the diagnosis and management of PAPS, prepatellar and superficial infrapatellar bursitis, and other pain syndromes related to other bursae around the knee. An overview of bursitis as well as a discussion on septic bursitis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-an-overview-of-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bursitis: An overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-bursitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic bursitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809402\"><span class=\"h1\">PES ANSERINUS PAIN SYNDROME (FORMERLY ANSERINE BURSITIS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pes anserinus pain syndrome (PAPS), previously known as &quot;anserine bursitis,&quot; is a common, clinically defined condition that features pain around the medial knee and tenderness over the upper medial tibia. &quot;Pes anserinus&quot; refers to the insertional footprint of the conjoined tendons of sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus, which is said to resemble the footprint of a goose (&quot;anser&quot; in Latin and old Spanish). Local swelling is rarely present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology, treatment, and long-term course of PAPS are not well-defined. Ultrasonography (US) studies in PAPS have only rarely shown bursitis or tendonitis; therefore, PAPS should no longer be classified as a bursitis. However, there are rare cases of true anserine bursitis in which localized swelling, rather than pain, is the chief complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The anserine bursa may also be the site of proliferative and inflammatory conditions, which are described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H217809495\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809408\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a large, population-based study in Mexico with almost 13,000 surveyed individuals, PAPS had a prevalence of 0.34 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In another study of 4240 subjects from three indigenous groups from Mexico and one from Argentina, the prevalence of PAPS was 0.54 percent of males and 0.7 percent of females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Estimates of PAPS among patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) are higher, as there appears to be an association between PAPS and knee OA. As an example, in a small observational study including 37 patients with PAPS, 93 percent also had knee OA, the majority of whom were obese women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another observational study of 50 patients with 90 symptomatic osteoarthritic knees, PAPS was present in 73 knees (83 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809414\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an established association of PAPS with diabetes. In one study, PAPS was present in 34 (36 percent) of 94 non-insulin-dependent diabetics, while there were no cases of PAPS among the 57 non-diabetic controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This finding was confirmed in another study of 100 diabetic patients and 102 matched controls, which found PAPS among 38 diabetic patients compared with 17 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Based upon clinical experience and limited available evidence, other risk factors for PAPS include female sex, obesity, knee OA, and knee malalignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/8,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,12</a>]. Additional, larger studies of risk factors for PAPS in which the precise site of tenderness is determined clinically or by US are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809420\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiopathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of PAPS remains speculative, as inflammation is rarely present in the anserine bursa or the pes anserinus in patients with PAPS. The frequent association of PAPS with knee OA, obesity, and angular deformity of the knee strongly suggest that a mechanical derangement within the medial knee joint causes referred pain experienced at the upper medial tibia.</p><p>The low incidence of inflammation around the anserine bursa and surrounding tendons has been demonstrated in several US studies of patients with PAPS. In one study of 37 patients with PAPS, only one patient had US evidence of pes anserine bursitis, and two patients had pes anserinus tendinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a subsequent US study including 73 knees with PAPS among 50 patients with symptomatic knee OA, there was no ultrasound evidence of anserine bursitis or pes anserinus tendinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, PAPS was frequently associated with a medial meniscus protrusion and displacement of the medial collateral ligament (also referred to as the tibial collateral ligament). In a study in which 85 patients had PAPS and symptomatic knee OA, 20 percent had ultrasound evidence of anserine bursitis based upon a bursal thickness of &ge;2 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the study did not evaluate the local tendons, ligaments, or menisci. Finally, in a study of 348 Korean subjects with a mean age of 72, 50.6 percent of whom were females, 120 had OA and 146 had knee pain. By magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), anserine bursitis was present in 17.5 and 2.2 percent of subjects with and without OA, respectively, and in 14.4 and 2.5 percent of subjects with and without knee pain, respectively. The presence of PAPS, which is a clinical diagnosis, cannot be determined in this study. Also, MRI may be more sensitive than US to detect effusions around the anserine bursa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Based on US data, a protruded medial meniscus may cause PAPS either directly or by stretching the medial collateral ligament in patients with knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A valgus knee angulation creating excessive traction forces on the medial collateral ligament may explain PAPS in other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In the author's opinion, PAPS is not a condition per se, but rather a red flag that points to some articular or periarticular derangement in the medial knee that warrants further investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809426\"><span class=\"h2\">Relevant anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medial aspect of the knee is a multilayered, complex restraining structure in which the individual components slide upon each other during knee flexion and extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Pertinent structures described from internal to external are as follows: the medial meniscus; the medial (tibial) collateral ligament that is adherent to the meniscus in its midportion; several bursae, including the anserine bursa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F114915\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114915 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F114866\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114866 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F114865\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114865 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], a bursa between the superficial and deep layers of the proximal medial collateral ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], and a bursa partially tucked under the posterior medial collateral ligament that is saddled on an anterior reflection of semimembranosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]; the pes anserinus; and the subcutaneous fat pad.</p><p>The anserine bursa is a large (about 7 cm in length), roughly oval synovial sac that extends from the tibial joint line to the insertion of pes anserinus. Its long diameter lies beneath the anterior medial collateral ligament in knee extension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and is uncovered and at a 90-degree angle in knee flexion. This angular motion may be facilitated by internal gliding between the bursal walls. The lubrication of the anserine bursa has not been studied; however, the viscous fluid aspirated from cystic distensions suggests that there is a high hyaluronate content in the normal state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The semimembranosus bursa may facilitate the interplay between the posterior medial collateral ligament, the anterior reflection of the semimembranosus tendon insertion, and the posterior osseous corner of the joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] and prevent friction between these structures in the normal state.</p><p>The pes anserinus tendons are arranged in two layers: the sartorius is superficial, and the partially overlapping gracilis and semitendinosus tendons are beneath the sartorius tendon. The combined width of these tendons is approximately 4.5 cm. The saphenous nerve, which contributes to the innervation of the medial and anterior knee, descends along the medial side of the knee behind the sartorius.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809432\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no established diagnostic criteria for PAPS.

If the pain is unilateral, the unaffected knee should be examined first to establish a baseline. The physical examination in patients with medial knee pain due to suspected PAPS should include attention to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assessment of knee alignment</strong> &ndash; Assessment of knee alignment may reveal a valgus or varus deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62835\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62835 \">figure 4</a>).

With the patient supine, and the knees flexed 90 degrees, the patient is asked to press their heels against the examining table. Two of the pes anserinus tendons should be prominent in the medial popliteal fossa. The medial tendon is the gracilis, and 1 to 2 cm lateral to it is the prominent and sharp semitendinosus tendon. An imaginary line that follows these tendons intersects the tibia at the pes anserinus enthesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93945\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93945 \">picture 2</a>). Then, several structures may be palpated in the following sequence: the pes anserinus enthesis, the anserine tendons (that have now moved posterior to the bursa), the upper medial tibia, and the joint line down to its posteromedial corner. It is at this site where the semimembranosus reaches the tibia. This cylindrical, nontendinous, fleshy structure runs anterior and parallel to the gracilis tendon and should be a helpful landmark to identify tenderness in cases of semimembranosus-tibial collateral ligament bursitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medial joint line palpation </strong>&ndash; Tenderness at the medial joint line (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F93945\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93945 \">picture 2</a>) may suggest a meniscal tear, protrusion, or cyst; bursitis in one of the regional bursae; a tender osteophyte at the femoral condylar rim; subcutaneous fat pad tenderness; or fibromyalgia.

As discussed above, US findings are usually unremarkable (see <a href=\"#H217809420\" class=\"local\">'Etiopathogenesis'</a> above). However, if a bulge or induration is present in the medial aspect of the knee, US evaluation may reveal a fluid collection within the anserine or other bursa, a bursal lesion such as synovial chondromatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] or pigmented villonodular synovitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], or, in the worst scenario, a sarcoma. The evaluation of these lesions is discussed elsewhere.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging</strong> &ndash; MRI can also be useful in the assessment of knee OA, and is important when a bulge is palpated and an US study reveals a solid lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809495\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>True anserine bursitis</strong> &ndash; Patients with true anserine bursitis present with localized swelling, with or without fluctuation, and little pain. If acute pain, swelling, and redness over the bursa are also present, a diagnosis of bursal gout <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> septic bursitis should be considered. Although gouty involvement of the bursa has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], the author has never seen such cases. The saphenous nerve, which lies in close association with pes anserinus, may be compressed by bursal swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other bursitis in the medial knee</strong> &ndash; Other bursae around the medial knee can cause localized swelling and tenderness at the medial joint line.

In this friction syndrome, while snapping may occur, the main symptom is pain. In these patients, the distance between sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus tendons and the posterior medial condyle may be shortened and cause intervening edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In other cases, a prominent tibial crest impinges on the neighboring soft tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The prominence of this fat pad may be accentuated by genu valgum. Pinching the fat pad between the thumb and index triggers severe pain. The absence of generalized tenderness can help distinguish this condition from fibromyalgia. Gross, symmetrical fat swelling in the medial knees, known as &quot;symmetric lipomatosis,&quot; is quite rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and should be distinguished from adiposis dolorosa (Dercum disease) in which there are multiple fat nodules that are small (&lt;2 cm diameter), tender, and have characteristic features on US or MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

The tender points described in fibromyalgia patients include the medial fat pad proximal to the joint line (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77950 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This location is higher than the tenderness associated with PAPS. However, in both conditions the tenderness may involve an area rather than a discrete point. To circumvent this difficulty, the contralateral medial knee as well as the remaining fibromyalgia tender points should be examined. Since fibromyalgia and PAPS may coincide, a gross discrepancy in tenderness between both knees should make the clinician consider an overlap. An immediate, complete, and lasting response to a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/steroid</span> infiltration can also help identify of PAPS in the setting of fibromyalgia.

Strengthening exercises are reviewed below. Weight-reduction programs and the use of analgesics are reviewed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H3693478\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'NSAIDs'</a>). Since PAPS is thought to be related to an underlying knee condition such as OA or an angulation deformity (eg, valgus or varus), local treatment measures typically provide only transient relief. Exercises are a possible exception, as they strengthen the muscles acting on the knee as well as improve the patient's overall fitness. However, no long-term studies of exercise in OA have focused on the effects of medial knee pain.</p><p>Of the quadriceps-strengthening exercises, the author prefers isometric quadriceps setting exercises performed with the legs in extension. In this position, the quadriceps-patella-tibial spine pull is parallel to the femoral condyles, thereby avoiding the patellofemoral stress that would occur with knee flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although ideally a physical therapist should instruct and supervise the strengthening exercises, a simple exercise that may help patients if added to their daily routines is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While lying supine in bed with both legs in extension, the patient concentrates on the anterior thigh in the unaffected leg and contracts the quadriceps (front thigh muscles) maximally. The contraction is held for six seconds, counting aloud while watching a clock, and then the muscle is allowed to relax. The quadriceps contraction is then attempted on the affected side. Initially, it is sometimes necessary to have someone else (eg, spouse, child) ascertain that the muscle actually contracts. This may be difficult at first when knee pain is severe. A modest twitch of contraction may be all that can be achieved at first, but with practice, a full contraction will later appear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The isometric contraction is repeated, alternating sides, for an increasing number of times as tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These exercises are performed twice a day, and are most convenient when performed before getting up in the morning and upon retiring at night, with an increasing number of maximal contractions to a target number of 10 six-second contractions on each side.</p><p/><p>If after one month there is no improvement, it is unlikely that this strengthening regimen will relieve pain.</p><p>As mentioned previously, many of patients with PAPS may also have underlying knee OA, which requires concomitant therapy. The management of OA is discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;</a>).

The knee is then brought into extension and the needle is inserted at a 30-degree angle, distal to proximal, 3 cm proximal to the mark. An area about 3 cm in diameter is then injected, moving the needle back and forth, adjacent to periosteum (likely intrabursal), from the single initial entry. The author uses a 40 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> mixed with 4 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 2% without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, in a 22-gauge needle and a 10 mL syringe.</p><p>The evidence supporting the efficacy of glucocorticoid injections in PAPS is limited and inconsistent. Glucocorticoid injections have traditionally been considered useful in PAPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], at least in the short term, and this has been consistent with the author's experience. However, a randomized controlled trial comparing the injection of 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> acetate mixed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> and lidocaine mixed with water in patients with PAPS showed a 60 percent improvement in both treatment groups at four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In another study, 60 PAPS patients with knee OA were randomized to receive a local injection of 40 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide in the most tender point or a two-week course of physical therapy consisting of hot packs, ultrasound, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) to the pes anserinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Both groups improved similarly after eight weeks. No sham-treated patients were included. It is therefore possible that the time-honored efficacy of glucocorticoid injections and physical therapy modalities in PAPS may have been a placebo effect. An additional study of OA patients with PAPS compared sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> 25 mg in 1 mL given as mesotherapy, three times per week for three weeks, with oral sodium diclofenac 50 mg given daily for three weeks.

Once again, no sham-controlled group was included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Additional controlled studies are needed in PAPS comparing US-guided versus blind injections with the knee at 90-degree flexion to better define the pain-generating structure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809572\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPATELLAR AND SUPERFICIAL INFRAPATELLAR BURSITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prepatellar and superficial infrapatellar bursitis are common conditions presenting as localized tenderness and swelling anterior to the patella or patellar tendon. The prepatellar and superficial infrapatellar bursae may be affected by, in decreasing order of frequency, infection, chronic or acute trauma, gout, and rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809578\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies, all in the field of occupational medicine, have addressed the epidemiology and risk factors of prepatellar or superficial infrapatellar bursitis. Penetrating trauma and jobs that require prolonged kneeling, such as mining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], carpet laying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], and the clergy, are known causes of this condition. Kneeling affects the patellar tendon and the tibial tubercle, rather than the patella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/43,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,45</a>]. In addition, the exposed nature of the prepatellar region is a prime site for blunt and shear trauma, affecting the bursae or the surrounding subcutaneous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809584\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors may determine the development of prepatellar or superficial infrapatellar bursitis. One is the thinness of the skin over these bursae, which both chronic glucocorticoid therapy and old age accentuate. Another factor is the sparse innervation of the acral skin. Pinch as hard as you can the skin in front of your patella or at the tip of your elbow and little pain will occur. The acral exposure of subcutaneous bursae also renders them vulnerable to occupational and recreational trauma. It is of interest that tophi and rheumatoid nodules, that are known to occur at pressure points, grow in the superficial bursal wall and move freely with the skin, whereas the hard pebbles that are palpable in traumatic bursitis are fixed at the bottom of the bursal sac. Finally, due to their location in the convex side of a joint, in a fluid-distended bursa, flexion of the joint further increases the intrabursal pressures, sometimes to the point of rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H788699\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute causes of bursitis are usually septic (from common skin bacteria) and less frequently due to gout, but they can also be due to trauma (eg, a hemobursa). Chronic bursitis, on the other hand, is generally traumatic, but may also be due to gout, and rarely a fastidious infection.</p><p>Immunosuppressed hosts are also prone to subcutaneous bursitis. Other predisposing factors for acute bursitis include diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), metastatic cancer, hemodialysis, emphysema and glucocorticoid use. Hemobursa is a rare cause of acute prepatellar or superficial infrapatellar bursitis, except in cases of occupational exposure or anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/43,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,50</a>].

There are three overlapping bursae beneath the prepatellar skin. A subcutaneous bursa lies between the deep dermis and a tenuous fascial plane derived from the fascia lata. This bursa appears to be most frequently involved in prepatellar bursitis. There is also an intermediate bursal space between the fascial plane and oblique fibers derived from the muscles vastus medialis and vastus lateralis. Finally, a third bursal space separates the latter from vertical fibers of rectus anterior layered on, and firmly attached to, the patella. Based upon clinical observations, the latter two bursae are rarely involved in disease.</p><p>The superficial infrapatellar (or pretendinous) bursa is a subcutaneous bursa distal to the prepatellar bursa and anterior to the patellar tendon. The deep infrapatellar bursa, which is located at the insertional angle between the patellar tendon and the upper tibia, is distal to the superficial infrapatellar bursa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F103906\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103906 \">picture 8</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H788477\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with bursitis of the prepatellar or the superficial infrapatellar bursae may present with either acute of chronic symptoms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute bursitis</strong> &ndash; Patients with acute prepatellar or superficial infrapatellar bursitis present with localized redness, swelling, and marked tenderness anterior to the patella or patellar tendon.

This useful clinical sign derives from the fact that in a conscious patient, acute knee arthritis automatically brings the joint to semiflexion, a position in which, for a given volume of effusion, intraarticular pressures are lowest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bursal rupture</strong> &ndash; The high cavitary tension generated by an effusion, plus an effort in flexion which further increases the intrabursal pressures, may rupture the bursal sac.

Occasionally the clinician may be surprised by the aspiration of pure blood. An early hemobursa may give no clue as to the nature of the effusion, although in a few days a large ecchymosis will appear. In early septic and gouty bursitis, the bursal fluid white cell count may be only mildly elevated, but a high percentage of neutrophils is a tell-tale sign of one of these diagnoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F103907\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103907 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/54,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,60</a>].

With the exception of septic and gouty knee bursitis, isolated bursitis of the prepatellar or superficial infrapatellar bursa is usually a self-limited condition. Therefore, the goal of treatment is to relieve the immediate symptoms and prevent repetitive trauma. Traumatic effusions resolve slowly, typically within a few weeks to three months. We do not administer a local glucocorticoid injection in the prepatellar or pretendinous bursae due to the risk of promoting an infection. The use of protective knee braces, as developed for the prevention of knee injuries in high risk occupations, is important when kneeling cannot be avoided. Chemical ablation has also been used in refractory cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

The treatment of septic bursitis is discussed in detail separately.

If there are no crystals and the Gram stain is negative, very symptomatic patients may be treated with full doses of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), with attention to age and comorbidities.

Patients can present with lateral knee pain aggravated by palpation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]; in the author's experience, biceps femoris bursitis has been observed in competitive volleyball and basketball players. Because of this location of the bursa, the common peroneal nerve may be compressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809710\"><span class=\"h2\">Semimembranosus-tibial collateral ligament bursitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The semimembranosus bursa is located at the posteromedial aspect of the knee, at the medial aspect of the semimembranosus tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F108899\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108899 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The semimembranosus bursa can be identified by palpation with the patient in the sitting position. Semimembranosus, which is muscle almost to its insertion site, is often felt as a thin cylinder (about 2 cm in diameter) that runs above gracilis, meets the tibia, and contracts with resistance of internal rotation of the foot. The semimembranosus bursa (not to be confused with the semimembranous-gastrocnemius bursa which is the substrate of the Baker cyst) is present at this site. Semimembranosus bursitis has been documented anatomically by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but there is limited information on the clinical syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Bursitis may be suspected in patients with pain and tenderness at the posterior medial knee, localized swelling, and possibly a posteromedial friction syndrome.</p><p>The frequency of semimembranosus-tibial collateral ligament bursitis is not known. In the author's opinion, cases of semimembranosus-tibial collateral ligament bursitis may be overlooked in patients thought to have pes anserine pain syndrome (PAPS) diagnosed by palpation, and injected, in knee extension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H217809716\"><span class=\"h2\">Deep infrapatellar bursitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The deep infrapatellar bursa (DIB), which is homologous to the retrocalcaneal bursa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>], is wedged between the patellar tendon and the anterior upper tibia. Rather than contributing to tissue gliding, these bursae allow a more distal and mechanically advantageous insertion of the patellar tendon and the Achilles tendon, respectively, at their insertion sites. The spacer that allows such action is a fat wedge that enters the DIB in knee extension, and the retrocalcaneal bursa in foot plantar flexion, as the insertional angles open. The intermittent wall-on-wall pressure that occurs when the foot is dorsally flexed in the retrocalcaneal bursa, and the knee is flexed in the DIB, leads to fibrocartilage formation in the opposing walls. The DIB and the retrocalcaneal bursa and related tissues are prototypical target organs in spondyloarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/68,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,70</a>]. There are also occasional cases described of DIB due to infection and gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of DIB includes Osgood-Schlatter (OS) disease and Sinding-Larsen-Johansson (SLJ) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/knee-bursitis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Both are overload syndromes in adolescents who are active in sports. Pain, tenderness, and swelling occur at the lower pole of the patella in SLJ, and at the tibial tuberosity in OS. The distinction between OS or SLJ disease from DIB may be difficult (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-chronic-knee-pain-or-injury-in-children-or-skeletally-immature-adolescents#H2435836826\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to chronic knee pain or injury in children or skeletally immature adolescents&quot;, section on 'Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tubercle apophysitis)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-chronic-knee-pain-or-injury-in-children-or-skeletally-immature-adolescents#H1316832081\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to chronic knee pain or injury in children or skeletally immature adolescents&quot;, section on 'Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease (patellar apophysitis)'</a>). An associated Achilles tendon enthesitis, lower-extremity arthritis, and an increased level of acute phase reactants all suggest the presence of spondyloarthritis.

Ultrasonography (US) studies in PAPS have only rarely shown bursitis or tendonitis; therefore, PAPS should no longer be classified as a bursitis. However, there are rare cases of true anserine bursitis in which localized swelling, rather than pain, is the chief complaint. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H217809402\" class=\"local\">'Pes anserinus pain syndrome (formerly anserine bursitis)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for PAPS include knee osteoarthritis (OA), obesity, female sex, knee malalignment and diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H217809414\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no established diagnostic criteria for PAPS. We diagnose PAPS in patients with medial knee pain, tenderness over the upper medial tibia between the pes anserinus and the tibial joint line, and without local swelling or induration. In patients with symmetric pain, tenderness due to a tender, thick medial fat pad, and fibromyalgia should be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H217809432\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PAPS should be suspected in patients who seek medical attention for one of the following three reasons (see <a href=\"#H456955649\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medial knee pain with activities such as rising from a chair, ascending or descending stairs, or lying in bed with one knee pressing on the other (which may disturb sleep).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapidly mounting knee pain in a patient with knee OA.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The transition of pain with activity to pain at night in a patient with known knee OA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination in patients with medial knee pain due to suspected PAPS should include attention to knee alignment and areas of focal tenderness around the medial joint. (See <a href=\"#H217809451\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although imaging is generally not necessary to diagnose PAPS, conventional knee radiographs should be obtained in most patients to detect underlying OA. If local swelling or induration is present, US or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be obtained to exclude alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H217809464\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes a variety of other conditions that can lead to medial knee pain. (See <a href=\"#H217809495\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial treatment of PAPS includes a weight-reduction program, quadriceps strengthening exercises, and the use of an analgesic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> short term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For patients who do not improve with initial therapy, a local glucocorticoid injection typically is administered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F101417\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101417 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F103701\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103701 \">picture 6</a>). Occasionally a glucocorticoid injection may be given as part of the initial therapy in patients who have night pain that disrupts sleep. (See <a href=\"#H217809509\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H217809522\" class=\"local\">'Persistent symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepatellar and superficial infrapatellar bursitis present as localized tenderness and swelling anterior to the patella or patellar tendon. The prepatellar and superficial infrapatellar bursae may be affected by, in decreasing order of frequency, infection, chronic or acute trauma, gout, and rheumatoid arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H788477\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the presence of bursitis is confirmed by clinical history and physical examination, diagnostic testing for acute or chronic prepatellar or superficial infrapatellar bursitis includes laboratory testing, bursal fluid analysis, and imaging. A key component of the evaluation is the exclusion of septic bursitis, which requires bursal aspiration and analysis with a white cell count and differential, glucose concentration, crystal identification, Gram stain, and culture. (See <a href=\"#H217809596\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H456955662\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of prepatellar or superficial infrapatellar bursitis is guided by the underlying cause. With the exception of septic bursitis, isolated bursitis of the prepatellar or superficial infrapatellar bursa is usually a self-limited condition. Patients with septic bursitis, in addition to the antibiotic treatment, are locally managed with transient immobilization of the knee and re-aspirations as needed. If gout is proven by crystal identification and the Gram stain of the bursal fluid is negative, patients should be treated for gout. (See <a href=\"#H217809686\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other types of knee bursitis include biceps femoris bursitis, semimembranosus-tibial collateral ligament bursitis, and deep infrapatellar bursitis.
