However, pulmonary tumor embolism refers to the identification of tumor within pulmonary arteries <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> capillaries on pathologic lung samples, whereas pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis refers to the identification of tumor in pulmonary lymphatic vessels. Since both entities are similarly evaluated and treated, distinguishing one from other has little clinical significance.

The etiology and pathogenesis of these disorders are discussed separately.

Consequently, the diagnosis often remains unsuspected and not made until autopsy. Traditionally, it is thought that pulmonary tumor embolism is more likely to present with features suggestive of pulmonary hypertension or venous thromboembolism (dyspnea, hypoxemia, right heart strain, and clear lungs) while pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis is more likely to present with the features of interstitial lung disease (eg, fever, bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging). However, clinical and pathological overlap between the entities is common. (See <a href=\"#H4154844332\" class=\"local\">'Definitive pathologic diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4187684528\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive, unexplained dyspnea is the most common symptom that occurs in up to 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1,2,8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8-13</a>]. Dyspnea is often subacute (over weeks) but can be rapid (over days). &#160;</p><p>Pleuritic chest pain can occur, particularly in patients with lymphangitic carcinomatosis when obstructed pleural lymphatics are involved with tumor. </p><p>Cough, hemoptysis, fatigue, and weight loss occur less commonly. While some of these symptoms may be explained by tumor embolism or lymphangitis, they may also be due to the underlying cancer.</p><p>Rarely, patients present suddenly with overwhelming shock from acute massive tumor embolism</p><p>A diagnosis of cancer is usually, but not always, present and patients may have advanced, metastatic, or occult disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>].</p><p>Patients are rarely asymptomatic. Case reports of patients with imaging features suggestive of either embolization or lymphangitis found incidentally during surveillance for known cancer have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>The physical examination usually reveals tachypnea and tachycardia and low grade fever. Signs of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, such as an increase in the pulmonic component of the second heart sound, a right ventricular lift, cyanosis, and jugular venous distention may be more likely in patients with tumor emboli than lymphangitis. Crackles or adventitious sounds are unusual but may be more likely to be heard in patients with lymphangitic carcinomatosis than in tumor emboli syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1777596201\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most imaging studies are insensitive for the diagnosis of pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis. However, many of these imaging modalities are performed because venous thromboembolism or other etiologies are suspected. Importantly, these tests are usually not diagnostic and up to 50 percent of patients have normal imaging, particularly in the early phase. However, imaging studies may provide subtle clues to help raise the clinical suspicion for underlying tumor embolism or lymphangitis in the event that other more common etiologies are ruled out. (See <a href=\"#H779306596\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Imaging may show features of one or both entities and include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chest radiography</strong> &ndash; Chest radiography is often initially normal but as the disease progresses it may show diffuse reticular and nodular infiltrates, coarse bronchovascular markings, or Kerley B lines suggestive of lymphangitic edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1,2,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,17</a>]. Occasionally, lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions are also seen. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The signs of pulmonary hypertension may indicate elevated pulmonary pressures from pulmonary tumor embolism (eg, enlarged pulmonary arteries, enlarged right heart) but can also be less commonly seen in lymphangitic carcinomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventilation-perfusion lung scintigraphy</strong> &ndash; Ventilation-perfusion lung scans may be normal or demonstrate multiple, small, peripheral, subsegmental perfusion defects (&quot;mottled&quot; or &quot;beaded&quot; appearance) with normal ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

While some experts believe that nodular septae may help distinguish lymphangitic carcinomatosis from other interstitial disorders, in general, overlap with other diseases including sarcoidosis and asbestosis is not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some cases may have ground glass densities that may represent interstitial edema. Hilar adenopathy and effusions may occasionally be present. In contrast, a dilated, beaded or tree-in-bud appearance of pulmonary arteries on CT pulmonary angiography may be more characteristic of tumor embolism than lymphangitic carcinomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conventional pulmonary</strong> <strong>angiography</strong> &ndash; Older reports from an era where conventional pulmonary angiography was more commonly performed in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) report subtle abnormalities such as subsegmental filling defects, pruning and tortuosity of the third to fifth order vessels, or delayed filling of segmental arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21,22</a>]. However, these findings are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of tumor embolism or lymphangitic carcinomatosis.

A mild leukocytosis is not unusual and may represent a stress response to disseminated tumor.

This can be accomplished via lung biopsy. We typically perform TBBX first but surgical biopsy may be pursued in those in whom TBBX has failed to be diagnostic or in those in whom bronchoscopy is contraindicated. The cytologic demonstration of malignant cells on aspirated blood from a wedged pulmonary artery catheter is an alternative for those in whom a PAC is indicated for the diagnosis of PH or in those whom lung biopsy is considered too risky.

Prompt recognition is critical so that therapy can be initiated in a timely fashion. Although the syndromes overlap, pulmonary tumor embolism refers to the identification of tumor within pulmonary blood arterial vessels on pathologic lung samples whereas pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis refers to the identification of tumor in pulmonary lymphatic vessels. The causes are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67921\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67921 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4215590599\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations are nonspecific with the majority of patients presenting with subacute, progressive, unexplained dyspnea. Traditionally, it is thought that pulmonary tumor embolism is more likely to present with features suggestive of pulmonary hypertension or venous thromboembolism (eg, dyspnea, hypoxemia, right heart strain, and clear lungs) while pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis is more likely to present with the features of interstitial lung disease (eg, fever, bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging). However, clinical and pathological overlap between the entities is common. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3076536881\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect tumor emboli or lymphangitic carcinomatosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal diagnostic approach is unknown. Other than lung biopsy, most diagnostic tests are nonspecific but help to raise the clinical suspicion and prompt invasive testing. We suggest the following tests be performed in the routine evaluation of patients suspected a having either pulmonary tumor embolism or lymphangitic carcinomatosis: chest radiography, chest computed tomography (CT; including CT pulmonary angiography), ventilation-perfusion imaging, routine chemistries, arterial blood gas analysis, electrocardiography, and echocardiography (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1751614082\" class=\"local\">'Initial diagnostic tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional testing is aimed at a cytologic or histologic diagnosis. In general, many experts prefer to obtain a transbronchial lung biopsy (TBBX); if TBBX is negative and the clinical suspicion remains, or if TBBX is contraindicated, then proceeding with surgical lung biopsy is appropriate. Alternatively, aspiration of pulmonary artery blood using a right heart catheter may be appropriate as the initial test, particularly in those with suspected pulmonary hypertension or for those who are too ill to undergo lung biopsy; if negative, then proceeding to lung biopsy is appropriate for patients well enough to undergo biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H428631298\" class=\"local\">'Pursuing a histologic diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision about how aggressively to pursue the histologic diagnosis of pulmonary tumor embolism generally is individualized and depends upon the nature of the underlying tumor and likely success of treatment, the severity of illness, the presence or absence of pulmonary hypertension, goals and preferences of the patient, and the benefits and risks of each procedure in the context of its diagnostic yield. (See <a href=\"#H617336030\" class=\"local\">'Choosing among the tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major competing diagnoses are pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and interstitial lung disease. Pneumonia, heart failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and other embolization syndromes (amniotic, fluid, fat, foreign body) may also be considered on the differential. (See <a href=\"#H779306596\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive diagnosis of pulmonary tumor emboli or lymphangitic carcinomatosis is made histopathologically, most often on autopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107749\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107749 \">picture 1</a>). While definitive diagnosis is ideal, we acknowledge that there is a role for a presumptive diagnosis in patients who are too ill to undergo tissue sampling to justify anti-tumor therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive therapy is directed at treating the primary tumor. This may involve surgical resection, systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or any combination thereof.
