However, plasma aldosterone levels are low in these disorders, rather than elevated, as in primary aldosteronism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of these disorders has been elucidated. Summarized briefly, renal mineralocorticoid receptors bind aldosterone and cortisol with similar affinity. Although the plasma concentration of cortisol is approximately 100-fold higher than aldosterone, activation of mineralocorticoid receptors by cortisol is normally limited due to its conversion to inactive cortisone at the sites of aldosterone action by the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11-beta-HSD2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/apparent-mineralocorticoid-excess-syndromes-including-chronic-licorice-ingestion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This conversion is impaired in AME because of a mutation in the 11-beta-HSD2 gene and with licorice ingestion because of a compound in licorice (glycyrrhetinic acid) that inhibits the enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/apparent-mineralocorticoid-excess-syndromes-including-chronic-licorice-ingestion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p>By somewhat different mechanisms, hypersecretion of cortisol can also induce an excess mineralocorticoid state in patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/apparent-mineralocorticoid-excess-syndromes-including-chronic-licorice-ingestion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

AME is characterized by low birth weight, failure to thrive, onset of severe hypertension in early childhood with extensive target organ damage, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis from an unknown mechanism, and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/apparent-mineralocorticoid-excess-syndromes-including-chronic-licorice-ingestion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These manifestations are accompanied by all of the findings of primary aldosteronism (hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and low plasma renin activity) except for the low plasma aldosterone concentration. Affected patients may also have polyuria due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus that is presumably induced by the chronic hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/apparent-mineralocorticoid-excess-syndromes-including-chronic-licorice-ingestion/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>].

This effect is physiologically important, because cortisol binds as avidly as aldosterone to the mineralocorticoid receptor, and the plasma cortisol concentration is approximately 100-fold higher than the plasma aldosterone concentration.</p><p>Thus, cortisol would be the primary mineralocorticoid if it were not converted by 11-beta-HSD2 to cortisone at the aldosterone-sensitive sites.
