Some patients with peripheral SpA also have back pain or have had back pain in the past, but without the back pain being a predominant manifestation of their clinical syndrome.</p><p>Patients with peripheral SpA who have these findings in common include those with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), reactive arthritis, SpA related to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and the subset of patients with such manifestations who do not meet established definitions for these forms of SpA. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial SpA are not included within the peripheral SpA category, even if peripheral manifestations of musculoskeletal involvement are also present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>A clear distinction between the clinically defined subsets of patients with peripheral SpA is often lacking, other than for those with PsA. As examples, in a considerable number of patients skin manifestations of psoriasis do not occur until after the manifestation of rheumatic symptoms; preceding infections may be clinically asymptomatic, as an example, with Chlamydia; and IBD can also be asymptomatic when patients present with musculoskeletal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The treatment of peripheral SpA in adults will be presented here. An overview of the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peripheral SpA; the classification of SpA; and the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial SpA, PsA, reactive arthritis, arthritis associated with IBD, and SpA in children are discussed in more detail separately.

(See <a href=\"#H3195946238\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic and preventive therapies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2013713333\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3767323463\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Most patients benefit from care by an expert in rheumatologic disease, such as a rheumatologist, and care should be coordinated with appropriate specialists depending upon the clinical features, such as a dermatologist for psoriasis, gastroenterologist for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or an expert in uveitis.</p><p>There are relatively limited data that directly address the treatment of peripheral SpA, and indirect evidence to inform treatment approaches is largely derived from the growing amount of trials performed in psoriatic arthritis (PsA). However, randomized trials in PsA have largely been conducted in patients with polyarthritis, which is a disease pattern that is not typical for most patients with peripheral SpA; additional limited evidence comes from trials in patients with axial SpA. Thus, many of the approaches to management in patients with peripheral SpA are best supported by evidence from subgroup analyses of responses of patients with ankylosing spondylitis or PsA who also experience typical peripheral SpA manifestations, such as enthesitis and dactylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>An overview of our approach to the management of peripheral SpA is provided here. The treatments of peripheral SpA specifically within the context of PsA, IBD (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis), and reactive arthritis are described in more detail separately.

Smoking cessation should be advised because cigarette smoking is generally believed to have an adverse effect on SpA, in addition to its adverse effects upon cardiovascular risk and other aspects of health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients may also benefit from screening for depression, participation in patient support groups, and arthritis self-help programs.

Preventive measures (eg, screening for latent tuberculosis, administration of immunizations) that are appropriate for the individual medications being used are important components of treatment for all patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2013713333\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Choice of therapy is based upon the selection of agents that will be effective alone or in combination for the clinical manifestations that are present in a given patient. Most of the treatments for the different clinical manifestations overlap, but some are more effective for one or another feature. Treatment choices, particularly the use of biologic therapies, such as a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, may also be influenced by the presence of findings of another disease associated with peripheral SpA that may require one of these agents, such as psoriasis, IBD, and uveitis.

Patients with a limited number of swollen joints amenable to arthrocentesis and joint injection may benefit from intraarticular glucocorticoid injections. In patients with arthritis of greater severity, a low to moderate dose of daily oral glucocorticoids can be used; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in doses of up to 10 mg daily may be adequate and well-tolerated if treatment is not prolonged, but doses up to 30 mg daily for a short period may be required in some patients to achieve a clinically significant reduction in disease activity. Such oral glucocorticoid therapy may be used as bridging therapy until symptoms are adequately controlled with NSAIDs or further therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3996040588\"><span class=\"h3\">Resistant to initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients without an adequate response to initial therapy should undergo a trial of a nonbiologic DMARD, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ; 2 to 3 g daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX; up to 25 mg once weekly), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> (LEF; 20 mg daily). The choice of agent depends upon comorbidities and clinician and patient preference. Such patients include those who have active arthritis despite trials of two different NSAIDs; those with recurrent disease activity following intraarticular glucocorticoids, despite ongoing NSAIDs; and patients who require sustained therapy with moderate- or higher-dose glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at greater than 5 to 7.5 mg daily); as well as patients with NSAID intolerance.</p><p>A trial with any one of these drugs usually lasts at least three months. The precautions, dosing, and adverse effects of these agents when used for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis are described in detail separately.

TNF inhibitors are also effective for the treatment of concomitant flares of anterior uveitis, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> are preferred over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Biologic agents are usually not required in patients with reactive arthritis because the condition is self-limited in most patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>TNF inhibitors and other biologic DMARDs have proven beneficial in multiple randomized trials for peripheral arthritis in PsA, as described in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>). In addition, two randomized trials have shown significantly benefit with the TNF inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, in patients with non-psoriatic peripheral SpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In one trial involving 165 patients with active non-psoriatic peripheral SpA (by Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society [ASAS] criteria) and an inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs, adalimumab (40 mg every two weeks) was significantly more likely compared with placebo to result in at least 40 percent improvement in a composite clinical endpoint at 12 weeks (39 versus 20 percent of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similarly, in a randomized trial involving a total of only 40 patients, significant benefit with adalimumab, compared with placebo, was also demonstrated by several indices after 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; the discontinuation of the TNF inhibitor after 12 or 24 weeks resulted in a relapse in 73 percent of patients within 16 weeks (mean of 10 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Use of TNF inhibitors would be considered as &ldquo;off-label&rdquo; in the United States, unless patients also had active axial SpA, psoriasis, or active IBD, which are among the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indications for these agents.</p><p>The interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secukinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secukinumab</a> is available in the United States and Europe for treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. Using composite indices as measures of outcome, secukinumab use resulted in significant improvement in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. However, there is insufficient information available regarding its effect on peripheral SpA itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3674731149\"><span class=\"h2\">Enthesitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with enthesitis, such as Achilles tendinopathy or plantar fasciitis, we use an NSAID as the initial therapeutic agent. Conventional synthetic DMARDs are commonly ineffective for this manifestation, and enthesitis that is resistant to treatment with NSAIDs and conventional nonbiologic DMARDS is usually associated with arthritis that is also resistant to such agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,13</a>]; such patients may thus require a biologic agent for their arthritis, which can be of benefit for resistant enthesitis. In patients in whom treatment with NSAIDs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local glucocorticoid injections are inadequate, we use a biologic agent, usually a TNF inhibitor, based upon the available but limited randomized trial data, clinical experience, and expert opinion as reflected in recommendations for the management of PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>One randomized trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> in patients with non-psoriatic peripheral SpA found that adalimumab was superior to placebo in decreasing the enthesitis count, a clinical measure based upon the number of sites exhibiting enthesitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Another randomized trial investigated the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, compared with placebo, on heel enthesitis (confirmed by inflammation seen on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) over 12 weeks of treatment in patients with peripheral SpA, including patients with psoriasis, and showed superiority of etanercept over placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a 2014 systematic review of treatments for enthesitis in patients with PsA, SSZ was noted not to be effective, and neither MTX nor local injections of glucocorticoids were found to have been studied adequately. Significant benefit was reported in trials of several TNF inhibitors, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=golimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">golimumab</a>, and certolizumab. Another biologic agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>, the <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-12/23</span> inhibitor used in psoriasis, has also been found to be beneficial for enthesitis associated with psoriasis and PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3576222611\"><span class=\"h2\">Dactylitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the uncommon patient with dactylitis, we use NSAIDs as initial therapy. Dactylitis usually becomes less painful with time, and we would generally not use a biologic agent for dactylitis alone. In those patients with dactylitis who require treatment, we use a biologic agent such as a TNF inhibitor rather than a conventional nonbiologic DMARD. An alternative to a TNF inhibitor is the <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-12/23</span> inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>, but there is less experience with this medication.</p><p>The best evidence, although limited, regarding treatment of dactylitis is from trials in patients with PsA. In a systematic review of dactylitis associated with psoriatic arthritis, SSZ and LEF were noted to be ineffective, while several biologic agents, including the TNF inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> and certolizumab, and the <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-12/23</span> inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>, were found to be likely to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3220003357\"><span class=\"h2\">Axial manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAIDs should be used as first-line treatment for axial SpA.

Clinical assessment should include a focused history and examination directed at the patient&rsquo;s known manifestations and screening for other features associated with peripheral SpA. Because of the paucity of information regarding long-term outcomes in patients with peripheral SpA (see <a href=\"#H3260388241\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below), patients should be monitored carefully for signs of the development of psoriasis, Crohn <span class=\"nowrap\">disease/ulcerative</span> colitis, axial SpA, and the diseases included in the differential diagnosis of peripheral SpA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults#H61262047\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peripheral spondyloarthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults#H89275982\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peripheral spondyloarthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Peripheral SpA subgroups'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis-in-adults#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peripheral spondyloarthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Unlike axial SpA, there are no validated indices for monitoring disease activity in peripheral SpA. However, investigators participating in a clinical trial developed an index which consisted of a patient global assessment of disease activity, patient global assessment of pain, the number of swollen joints, number of tender joints, an enthesitis count, and a dactylitis count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18</a>].

There is a paucity of information regarding the prognosis of patients with peripheral SpA that is not associated with one of these three conditions.</p><p>Peripheral SpA is often a chronic disease, although there are probably more spontaneous remissions in patients with peripheral SpA than with axial SpA. Among 165 patients with active peripheral SpA enrolled in a clinical trial of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, and who had not responded adequately to either nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), the mean duration of disease at the time of the trial was six to eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. More long-term data are needed. For patients whose disease activity is suppressed by the TNF inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, discontinuation of adalimumab after 12 or 24 weeks of therapy will usually lead to a relapse within two to three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-peripheral-spondyloarthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Some evidence also suggests that patients with SpA, including peripheral SpA, may be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly in association with chronic disease that is poorly controlled. This has best been shown in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and results in patients with ankylosing spondylitis are more uncertain.

Patients benefit from care by an expert in rheumatologic disease, such as a rheumatologist, and care should be coordinated with appropriate specialists (eg, dermatologists in patients with psoriatic arthritis [PsA]), depending upon the other clinical features that are present (see <a href=\"#H743388021\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choice of therapy is based upon the selection of agents that will be effective alone or in combination for the clinical manifestations that are present in a given patient. A clear distinction between the clinically defined subsets of patients with peripheral SpA is often lacking, and similar approaches to management are used for patients with peripheral SpA associated with specific disorders (eg, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]), with axial SpA, or without clinical evidence of another specific disorder. The specific management strategies for peripheral SpA in the context of psoriatic arthritis, IBD (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis), and reactive arthritis are described in more detail separately.

Patients with a limited number of swollen joints amenable to arthrocentesis and joint injection may benefit from intraarticular glucocorticoid injections. In patients in whom these measures are inadequate to control the arthritis, we use a low to moderate dose of daily oral glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> up to 10 mg daily) but avoid prolonged treatment; short courses of doses up to 30 mg daily may be required in some patients. Such oral glucocorticoid therapy may be used as bridging therapy until symptoms are adequately controlled with NSAIDs or further therapy (see <a href=\"#H1016889592\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with arthritis that responds inadequately to NSAIDs, intraarticular glucocorticoids, and low dose oral glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> &le;5 to 7.5 mg daily), we suggest a nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ; 2 to 3 g daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX; up to 25 mg once weekly), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> (LEF; 20 mg daily) rather than a biologic DMARD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The choice of agent depends upon comorbidities and clinician and patient preference (see <a href=\"#H3996040588\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to initial therapy'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with peripheral arthritis resistant to nonbiologic DMARD therapy (after trials of either one or two agents, depending upon regulatory and payor requirements), we switch to a biologic DMARD. We generally prefer one of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, certolizumab, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=golimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">golimumab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, used in the same doses as in other forms of spondyloarthritis) as the initial therapeutic agent in this setting (see <a href=\"#H1154184605\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to nonbiologic DMARD'</a> above). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with enthesitis, such as Achilles tendinopathy or plantar fasciitis, we use an NSAID as the initial therapeutic agent. In patients in whom treatment with NSAIDs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> local glucocorticoid injections is inadequate, we use a biologic agent, usually a TNF inhibitor (as in patients with arthritis) rather than a nonbiologic DMARD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An alternative to a TNF inhibitor is the interleukin <span class=\"nowrap\">(IL)-12/23</span> inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

In patients who require treatment for persistent dactylitis resistant to NSAIDs and who need a DMARD for the management of other disease manifestations, we suggest treatment with a biologic DMARD, usually a TNF inhibitor (as in patients with arthritis) rather than a conventional nonbiologic DMARD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An alternative to a TNF inhibitor is the <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-12/23</span> inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>, with which there is less experience, but which is being used for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.
