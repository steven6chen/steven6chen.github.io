RBC transfusions may reduce the morbidity associated with chronic anemia, such as the anemia of prematurity, and can be lifesaving in neonates with severe blood loss.</p><p>The indications for neonatal RBC transfusions and the selection of the proper blood product will be reviewed here. Anemia of prematurity and indications for red cell transfusion in infants and children are discussed separately.

Signs include increased resting heart rate, acidosis, poor growth, decreased energy to nipple feed, apnea, and increased need for respiratory support.</p><p>Oxygen supply to tissues is defined as the product of cardiac output and arterial oxygen content. The arterial oxygen content is dependent upon the hemoglobin concentration, arterial oxygen saturation, oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin (1.34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/gm</span> hemoglobin), and, to a minor extent, the solubility of oxygen. Oxygen supply is increased by increasing cardiac output, arterial oxygen saturation, or hemoglobin concentration.</p><p>The indications for neonatal RBC transfusions differ based upon the rate of fall in hemoglobin (acute versus chronic anemia). The need for transfusion in an infant with acute blood loss is generally dependent upon persistent clinical signs of inadequate oxygen delivery following intravascular volume restoration. In chronic anemia, the need for RBC transfusion is, likewise, based upon clinical signs of inadequate oxygen delivery (such as increased resting heart rate, acidosis, poor growth, and apnea) and the degree of respiratory support needed by the infant. Although target hemoglobin and hematocrit (HCT) (values below which a RBC transfusion is administered) have been used as clinical indicators for RBC transfusion, it remains uncertain what target HCT or hemoglobin will optimally balance the risk and benefits of this intervention.</p><p>Transfusions are a temporary measure and have the disadvantages of further inhibiting erythropoiesis and being associated with risks of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], graft-versus-host disease, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), and toxic effects of anticoagulants or preservatives. RBC transfusions have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of death, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), extension of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), or transient increase in respiratory support; however, high quality evidence for a causal relationship with any of these adverse events is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. These potential complications underscore the need to carefully evaluate a neonate's ability to deliver oxygen to tissues prior to ordering a nonemergent transfusion, and to document benefit following the transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns#H31669350\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns&quot;, section on 'Anemia and RBC transfusion'</a>.)</p><p>One of the major challenges in deciding when to transfuse is distinguishing the neonate who is anemic and requires an RBC transfusion from one who has adapted to a low HCT, and is best treated conservatively to avoid the associated risks of transfusion.</p><p>Determining optimal HCT levels for neonates and young infants has been an active area of investigation. Various factors influence the threshold, including acuity of blood loss, gestational age, need for respiratory support, or if the infant will undergo major surgery within 72 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73361\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73361 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The diagnostic approach to anemia in newborns is discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101423\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101423 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-anemia#H97174663\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with anemia&quot;, section on 'Age of patient'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute blood loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates with significant acute blood loss require immediate fluid resuscitation, but may or may not require a RBC transfusion. For example, some term infants may tolerate perinatal blood loss up to one-third of their total blood volume. Infants with a hemoglobin level &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">gm/dL</span> following volume expansion may have adequate oxygen delivery and generally only require iron supplementation to replace iron losses due to the hemorrhage.</p><p>Indications for a RBC transfusion in a term or preterm neonate after volume resuscitation with restoration of the effective circulating volume following an acute blood loss include one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&gt;20 percent blood loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10 to 20 percent blood with evidence of inadequate oxygen delivery, such as persistent acidosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ongoing hemorrhage</p><p/><p>Percent of external blood loss is usually determined by dividing the volume of blood loss (measuring the difference in weight of bandages, gauze, and blankets before and after surgery [blood soaked]) by the volume of the infant's total blood volume (85 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span>. However, internal blood loss is more difficult to estimate; some calculations have been determined based on clinical context. For example, the volume loss due to a subgaleal hemorrhage can be estimated at 38 mL for every 1 cm increase in head circumference.</p><p>Prior to transfusion, it is critical to determine whether a significantly low HCT of an infant at birth is due to an acute fall near the time of delivery or to a chronic in utero process, because this may alter the type of transfusion administered (ie, simple versus exchange). For example, in twin-twin transfusion syndrome or feto-maternal hemorrhage, the degree and timing of bleeding is variable. Bleeding may occur just before delivery or might have begun in the second trimester and be long-standing at the time of delivery, both of which may result in a HCT below 20 percent at birth. In the latter case, a partial exchange transfusion should be considered in an infant in whom an increase in tissue oxygen delivery is necessary. A simple transfusion may cause a significant increase in blood volume, resulting in heart failure, because these infants often have elevated circulating blood volumes. Exchange transfusions should be considered in infants with severe hemolytic anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn#H1826932948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal diagnosis and management of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn&quot;, section on 'Postnatal management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All newborn infants have a gradual fall in their HCT after birth due to decreased production of erythropoietin (EPO), referred to as physiologic anemia. In preterm infants, this decline occurs earlier and is more pronounced in its severity than in term infants. This hyporegenerative anemia associated with low EPO concentrations is defined as anemia of prematurity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-prematurity#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of prematurity&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, infants cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are at risk for developing chronic anemia because of blood loss from phlebotomy. This is especially true for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW &lt;1500 g) who are often more severely ill and require frequent blood tests, and who have a lower total volume of blood than more mature, larger neonates. In addition, RBCs in preterm infants have a reduced life span compared with full term infants, which contributes to the anemia of prematurity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Target hemoglobin or hematocrit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It remains unclear what the minimal target HCT or hemoglobin is in neonates that optimally balances the risk and benefits of transfusion. A restrictive (low) transfusion threshold compared with a liberal (high) threshold (HCT greater than 40 percent) results in less exposure to transfusions with no increase in mortality or serious morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/6-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-17</a>]. We use a restrictive approach for neonatal transfusions that is based upon HCT triggers and the respiratory support required by the infant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73361\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73361 \">table 1</a>). This approach is supported by randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses.</p><p>In a 2011 meta-analysis based on four trials with 614 infants, the following outcomes were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants in the low hemoglobin threshold group received fewer transfusions than those in the high hemoglobin threshold group, and donor exposures per infant were also lower in the low hemoglobin threshold group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants in the low threshold group were transfused at a later age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no difference in the rate of mortality between the low and high hemoglobin threshold groups (relative risk [RR] 1.23, 95% CI 0.86-1.76).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no difference in the composite outcome of death and serious morbidity at the time of discharge, defined as severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or brain injury on ultrasound (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.96-1.2). In a separate analysis, there was also no difference in the composite outcome of death and severe brain injury at hospital discharge (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.81-1.55).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial (The Premature Infants in Need of Transfusion [PINT] Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]), there was no difference between the low and high target HCT groups at 18 to 21 months corrected age in the composite outcome of death or neurodevelopment impairment, defined as cerebral palsy (CP), significant visual and hearing impairment, and a Bayley Scales of Infant Development II Mental Development Index (MDI) score &lt;70 (45 versus 39 percent, odds ratio [OR] 1.45, 95% CI 0.94-2.21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a post-hoc analysis, MDI score &lt;85 was more likely in the low HCT group compared with the high HCT group (45 versus 34 percent, adjusted OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.12-2.93). Of note, this was the largest trial and accounted for 73 percent of the patients in the meta-analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no significant differences for survivors in secondary outcomes including ROP, brain injury based on ultrasonography, BPD, neurosensory impairment at 18 to 21 months of corrected age, apnea requiring intervention, difference in weight gain, length of hospitalization, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and NEC.</p><p/><p>There was a fair degree of heterogeneity, as the trials differed in the high hemoglobin target thresholds (although the low thresholds were similar) and the BW of the enrolled infants. It should be noted that in three of the trials that included almost all of the patients (n = 580 patients), EPO was not given. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that the restrictive (low) transfusion thresholds compared with a liberal (high) threshold resulted in modest reductions in exposure to transfusions, and there were no differences in mortality, major morbidities, and serious neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 21 months corrected age. Because the low thresholds were similar amongst the four trials, the authors recommended the following lower levels of hemoglobin <span class=\"nowrap\">(g/dL)</span> based on the patient age and requirement for respiratory support:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Week 1</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With respiratory support &ndash; 11.5</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No respiratory support &ndash; 10</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Week 2</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With respiratory support &ndash; 10</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No respiratory support &ndash; 8.5</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Week 3</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With respiratory support &ndash; 8.5</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No respiratory support &ndash; 7.5</p><p/><p>A 2012 meta-analysis that included two additional trials that did not meet inclusion criteria for the above study reported similar findings of no difference in mortality rates between high and low threshold transfusion groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a long-term follow-up study, cognitive function based on developmental assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome were better in the low HCT target group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In addition, a systematic review of the literature that included both randomized clinical trials and nonrandomized studies reported no differences in harmful outcomes (eg, mortality, NEC, BPD, IVH or retinopathy of prematurity) between restrictive and liberal transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In developed countries, the number of transfusions given to neonates has decreased from an average of seven transfusions in the late 1980s to two transfusions per infant in 2009 during their initial birth hospitalization due to a more restrictive approach to transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Despite this decrease, most extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants still receive at least one blood transfusion. In the above meta-analysis, only 11 percent of infants in the low-threshold group and 9 percent in the high-threshold group received no transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In a study of neonates undergoing non-cardiac surgery based on data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, multiple regression analysis demonstrated that preoperative HCT was an independent risk factor for mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H676623221\"><span class=\"h3\">Erythropoietin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants who receive appropriate and timely doses of EPO or darbepoetin (a long-acting EPO) therapy require fewer transfusions and are exposed to fewer donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Ongoing studies are evaluating dosing and dosing schedules to maximize increases in red cell mass. However, guidelines published from some organizations, for example, the 2016 guidelines of the British Committee for Standards in Haematology do not recommend the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of the literature reported that early administration of erythropoietin (before 8 days of life) reduced the number of RBC transfusions by one or more, reduced the total volume of transfused blood, and reduced donor exposure in preterm infants with a birth weight &lt;2500 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Infants often require exchange transfusion to remove the maternal alloantibodies, reduce the rate of hemolysis, and prevent significant hyperbilirubinemia. In some cases, a simple transfusion is administered because an exchange transfusion cannot be done in a timely manner. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-hemolytic-disease-of-the-fetus-and-newborn#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal diagnosis and management of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn&quot;, section on 'Antenatal management'</a>.)</p><p>The different types of HDFN include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F97838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97838 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhesus D (Rh(D)) &ndash; The most significant setup for HDFN occurs in the Rh-positive infant (ie, D antigen positive) of an Rh-negative mother who has become sensitized and has produced Rh(D) antibodies. An infant who needs either simple transfusion or exchange transfusion because of HDFN should receive Rh(D)-negative red cells of the appropriate ABO type.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ABO incompatibility &ndash; Humans have four major blood groups in the ABO system (A, B, AB, and O) named for the antigen(s) on the red cell. The ABO system may cause HDFN, although most cases are less severe than that caused by D antigen isoimmunization. In infants with HDFN due to ABO incompatibility, donor O cells are washed to remove any plasma that contains alloantibodies. These cells may be suspended in plasma that is compatible with both the infant's red cells and the transfused (donor) cells. AB plasma is compatible in all cases, since it does not contain anti-A or anti-B alloantibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other Rh antibodies &ndash; Other antibodies including Rh antibodies in the C and E systems, and Kell antibodies can cause HDFN or acute or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction. In these cases, red cells that are negative for the antigen, against which the antibody is directed, are used.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Red blood cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RBCs are used for replacement during surgery, RBC loss, and sporadic transfusion therapy. The hematocrit (HCT) of the unit varies depending upon the preservative solution. In the United States, commonly used solutions include CPDA-1 (citrate, phosphate, dextrose, adenine) with a HCT of 65 to 70 percent, and nutrient preparations, such as Adsol (AS-1; adenine, glucose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a>, and sodium chloride) and Nutricel (AS-2; citrate, phosphate, glucose, adenine, and sodium chloride), with a HCT of 50 to 60 percent. RBCs in the nutrient solutions (AS-1 and AS-2) can be used for up to 42 days after collection, and those preserved in CPDA-1 for up to 28 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].

However, a Canadian multicenter trial of preterm infants (birth weight [BW] &lt;1250 g) demonstrated no benefit in the use of fresh RBC (stored for seven days or less) transfusion compared with transfusions using RBCs stored under standard blood bank practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Specifically, there was no difference in the primary composite outcome of major neonatal morbidities that included necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) between groups of infants who received fresh RBCs (mean age of RBCs, 5.1 &plusmn; 2.1 days) and those administered standard transfusions (mean age of RBCs, 14.6 &plusmn; 8.3 days). Infants in the fresh RBC group were exposed to a greater number of donors compared with the standard RBC group (3.7 &plusmn; 2.7 donors versus 2.1 &plusmn; 1.6 donors). These findings show that no alteration for the standard RBCs storage time practices is needed for preterm infants of neonatal RBC transfused products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Leukoreduced and irradiated red cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leukoreduction filters remove approximately 99.9 percent of white blood cells from packed red blood cells (PRBCs), which reduces febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, prevents alloimmunization, and reduces (but does not completely prevent) the transmission of certain infections (notably cytomegalovirus [CMV]). However, leukoreduction does not eliminate all lymphocytes and cannot prevent transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD).</p><p>Irradiation prevents TA-GVHD in susceptible recipients.

Even with a program that collects and processes umbilical cord blood, autologous blood was only available in one-third of neonates that required transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Although the collection of cord blood for autologous transfusion in neonates requires further study, the use of cord blood for initial blood tests can be easily instituted. In one study, the use of cord blood for initial laboratory evaluation resulted in an increased initial HCT at 12 to 24 hours after birth, and decreased the rate of early transfusions and vasopressors in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW &lt;1500 g) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Another method that may reduce erythrocyte transfusions is delayed clamping of the umbilical cord, especially in preterm infants.

Transfusions generally are given as packed red blood cells (PRBCs), in aliquots of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> over two to four hours. In some circumstances, such as hemodynamic instability or hypovolemia due to blood loss, a smaller volume (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> is given more rapidly (over one to two hours). Data are inconclusive regarding the optimal volume for neonatal PRBC transfusion. In a systematic review of the literature, there were only four trials with 146 infants that compared transfusion volumes of 10 versus 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although there were no reports of difference in neonatal outcomes including mortality, the number of patients is too small to reach any definitive conclusion regarding choice of aliquot volume for PRBC transfusion.</p><p>In extremely low birth weight (ELBW) and VLBW infants, the small volumes, which may be as low as 7 mL of blood for a single transfusion, require the use of special equipment to maximize the use of a single unit from a donor. In addition, these systems allow for serial transfusions to an individual neonate from the same donor.</p><p>These include the following two systems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small bags may come as part of a transfusion set (referred to as satellite packs) in which four or six aliquots can be made from a single red cell unit. If the blood bank has a sterile connecting device, the small bags can be connected to the large blood unit, and an appropriate amount withdrawn at any time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another convenient device for small-volume transfusions is a syringe set in which the syringe is sterilely connected to the original unit. Blood is drawn through a filter into a syringe, and can be used within four hours without further filtration. Such systems have been shown to be safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] and can increase the number of transfusions from a single unit.</p><p/><p>With both systems, the original expiration date of the unit is maintained if the sampling device remains connected to the original unit in a sterile manner. This period may be up to six weeks for use of a single unit in a nutrient solution such as Adsol (AS-1) and Nutricel (AS-2). If a single unit is designated for a premature infant and is used until its expiration date, as many as 13 individual transfusions can be made from a single donor unit, which markedly decreases donor exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anemia occurs when the red blood cell (RBC) mass does not adequately meet the oxygen demands of tissues. Neonates may require RBC transfusions because of significant anemia due to acute blood loss or chronic anemia due to physiologic anemia and blood loss from phlebotomy. In particular, anemia in preterm infants (referred to as anemia of prematurity) is more severe and presents earlier in life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-prematurity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of prematurity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonates with significant acute blood loss require immediate fluid resuscitation. Indications for RBC transfusion in a neonate with acute blood loss following volume resuscitation include persistent acidosis indicating inadequate oxygen delivery, ongoing bleeding, and an estimated blood loss greater than 20 percent of the infant's blood volume. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Acute blood loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the acute setting of blood loss, especially in life-threatening circumstances, any available RBC product that is compatible with the infant's blood type can be administered. O-negative whole blood should not be used as it contains antibodies directed against A or B blood group, and leukocytes. O-negative whole blood should only be used as a last resort in critically ill neonates. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Products for acute life-threatening blood loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Target hemoglobin and hematocrit have been used universally as clinical indicators for RBC transfusion in neonates due to chronic anemia. However, it remains unclear what the minimal target hematocrit (HCT) or hemoglobin is in neonates that optimally balances the risk and benefits of transfusion. Based on the available data, it appears that a restrictive approach results in fewer transfusions and does not increase the risk of death or serious morbidity. In our practice, we use a restrictive approach for neonatal transfusions that is based upon HCT triggers and the respiratory support required by the infant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73361\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73361 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Target hemoglobin or hematocrit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood products for neonates with hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) who require either exchange or simple transfusion need to be compatible with the infant's blood type. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hemolytic disease of the newborn'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that leukoreduced packed red blood cells (PRBCs) should be used in all neonatal transfusions because it reduces febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, prevents alloimmunization, and reduces the transmission of certain infections (notably cytomegalovirus [CMV]) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Most neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) also use irradiated RBCs, which do not provide a CMV-safe product, but prevent transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host disease. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Leukoreduced and irradiated red cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMV-seronegative PRBCs reduce the transmission of CMV in seronegative recipients. We suggest that CMV-seronegative PRBCs be used for all neonates (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We recommend the use of CMV-seronegative PRBCs for immunodeficient neonates, those who are awaiting transplantation, and preterm infants of seronegative mothers (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'CMV-safe red cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the neonate, transfusions generally are given as packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in aliquots of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> over two to four hours. In some circumstances, such as hemodynamic instability or hypovolemia due to blood loss, a smaller volume (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> is given more rapidly (over one to two hours). In extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (BW &lt;1000 g) small volumes may require the use of special equipment that allows several aliquots to be administered from a single unit.
