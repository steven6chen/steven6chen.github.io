The lack of evidence does not necessarily mean that screening is not beneficial, only that it has not yet been adequately tested.</p><p>When deciding whether screening should be performed, the potential benefits and harms of screening must be considered. The balance between risks and benefits varies depending upon the condition, the clinical circumstances of the child and family, the availability of resources, and the values that patients (or patients' caregivers) place on the potential benefits and harms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-tests-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>For many conditions, screening is regulated by local, state, or federal policies.
