These mediators can be divided into three overlapping categories: preformed mediators, newly synthesized lipid mediators, and cytokines and chemokines.</p><p>This topic will review mast cell mediators. The information in this topic pertains to human mast cells whenever possible, and notation is made when data are derived purely from murine studies. The development, physiologic roles, surface receptors, and signal transduction of mast cells are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Development, identification, and physiologic roles&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Surface receptors and signal transduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREFORMED MEDIATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cell secretory granules contain preformed mediators that are rapidly (within seconds to minutes) released into the extracellular environment upon cell stimulation. These mediators include histamine, neutral proteases, proteoglycans, and some cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). They are responsible for many of the acute signs and symptoms of mast cell-mediated allergic reactions, including edema, bronchoconstriction, and increased vascular permeability. Specific pharmacotherapy to inhibit <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antagonize mast cell mediators is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic mastocytosis: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Pharmacotherapy for symptoms related to mast cell mediators'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Histamine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histamine is produced predominantly by mast cells but also is elaborated by basophils, neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and platelets. It is stored in both scroll-like and lattice secretory granules of the human mast cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Human cutaneous mast cells are estimated to contain 1.9 micrograms of histamine per 10<sup>6</sup> cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Secretory granule exocytosis and release of histamine occurs rapidly after either immunoglobulin E (IgE)- or non-IgE-based stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The effects of histamine are mediated through H1, H2, H3, and H4 receptors located on target cells:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H1-mediated actions include increased venular permeability, bronchial and intestinal smooth muscle contraction, increased nasal mucus production, widened pulse pressure, increased heart rate and cardiac output, flushing, and T cell neutrophil and eosinophil chemotaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In mice, lack of H1 receptors leads to reduced lung inflammation as a consequence of the decreased T cell influx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effects mediated through the H2 receptor include increased venular permeability, increased gastric acid secretion, and airway mucus production but inhibition of neutrophil and eosinophil influx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An H3 receptor has been located in the brain, as well as on sympathetic nerve fibers innervating blood vessels in the nasal mucosa and heart, although its precise role is not fully characterized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An H4 receptor has been identified and cloned in both mice and humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This receptor modulates T helper type 2 (Th2) responses, and H4-deficient mice have decreased lung inflammation with less infiltration of eosinophils and lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Acting through the H4 receptor, histamine can act as a chemoattractant for mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells and modulate calcium influx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In humans, the actions of histamine at the H4 receptor provide a potent chemotactic pathway for human eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Serotonin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human mast cells produce the biogenic amine serotonin during fetal development and possibly under some conditions in adult life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Human fetal periodental mast cells produce and store serotonin in high amounts, coinciding with the appearance of enameloblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Proteoglycans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metachromatic staining of mast cell granules is due to sulfated, anionic proteoglycans, such as heparin and chondroitin sulfate. These are composed of a peptide core, serglycin, to which is added the complex glycosaminoglycans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Heparin may serve to stabilize the multimeric complex of histamine, proteoglycan, and active neutral proteases within the secretory granule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. With granule exocytosis, heparin retains many of the proteases in the macromolecular complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Heparin also functions as an anticoagulant, inhibits the complement cascade, and markedly potentiates the action of angiogenic factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-29</a>].</p><p>Chondroitin sulfate-E, a highly sulfated proteoglycan like heparin, has kinin pathway activation effects and protease-stabilizing functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Tryptases and other proteases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important mast cell proteases include the tryptases, chymases, cathepsin G, renin, and a mast cell-specific carboxypeptidase A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Tryptases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tryptases are the most abundant proteases of the human mast cell, comprising up to 20 percent of the cell protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/3,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31,32</a>]. Some human mast cells contain up to 35 micrograms of <span class=\"nowrap\">tryptase/10<sup>6</sup></span> cells, which is a dramatically higher protease content than any other granulocyte. The other cell type that contains some tryptase, the basophil, has only very low levels (0.4 percent of the tryptase in mast cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, serum tryptase is a relatively specific marker of mast cell <span class=\"nowrap\">degranulation/activation</span>. The demonstration that a mast cell-mediated event has occurred is important in the diagnosis of mast cell disorders, anaphylaxis, and drug-allergic reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-disorders-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell disorders: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-acute-diagnosis#H4053318931\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Acute diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Laboratory tests'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-management#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, etiology, and management&quot;, section on 'Laboratory tests at the time of the reaction'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Two forms of tryptase are used clinically: Total tryptase and mature tryptase. Total tryptase levels are detectable in normal donors at serum levels of up to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and reflect total body mast cell content. Persistent elevations in total tryptase in excess of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> are indicative of systemic mastocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mastocytosis-cutaneous-and-systemic-evaluation-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mastocytosis (cutaneous and systemic): Evaluation and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By comparison, mature active tryptase is stored within the secretory granule and released only during exocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It requires the heparin proteoglycans for activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Serum levels of this form of tryptase are normally undetectable (&lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>. The normal ratio between total and mature tryptase is usually less than 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Mature tryptase serves as a useful marker of mast cell degranulation, as it is a product nearly exclusive to mast cells. Elevations of mature tryptase may be observed during acute anaphylactic events involving severe symptoms and hypotension, rising within 15 minutes and detectable by 30 to 60 minutes after the event. Elevations can persist for several hours, depending upon the magnitude of the initial rise and can be associated with elevations of total tryptases. Elevations in mature beta tryptase can be used to confirm the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, although levels might not rise during food-induced anaphylaxis, possibly reflecting differences in the pathophysiology of these forms of anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2440642450\"><span class=\"h4\">Functions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tryptases are serine-endopeptidases that exhibit trypsin-like activity and cleave after basic amino acid residues in the proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. They are cationic tetrameric proteins that form a macromolecular complex with heparin proteoglycan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These complexes are distinct from those containing chymase and carboxypeptidase, implying separate pathways of protease processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Tryptase has been shown to have many actions in vitro, although the relative importance of these remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These actions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inactivation of fibrinogen and inhibition of fibrinogenesis, with anticoagulant activity that exceeds that of heparin. Beta tryptase, which is enzymatically active upon release from granules, degrades the alpha chain of fibrinogen and prevents its activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].

Human mast cells also have PAR2 receptors, although further study in humans is needed.</p><p/><p>Several human mast cell phenotypes are delineated based upon the relative content of tryptase, chymase, and the mast cell-specific carboxypeptidase, CPA3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MCTC (mast cells containing tryptase and chymase) &ndash; Contain both tryptase (in the greatest amounts) and chymase (skin and intestinal submucosa) and are the predominant type of MC found in connective tissue locations like the skin and around blood vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MCT (mast cells containing tryptase) &ndash; Contain tryptase but little chymase (mucosal tissues) and are associated with inflammation and found mostly in mucosa in the lung and intestine.

However, it is not readily found in serum and thus is not a marker that can be used to identify mast cell activation, except within tissue sections. It is primarily localized within the MCTC subset in gut submucosa and in skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. Human foreskin mast cells are estimated to contain 16 micrograms of CPA per10<sup>6</sup> cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>This exopeptidase is functionally similar to pancreatic carboxypeptidase B, even though it is more similar to pancreatic carboxypeptidase A by amino acid sequence.

CPA3 functions to convert angiotensin I to angiotensin II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] and has been shown to degrade neuropeptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. It may also degrade some toxins, such as those in bee and snake venoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Chymase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The MCTC (and rare MCC) subpopulations of human mast cells contain the chymotrypsin-like serine endopeptidase chymase <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a second member of this gene family, cathepsin-G [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/51,53,55,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53,55,59</a>].

Thus, mast cells provide both renin and ACE activity through chymase, both of which activate the renin-angiotensin system. It remains unclear whether this mechanism represents a protective response or if it contributes to ischemia-reperfusion injuries and predisposes to cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">NEWLY SYNTHESIZED LIPID MEDIATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cells utilize membrane phospholipids as a source of arachidonic acid for the synthesis of prostaglandins (PG), leukotrienes (LT), and platelet-activating factor (PAF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. These inflammatory mediators are referred to as eicosanoids (ie, derived from arachidonic acid). The production of these mediators is initiated when phospholipase (PL) A2 enzymes release arachidonic acid from phospholipids. Arachidonate is converted to the intermediate 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) and then to the epoxide, LTA<sub>4</sub>, by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). Subsequent conversion into the cysteinyl leukotriene LTC<sub>4</sub> is achieved by LTC<sub>4</sub> synthase or to the dihydroxy leukotriene LTB<sub>4</sub> by LTA<sub>4</sub> hydrolase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Lipid mediators are formed de novo from membrane phospholipids after cell activation. In contrast to the preformed mediators, which are released immediately by exocytosis, lipid mediators appear more slowly, generally from 15 minutes to hours after activation, leading to their initial name of &quot;slow reactive substance of anaphylaxis&quot; (SRS-A). As a group, they are responsible for some of the signs and symptoms of allergic reactions, such as airflow obstruction, as well as leukocyte and dendritic cell recruitment. Not all degranulating stimuli will result in eicosanoid generation. Anaphylatoxins and neuropeptides activate mast cells in such a manner that minimal eicosanoids are produced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Prostaglandins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostaglandin D<sub>2</sub> (PGD<sub>2</sub>) is the principal prostaglandin produced by mast cells, and it has been recognized in bronchial or nasal secretions after allergen challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cell-derived-mediators/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].

They are responsible for many of the acute signs and symptoms of mast cell-mediated allergic reactions. These mediators include histamine, neutral proteases, heparin proteoglycans, and some cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Preformed mediators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following activation, mast cells use membrane phospholipids to synthesize additional eicosanoid mediators: Prostaglandins (PG), leukotrienes (LT), and platelet-activating factor (PAF). These mediators appear from 15 minutes to several hours after activation. Eicosanoids cause some of the symptoms of allergic reactions and are also important in cell recruitment and antigen presentation.
