(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical symptoms and signs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of pediatric multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>There are no clinical findings that are unique to MS, but some are highly characteristic of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63940\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63940 \">table 1</a>). Common symptoms and signs of MS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61789 \">table 2</a>) include sensory symptoms in limbs or face, unilateral visual loss, acute or subacute motor weakness, diplopia, gait disturbance and balance problems, Lhermitte sign (electric shock-like sensations that run down the back <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limbs upon flexion of the neck), vertigo, bladder problems, limb ataxia, acute transverse myelitis, and pain. The onset is often polysymptomatic. The typical patient presents as a young adult with two or more clinically distinct episodes of central nervous system dysfunction with at least partial resolution. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical symptoms and signs'</a>.)</p><p>The first presentation of MS is often a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). A CIS most often presents in adults or children with long tract <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs,</span> optic neuritis, or a brainstem, cerebellar, or spinal cord syndrome. In some children, and rarely in adults, MS may present with symptoms of encephalopathy (ie, headache, vomiting, seizure, or altered consciousness). In addition, the first attack of MS can resemble acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) on the basis of multifocal symptoms with encephalopathy in a minority of children, most of whom are &le;11 years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pediatric-multiple-sclerosis#H116553095\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of pediatric multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008275\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE PATTERN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The core MS phenotypes are those of relapsing and progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pattern and course of MS is further categorized into several clinical subtypes as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinically isolated syndromes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapsing-remitting MS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary progressive MS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary progressive MS</p><p/><p>In addition, these phenotypes are modified by assessments of disease activity and disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Disease activity is determined by clinical relapses or MRI evidence of contrast enhancing lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions. Disease progression is a process that is independently quantified from relapses, and is characteristic of primary and secondary progressive MS. Secondary progressive MS is preceded by relapsing-remitting MS, hence the designation of &quot;secondary.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605010272\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinically isolated syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is the first attack of a disease compatible with MS (eg, optic neuritis, brainstem syndromes, or transverse myelitis) that exhibits characteristics of inflammatory demyelination but has yet to fulfill MS diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The core requirement for the diagnosis of MS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>) is the objective demonstration of dissemination of central nervous system lesions in both space and time, based upon either clinical findings alone or a combination of clinical and MRI findings. In CIS there is no evidence of previous episodes of demyelination from the patient's medical history. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with CIS who have MRI lesions at baseline, the long-term (ie, &ge;10 years) likelihood of developing MS is &ge;60 percent. In patients with a CIS who have a normal baseline MRI, the long-term likelihood of developing MS is approximately 20 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Estimating the risk of progression to multiple sclerosis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are found to have lesions on an MRI done for symptoms not due to a first presentation of MS, such as trauma or depression, are said to have a radiographically isolated syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Radiologically isolated syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008281\"><span class=\"h2\">Relapsing-remitting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is characterized by clearly defined relapses with full recovery, or with sequelae and residual deficit upon recovery. There is minimal disease progression during the periods between disease relapses, though relapses themselves may leave severe residual disability. This type of MS accounts for approximately 85 to 90 percent of cases at onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The initial attack is a clinically isolated syndrome as discussed above, though patients may meet the formal definition of MS with a single clinical episode if their MRI reveals the simultaneous presence of enhancing and non-enhancing lesions. Most patients with RRMS will eventually enter a secondary progressive phase as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008287\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary progressive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is characterized by an initial RRMS disease course followed by gradual worsening with or without occasional relapses, minor remissions, and plateaus. However, there are no established criteria to determine when RRMS converts to SPMS; the diagnosis of SPMS is made retrospectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The transition from RRMS to SPMS usually occurs 10 to 20 years after disease onset. In one report, the median time from the first symptoms of MS (a clinically isolated syndrome) to the development of SPMS was 19 years, while the median time from MS diagnosis to SPMS was 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008293\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary progressive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is characterized by progressive accumulation of disability from disease onset with occasional plateaus, temporary minor improvements, or acute relapses still consistent with the definition. A diagnosis of PPMS is made exclusively on patient history, and there are no imaging or exam findings that distinguish PPMS from RRMS. PPMS represents about 10 percent of MS cases at disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The most common clinical presentation is a spinal cord syndrome with spastic paraparesis and no clear sensory level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Enhancing lesions may be seen on the MRI in patients with PPMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These patients have a more even sex distribution than RRMS, tend to have a later age of onset, and may have a worse prognosis for ultimate disability in comparison with patients who have RRMS.</p><p>The term progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis or PRMS, previously used to characterize patients who had progressive disease from onset and clear acute relapses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], is now obsolete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An acute attack in a patient with progressive disease from onset is now considered to be PPMS with active disease, whereas those with progressive disease from onset without acute attacks (relapses) are considered to have PPMS, not active but with progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008305\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE SEVERITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worsening of disability due to MS is highly variable (see <a href=\"#H605008317\" class=\"local\">'Rate of worsening'</a> below). The impact of MS varies according to a number of measures, including severity of signs and symptoms, frequency of relapses, rate of worsening, and residual disability. From a patient's perspective, worsening of disability over time is probably the most important issue in MS.</p><p>Most patients have relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) at onset, and the clinical course often evolves to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. Over time, the proportion of patients with RRMS falls steadily, so that only one-half are still relapsing by nine years from onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients with an initial RRMS course who have active disease tend over time to have incomplete recovery between attacks, and the level of disability begins to increase. Eventually, disability accumulates even in the absence of relapses and the clinical type converts to SPMS.</p><p>MS with onset after the age of 40 years is progressive in over 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>At the extreme ends of the severity spectrum, there are benign and malignant forms of MS (see <a href=\"#H605008329\" class=\"local\">'Benign MS'</a> below and <a href=\"#H605008335\" class=\"local\">'Malignant MS'</a> below). However, these designations, especially of benign MS, are always retrospective determinations that should be used cautiously, since the severity and activity of MS can change in significant and unpredictable ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008311\"><span class=\"h2\">Disability measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Kurtzke disability scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76465\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76465 \">table 3</a>), or DSS, and the expanded version known as the expanded disability status scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57639\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57639 \">table 4</a>) or EDSS, are commonly used indices of clinical disability in MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. These indices use numbers ranging from 0 for normal examination and function to 10 for death due to MS. The scales are nonlinear, with great emphasis on ambulation capabilities with scores above 4.</p><p>Most MS cohort studies have found bimodal distributions of EDSS scores, with peaks at values of 1 (no disability with minimal neurologic signs) and 6 (cane needed for walking). The time spent by a patient at a given level of disability varies with the score. The median time spent with a DSS score of 4 or 5 is 1.2 years, while the median time spent at DSS 1 is four years and at DSS 6 three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The EDSS is universally used in clinical trials, but it has a number of serious limitations. Inter- and intra-rater variations in scoring are common. EDSS scores of 4 and higher depend almost entirely on the ability to walk. Problems such as the development of dementia, visual loss, or hand weakness may pass undetected by the scoring. Additionally, not all increases in the EDSS score have an equal impact on a patient's life. As an example, a one point increase in the EDSS may mean the patient has developed a sign apparent only to the examining doctor, or it may mean the patient has transitioned from being able to walk with a walker to using a wheelchair. Thus, other outcome measures should be also be used and minor changes in the EDSS alone should not be over-interpreted.</p><p>One such alternative is the Patient-Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101833 \">table 5</a>), which utilizes patient-reported outcomes to derive a disability score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008317\"><span class=\"h2\">Rate of worsening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worsening of disability due to MS is highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], but accumulating evidence suggests that worsening in most patients with MS is slow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/5,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13-17</a>]. One of the largest longitudinal studies followed 2319 patients from British Columbia for 22,723 patient years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Disability scores were prospectively assigned in greater than 95 percent of the patients.</p><p>The following observations were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median time from disease onset to EDSS 6 (cane needed for walking) was 27.9 years; the median age from birth to EDSS 6 was 59 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A primary progressive course was associated with more rapid disease progression than a relapsing course, and was a risk factor in multivariate analysis for time to use of a cane (EDSS 6) from both MS onset (hazard ratio [HR] 2.90, 95% CI 2.39-3.52) and from birth (HR 2.68, 95% CI 2.20-3.26).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although men progressed more quickly than women from onset, both men and women required a cane at similar ages (58.8 and 60.1 years, respectively), and male sex was not associated with a worse outcome after controlling for other factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of onset symptoms (eg, motor, sensory, optic neuritis, cerebellar, ataxia, or brainstem) did not predict disease progression after controlling for other factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A younger age at onset was associated with slower progression, but patients older at onset were consistently older when they progressed to EDSS 6 than patients younger at onset (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71819\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71819 \">figure 1</a>). Similar results were found in a large epidemiology study from France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>Some earlier studies suggested that MS was more rapidly progressive. As an example, a 25-year follow-up study of 308 patients with MS published in 1993 found that 50 percent of the patients reached EDSS 6 within 16 years of onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In contrast, a prospective report from 2016 of 517 patients with MS who were managed at a single MS center found that only 11 percent of patients had reached an EDSS &ge;6 at a median of approximately 17 years after disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These data suggest but do not prove that disease-modifying therapies, first introduced in the 1990s, have led to improved long-term outcomes. While disease-modifying therapies are effective for reducing the frequency of relapses in patients with relapsing-remitting MS, it has been difficult to confirm that they alter the course of disability development, as discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-treatment-of-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disease-modifying treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605010944\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency of relapses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of relapses is highly variable. Summaries of many studies provide an average figure of 0.4 to 0.6 relapses per year. Relapses tend to be more frequent during the first years of the disease and wane in later years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Some data suggest that a high relapse frequency in the first two to five years following the diagnosis of MS is associated with increased risk of secondary progression and disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/4,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22,23</a>].</p><p>In a single center study that analyzed data from 2587 relapses occurring in 1078 patients during an average follow-up of 7.4 years, relapses causing permanent disability were rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Relapses were not associated with starting or stopping interferon treatment.</p><p>Relapses of MS may be more common after stressful life events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Perhaps the strongest evidence comes from a meta-analysis of 14 observational studies that found a significant association between stress and MS exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, patients may suffer from a recall bias, and the authors cautioned that the study does not offer absolute evidence of a causal association.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008323\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality due to MS is difficult to determine because of poor data collection and reporting. Nevertheless, the following reports illustrate that mortality is increased patients with MS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of large MS cohort registries assessing mortality found that, compared with the general healthy population, life expectancy in patients with MS was reduced by 7 to 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. One-half or more of the deaths among patients with MS were directly related to complications of MS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 12 studies, with data from over 28,000 patients with MS, found that the pooled all-cause standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 2.8 (95% CI 2.7-2.9). Compared with the general population, patients with MS had increased rates of death from infection and respiratory diseases, suicide, and cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008329\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign MS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign MS refers to disease in which the patient remains fully functional in all neurologic systems 15 years after the disease onset; it is always a retrospective diagnosis. Approximately 15 percent of patients with a single demyelinating event will never experience a second relapse, although the exact frequency of this benign form of disease is unknown since many of these individuals either never come to medical attention, or are lost to follow up after the initial event. Among patients in a population-based cohort study who had MS for 10 or more years, about 17 percent had minimal or no disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Autopsy studies have found a significant number of cases with CNS pathology consistent with MS but no documented clinical evidence of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. MRI studies of asymptomatic relatives of MS patients have discovered lesions consistent with demyelination in up to 15 percent of these relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The use of MRI may expand the spectrum of MS by detecting milder cases that previously were not included in prognosis studies. Prospective MRI studies are needed to determine if there are reliable imaging features that can distinguish benign MS from RRMS and progressive types of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>In our experience and that of most others, patients who have had a known benign course for 15 years will only rarely develop a more severe course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>]. However, evidence is conflicting, and some have found that patients with benign MS for 10 years still have a substantial risk of disease worsening and increased disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The range of evidence is illustrated by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one long-term cohort, only 8 percent of patients with mild disease (EDSS score 0 to 3) five years after diagnosis progressed to severe disease (EDSS score 6) by 10 years, and only 12 percent by 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar results were noted in a second cohort, 17 percent of whom had minimal or no disability (EDSS score of 2 or lower) at study onset despite a 10-year or longer history of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The longer the duration of MS and the lower the disability, the more likely the patient was to remain stable and not progress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, a cohort study of 169 patients with EDSS scores &le;3 at 10 years from MS onset found progression to EDSS scores of &ge;6 at 20 years after onset in 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The EDSS score at 10 years was the only independent predictor of score at 20 years.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008335\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignant MS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant MS, sometimes called aggressive MS, refers to disease with a rapid progressive course, leading to significant disability in multiple neurologic systems in a relatively short time after disease onset. In a single center study of 487 patients with MS that defined malignant MS by the need for assistance with ambulation (ie, an EDSS score &ge;6) within five years from symptom onset, a malignant course was observed in 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Using the same definition for one model of aggressive MS, a subsequent population-based study of over 4000 subjects with adult-onset MS identified an aggressive course in 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Common predictors for malignant MS in these studies were older age at onset and a progressive disease course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008341\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSTIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of factors have been identified as possible prognostic indicators in MS that may modify the disease course or predict exacerbations. However, none are established as reliable, and our ability to accurately predict outcome for individual patients with MS is quite limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008353\"><span class=\"h2\">Relapsing versus progressive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relapsing form of MS is generally associated with a better prognosis than progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>]. An observational natural history study found that irreversible disability occurred sooner in patients in whom the disease was progressive from the onset than in those in whom the onset was relapsing-remitting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Once irreversible disability occurred, however, the time course of progressive disability was similar in the two groups.</p><p>As previously discussed, there are data suggesting that most patients with relapsing MS will eventually enter a progressive phase of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>] where neurologic disability gradually worsens regardless of the presence or absence of superimposed attacks. The development of a progressive course may be the single most adverse factor that influences prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/8,19,41-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19,41-46</a>]. One study found that the progressive phase of MS appeared to be independent of relapses that occurred before or after the onset of relapse-free progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, disability in MS may be more dependent on patient age than on the initial course, whether relapsing or progressive from onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/18,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008359\"><span class=\"h2\">Early symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain types of MS symptoms at disease onset were once thought to predict a favorable (sensory symptoms, optic neuritis) or unfavorable (pyramidal, brainstem, and cerebellar symptoms) prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, subsequent data suggested that none of these onset symptoms were independent prognostic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/15,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,48</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review of 27 eligible studies published by May 2005 that evaluated patients with RRMS, bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bladder symptoms at onset were the only symptoms that had strong and consistent associations with poor prognosis. Additional factors that predicted long-term disability in those with RRMS were incomplete recovery from the first attack, a short interval between the first and second attack, and early accumulation of disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>An observational study found that early clinical variables predicted time to disability defined as an EDSS of 4 (ie, limited walking but without aid) but not the subsequent progression of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>A long-term observational study of patients with progressive types of MS found that polysymptomatic compared with monosymptomatic onset of MS was associated with a significantly shorter time to the development of progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H605008317\" class=\"local\">'Rate of worsening'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008365\"><span class=\"h2\">MRI markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main MRI markers of MS disease activity and pathology are lesion load and atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. The lesion load is assessed on conventional T2-weighted, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted MRI sequences. The degree of brain atrophy affecting gray and white matter, as well as the presence of so-called &quot;black holes&quot; (ie, areas of abnormal hypointensity on T1-weighted MRI) can be quantified using T1-weighted MRI sequences, and may correlate better with clinical disability than lesion volume on T2-weighted MRI. Although not routinely assessed in clinical practice, spinal cord atrophy is also associated with disability in MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>].</p><p>The lesion load on T2-weighted MRI scan has been associated with an increased risk of disability in some studies but not others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. As an example, a serial MRI study in 71 patients followed for a mean of 14 years found that lesion volume at 5 years and the change in volume during the first 5 years of illness correlated more strongly with disability scores at 14 years than measures of volume at earlier or later times, suggesting that the development of lesions in the early years may have an important influence on long-term disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>However, there is only weak correlation between MRI lesion load and age at disease onset, disease duration, and progression, as shown in an analysis of 1312 placebo subjects with MS in pooled data from 11 randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The correlation appears to plateau at higher levels of disability, suggesting that MRI lesion burden is a poor measure of disease progression in patients with advanced disease.</p><p>Furthermore, the extent of cranial MRI abnormalities in individual patients does not necessarily correlate with the degree of clinical disability. Patients with small numbers of lesions may be quite disabled, while others can function well despite a large burden of disease detected by MRI. There are several possible explanations for this observation: some lesions may occur in areas that are clinically silent, while others may involve clinically eloquent areas and cause specific disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]; small lesions in the spinal cord can cause major disability in the absence of cerebral lesions; MRI may miss or underestimate lesions that are clinically relevant such as those in cortex, basal ganglia, and brainstem; and large plaques detected by MRI may not have functional correlates but reflect increased tissue water without impairment of neural function.</p><p>The amount of ongoing MRI activity (new or enlarging lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gadolinium-enhancing lesions) exceeds the observed clinical activity by a factor of 5 to 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This may reflect not only the issues discussed above, but also may be due in part to underreporting of minor symptoms and under-recognition of minor signs in patients with MS. It does, however, suggest that MS is a much more dynamic and active disease than is clinically apparent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605008371\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple sclerosis is a disease that predominantly affects women and has a maximum incidence during child-bearing years. Pregnancy appears to have a protective effect against MS relapses, but there is an increased risk of disease exacerbation in the early postpartum period. When the protective effect during pregnancy and the increased risk in the early postpartum period are combined, the net effect is no increase in the risk of exacerbation. The available evidence suggests that maternal MS is associated with a modestly increased rate of caesarean delivery and lower infant birth weights. However, birth outcomes have not been systematically studied. The choice of anesthesia for delivery in mothers with MS should be based upon obstetric concerns. These issues are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic disorders complicating pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Multiple sclerosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605011218\"><span class=\"h2\">Demographics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Racial differences may also exist for the clinical features and prognosis of MS, although this is less well established than for differences in the risk of developing MS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis#H548438808\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and epidemiology of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Geographic factors'</a>). A retrospective study found that black Americans who develop MS have a later age of disease onset than white Americans (age 33.7 versus 31.1 years, respectively) and are more likely to develop ambulatory disability than white Americans with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Since the median time to both MS diagnosis and MS onset to treatment was significantly shorter for blacks compared with whites in this study population, it is likely that the increased risk of disability for blacks is independent of health care access.</p><p>The same study noted that black Americans with MS were more likely to present with multifocal signs and symptoms, were more likely to have clinical involvement restricted to the optic nerves and spinal cord (opticospinal MS), and were more likely to develop transverse myelitis compared with white Americans with MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. It should be noted that while 63 black Americans in the study had opticospinal MS (defined as relapses or clinical signs restricted to the optic nerves and spinal cord), only three met the criteria for neuromyelitis optica (NMO or Devic syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-course-and-classification-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

The pattern and course of MS is further categorized into several phenotypes or clinical subtypes as follows (see <a href=\"#H605008275\" class=\"local\">'Disease pattern'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is the first attack of a disease compatible with MS that exhibits characteristics of inflammatory demyelination but has yet to fulfill MS diagnostic criteria. If untreated, many if not most patients with CIS will eventually be diagnosed with MS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is characterized by clearly defined relapses with full recovery or with sequelae and residual deficit upon recovery. There is no or minimal disease progression during the periods between disease relapses. This type of MS accounts for approximately 85 to 90 percent of MS cases at onset. However, most patients with RRMS will eventually enter a secondary progressive phase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is characterized by an initial RRMS disease course followed by progression with or without occasional relapses, minor remissions, and plateaus. Some studies suggest that SPMS ultimately develops in most patients with RRMS and is the stage in which patients accumulate the greatest amount of neurologic disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is characterized by disease progression from onset with occasional plateaus and temporary minor improvements allowed; acute attacks may also occur. This type represents about 10 percent of adult cases at disease onset, but is rare in children with MS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worsening of disability due to MS is highly variable. The impact of MS varies according to a number of measures, including severity of signs and symptoms, frequency of relapses, rate of worsening, and residual disability. Accumulating evidence suggests that, in most patients, worsening is slow. At the extreme ends of the severity spectrum, there are benign and malignant forms of MS, but the determination of these is always retrospective and must be made cautiously. (See <a href=\"#H605008305\" class=\"local\">'Disease severity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a variety of possible prognostic indicators in MS. However, none are established as reliable, and our ability to accurately predict outcomes for individual patients with MS is quite limited. The development of a progressive course of MS may be the single most adverse factor influencing prognosis.
