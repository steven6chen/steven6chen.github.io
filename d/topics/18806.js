Adding to this body of literature, a retrospective database study of over one million surgical patients without a history of opioid misuse or ongoing opioid use identified opioid misuse (ie, opioid dependence, abuse, or overdose) in 0.6 percent of patients after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-anesthesiology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The total duration of opioid prescription was the strongest predictor of misuse. Each prescription refill was associated with a 44 percent increase in the rate of misuse, and each additional week of opioid use increased the risk of misuse by 20 percent. While the risk of opioid misuse after surgery is low, the absolute number of patients affected is large because of the volume of surgery performed.

Excess prescription has been well documented in adults, but there have been no data on opioid requirements or prescribing practices for pediatric patients. A prospective study of 343 children who were discharged from the hospital with an opioid prescription reported that 58 percent of prescribed doses were not consumed, and only 4 percent of leftover medication was disposed of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-anesthesiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Female sex, orthopedic or Nuss procedures, and discharge pain scores <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;5/10</span> predicted higher opioid consumption.

In the intervention group, SBP was maintained within 10 percent of the patient&rsquo;s resting baseline value, with norepinephrine infusion as needed, while the control group received standard care (treatment to maintain the SBP &ge;80 mmHg or to prevent a 40 percent or greater decrease from baseline SBP). The primary composite outcome (systemic inflammatory response syndrome with renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, or neurologic dysfunction) occurred less frequently in the intervention group. This study supports individualizing intraoperative management to maintain the blood pressure close to the patient&rsquo;s baseline in patients at high risk of postoperative complications due to chronic hypertension, age, or other factors.

In the TRICS III trial, over 5000 adults at high risk of death were randomly assigned to a restrictive red cell transfusion threshold (transfuse if hemoglobin &lt;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> or a liberal threshold (transfuse if hemoglobin &lt;9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-anesthesiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of the composite outcome of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, stroke, or new-onset renal failure with dialysis while, as expected, the rate of transfusion was higher in the group with the higher transfusion threshold. This trial confirms findings in smaller randomized trials and supports our practice to transfuse to maintain the hemoglobin level above 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> recognizing that individual patient factors may alter this threshold.

A randomized trial in nearly 200 patients undergoing lung resection surgery demonstrated a lower incidence of mortality in the first year when a sevoflurane-based anesthetic technique was used compared with a propofol-based TIVA technique (2.3 versus 12.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-anesthesiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Fewer postoperative pulmonary complications (14 versus 28 percent) and reduced expression of lung and systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines were noted in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> group. We suggest sevoflurane as the primary agent to maintain anesthesia during open pulmonary resection with one lung ventilation, with administration of supplemental intravenous agents such as opioids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a>, and a neuromuscular blocking agent.

In a prospective observational study of patients who received intrathecal morphine 150 mcg at cesarean delivery, a mild oxygen desaturation event (median peripheral arterial oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] &lt;90 percent in a 30-second monitoring window) was detected in 23 percent, and a severe desaturation event (median SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;85 percent) in 4 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-anesthesiology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Desaturations most frequently occurred four to eight hours after administration of intrathecal morphine. Patients with risk factors for respiratory depression may require pulse oximetry monitoring for 24 hours after neuraxial morphine.

A large retrospective study compared the risk of a mental health diagnosis or developmental delay for children in 11 separate age cohorts (from &lt;28 weeks to 5 years) undergoing minor common surgical procedures with matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-anesthesiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although there was an increased risk for a mental health disorder or developmental delay in children with anesthesia exposure (hazard ratios 1.26 to 1.31), there was no difference in risk between the different age cohorts. There is little support for delaying necessary minor surgery in young children to reduce neurodevelopmental risks.

The difference remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders, although residual confounding may still contribute to this finding. ELM may improve the glottic view during laryngoscopy in selected patients (eg, children with anteriorly placed airways due to congenital anomalies or trauma patients with cervical spinal motion restriction in place), but routine use for endotracheal intubation in children does not appear to be beneficial.

Among these, most do not have clinical findings of myocardial infarction. In a prospective study of about 2000 patients at increased cardiovascular risk (over 2500 surgeries), hs-cTnT was measured before and after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-anesthesiology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. An increase in hs-cTnT occurred in 16 percent of surgeries and correlated with an increase in both 30-day and one-year mortality, irrespective of clinical findings of myocardial infarction. We suggest perioperative hs-cTn testing in patients at high cardiovascular risk to screen for myocardial injury and need for electrocardiogram monitoring, imaging studies, or therapies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or statins.

In a systematic review that included mostly observational data, withholding these agents on the morning of noncardiac surgery in 1816 patients was associated with less intraoperative hypotension compared with administering them in 4206 patients (23 versus 30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-anesthesiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, rates of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) did not differ. Decisions to withhold or administer ACE inhibitors or ARBs on the morning of surgery should be based on individual patient- and procedure-related factors.

A study of three million cases and over 1800 types of operations in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQUIP) database identified a continuum of cardiac risk within these categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-anesthesiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As an example, within the high-risk category identified by standard risk screening tools, there was a threefold difference in risk between laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy and Whipple procedure. These data have been used to create a more granular risk screening model that might better inform decisions about evaluation and alternative treatment. The model requires external validation and may require institution-specific modification for application.
