It is a benign disorder, self-limited, and associated with a complete recovery in most patients. Nonetheless, its symptoms of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and gait impairment can be disabling in the short term.</p><p>Vestibular neuritis also shares clinical features with less benign disorders, particularly acute vascular lesions of the central nervous system, from which it must be accurately differentiated in order to avoid morbidity and mortality.</p><p>This topic will review the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of vestibular neuritis. The evaluation and differential diagnosis of vertigo are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with vertigo&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-etiology-and-differential-diagnosis-of-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, etiology, and differential diagnosis of vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vestibular neuritis is generally understood to be a viral or postviral inflammatory disorder affecting the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve. This pathophysiological mechanism is not necessarily accurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are little pathologic data to support this mechanism in patients with this disorder, and a history of a preceding viral illness is elicited in less than one-half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vestibular neuritis, also known as vestibular neuronitis and labyrinthitis, represents an acute, spontaneous, peripheral vestibular ailment, characterized by the rapid onset of severe vertigo with nausea, vomiting, and gait instability.</p><p>Physical examination findings are consistent with an acute vestibular imbalance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous vestibular nystagmus that is unilateral, horizontal, or horizontal-torsional, that is suppressed with visual fixation, and that does not change direction with gaze. The fast phase of nystagmus beats away from the affected side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive head thrust test. With rapid turning of the head toward the side of the lesion by the examiner, the patient is unable to maintain visual fixation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52022\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52022 \">figure 1</a>). In one series, this was present in 82 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients in this series with a positive head thrust sign were also more likely to have persistent symptoms. While a positive head thrust test supports the diagnosis of vestibular neuritis, it does not definitively rule out a central nervous system disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with vertigo&quot;, section on 'Other vestibular signs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gait instability with preserved ability to ambulate. If the patient sways or falls, it is opposite to the direction of the fast component of the nystagmus, ie, toward the affected side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other neurologic signs and symptoms (dysarthria, dysphagia, weakness, sensory loss, facial droop, limb dysmetria) are absent. Vertical diplopia or skew eye deviation may be present due to an imbalance in otolithic-ocular reflexes, although its presence suggests that the patient has had a stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with vertigo&quot;, section on 'Other vestibular signs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In pure vestibular neuritis, auditory function is preserved; when this syndrome is combined with unilateral hearing loss, it is called labyrinthitis.</p><p/><p>In one study of 101 patients, three clinical signs, in particular, were useful in distinguishing vestibular neuritis from a cerebrovascular event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The presence of either a normal head thrust test, a skew deviation, or direction changing nystagmus had a 100 percent sensitivity and a 96 percent specificity for stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many conditions cause vertigo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66539\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66539 \">table 1</a>). The clinical features of common causes of vertigo are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81596 \">table 2</a>). The differential diagnosis of vertigo is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-etiology-and-differential-diagnosis-of-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, etiology, and differential diagnosis of vertigo&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-vertigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with vertigo&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The principal differential diagnostic concern in a patient presenting with acute sustained vertigo is a vascular event in the central nervous system affecting the cerebellum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This possibility should be considered in all patients with vascular risk factors, because of the relatively high risk of recurrent vascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebellar hemorrhage or infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important consideration in the differential diagnosis of a patient with acute sustained vertigo is a vascular event (infarction or hemorrhage) in the cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. As many as 25 percent of patients older than 50 years presenting to the emergency department with this clinical picture have a cerebellar infarction rather than vestibular neuritis, although the percentage is usually reported as much lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. As this alternative diagnosis represents a potentially immediately life-threatening condition, it is important to consider this possibility in every patient who presents with acute sustained vertigo. Patients with acute cerebellar lesions may have distinctive clinical features from that of vestibular neuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/11,12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nystagmus is not suppressed with visual fixation.

The direction of falling is not necessarily opposite to the direction of the nystagmus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may also be limb dysmetria, dysarthria, or headache.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head thrust test is usually normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms may be unremitting for 72 hours or more.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a vascular event are typically older <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have atherosclerosis risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, smoking).</p><p/><p>Despite these caveats, the distinction between vestibular neuritis and acute cerebellar lesions is not always apparent; patients with acute vertigo are often quite ill, and the examination may be limited. When the diagnosis is unclear, a neuroimaging study may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/2,12,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Brainstem infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common stroke syndrome producing vertigo is a lateral medullary infarction producing a constellation of symptoms and signs known as a Wallenberg syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissociated sensory loss (loss of pain and temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face and contralateral limbs and trunk)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal eye movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ipsilateral loss of corneal reflex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hoarseness and dysphagia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ipsilateral limb ataxia</p><p/><p>While these signs are usually apparent after a careful neurologic examination, these signs may be overlooked by patients and nonneurologists because the vertigo, nausea, and vomiting may overwhelm the clinical pictures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-circulation-cerebrovascular-syndromes#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes&quot;, section on 'Lateral medullary infarction'</a>.)</p><p>More restrictive brainstem infarctions have been described that affect isolated vestibular structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, their clinical manifestations are very similar to vestibular neuritis. While accurate diagnosis is still desirable, there is somewhat less clinical imperative to diagnose these lesions, especially urgently. These are usually due to small arterial disease related to age, hypertension, and diabetes. The long-term management for this condition is atherosclerosis risk factor management and antiplatelet therapy, which are both indicated even in the absence of a known cerebrovascular event.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of vestibular neuritis is largely based on clinical information. There are no specific diagnostic tests.</p><p>Neuroimaging is indicated to rule out alternative diagnoses if the examination is not entirely consistent with a peripheral lesion, if there are prominent risk factors for stroke, if there are neurologic signs or symptoms, or if there is a new headache accompanying the vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A younger patient with acute sustained vertigo, with no other neurologic signs or symptoms, and with nystagmus and an examination that is consistent with a peripheral origin (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above) does not need imaging if there is improvement within 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The procedure of choice is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA). MRI can detect infarction in the posterior fossa on the first day. MRA has a specificity and sensitivity exceeding 95 percent in detecting stenosis or occlusion of the posterior circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) scanning with thin cuts through the cerebellum is an alternative when MRI scanning is not available or in patients with metallic implants. The scan is usually normal in the first hours after an infarct; however, intraparenchymal hemorrhage or significant edema compressing the fourth ventricle will usually be evident immediately. A brain CT scan should therefore be performed if an MRI scan is not immediately available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with vestibular neuritis generally suffer from severe vestibular symptoms for one to two days, followed by a gradual diminution of symptoms and a return of equilibrium. While the acute illness rarely lasts more than several days to a few weeks, residual imbalance and nonspecific dizziness may persist for months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Early improvement in symptoms is believed to be largely due to central compensation. Tests of vestibular function, such as caloric testing, show improvement and ultimately recovery as well, but with a significant lag time compared with clinical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].A positive head thrust sign is of uncertain significance. &#160;Two studies have found that abnormal head thrust testing correlates with ongoing symptoms and predicts a more protracted course, especially if it remains positive in follow-up examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], whereas another study found no correlation between abnormal head thrust testing and persistent dizziness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Usually patients suffer from vestibular neuritis only once. In one case series of 103 patients followed for almost 10 years, just two patients had a recurrence, both in the contralateral ear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, in one series, 15 percent later developed benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Panic disorder has been found to develop in 10 percent of patients with vestibular neuritis over two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential treatments for vestibular neuritis include acute disease-specific treatment with corticosteroids and antiviral agents, symptomatic treatments, and vestibular rehabilitation. There are few formal studies of these therapies in patients with vestibular neuritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute disease-specific treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with corticosteroids during the acute period of vertigo has been shown to improve the recovery of peripheral vestibular function in patients with acute labyrinthitis. A controlled trial randomly assigned 141 patients with vestibular neuritis to one of four treatment groups: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a>, methylprednisolone plus valacyclovir, or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The main outcome measure of vestibular function was the extent of unilateral caloric paresis; this was determined by measuring the mean peak slow-phase nystagmus velocity after caloric irrigation. The following observations were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (22-day tapering dose schedule) significantly improved vestibular function at 12-month follow-up compared with placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> 1000 mg three times daily for seven days did not improve outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> was no more effective than methylprednisolone alone.</p><p/><p>Although outcome as measured by caloric response was improved in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> treatment groups, the study did not assess outcome by the duration and severity of symptoms such as imbalance and chronic spatial disorientation. Therefore, it is not clear that corticosteroid treatment provides long-term symptomatic relief, and further controlled trials are needed to address this issue.</p><p>Another smaller, randomized, controlled study of 30 patients with vestibular neuritis found somewhat different results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for five days then a 15 day taper) was associated with improved outcomes on some measures at three and six months, but all objective and subjective outcomes were similar at 12 months. This suggests that corticosteroid therapy may hasten recovery, but does not change the long term prognosis.</p><p>A meta-analysis examined the efficacy of corticosteroids in four randomized controlled studies (149 patients), including the two previously discussed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There was an overall significant effect of corticosteroid therapy on complete caloric recovery at one month but not at 12 months. They found that the small sample size and methodological issues with the included studies precluded firm conclusions regarding the benefit of corticosteroids, particularly on long-term outcomes.</p><p>Despite these somewhat conflicting results and remaining questions, it seems reasonable to treat presumed viral acute labyrinthitis with corticosteroid therapy. We typically prescribe a 10-day course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>; 60 mg daily on days one through five, 40 mg on day six, 30 mg on day seven, 20 mg on day eight, 10 mg on day nine, and 5 mg on day 10.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic treatments to reduce vertigo, nausea, and vomiting are often employed in the first few days of vestibular neuritis. These include antiemetics, antihistamines, anticholinergics, and benzodiazepines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68052 \">table 3</a>). A nonoral route is generally preferred. Lower doses should be attempted, with upward titration as needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vertigo#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vertigo&quot;, section on 'Symptomatic treatment'</a>.)</p><p>There is little evidence supporting the use of one agent over another. In general, we prefer using antihistamines and anticholinergics over the benzodiazepines, because they are somewhat less sedating. One trial compared intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimenhydrinate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dimenhydrinate</a> (50 mg) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> (2 mg) in 74 patients with acute peripheral vestibulopathy. After two hours, patients treated with dimenhydrinate had better ability to ambulate and were more likely to feel ready to go home compared with patients treated with lorazepam (86 versus 69 percent), who also felt drowsier after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Another study compared intramuscular dimenhydrinate (50 mg) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=droperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">droperidol</a> (2.5 mg) in 40 patients with acute peripheral vertigo and found similar efficacy of the two agents; after 30 minutes, approximately 40 percent of patients felt sufficiently improved to go home without further treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>While they provide necessary symptomatic relief in the first 24 to 48 hours, these medications are believed to be somewhat contraindicated after that time. By suppressing vestibular activity, they are believed to impair the central compensation response and delay long-term recovery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Vestibular rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vestibular exercises are believed to be helpful in hastening recovery and improving disability in patients with permanent vestibular injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vertigo#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vertigo&quot;, section on 'Vestibular rehabilitation'</a>.)</p><p>Most studies of vestibular rehabilitation have not been specific to etiology. However, one study randomly assigned 39 patients with vestibular neuritis to physical therapy versus standard care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Evaluation at 30 days revealed that balance function was substantially improved in treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vestibular-neuritis-and-labyrinthitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Other measures of central compensation appeared similar between the groups.</p><p>Vestibular rehabilitation is most likely to be efficacious when the patient is referred for a vestibular physical therapy evaluation and completes an individually-designed program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
