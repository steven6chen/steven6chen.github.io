This is supplemented in selected cases by blood and urine tests, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, electroencephalography, and other procedures. In this context, neuroimaging provides unique and valuable information that complements the other elements of a dementia evaluation.</p><p>Neuroimaging can be divided into structural, functional, and molecular categories. Structural brain imaging studies are generally considered routine parts of dementia evaluations and may be repeated at a later time point for clarification of diagnosis. More specialized functional and molecular imaging studies are performed in selected patients when additional diagnostic information is required.</p><p>Diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders acknowledge the existence of precursor states to symptomatic dementia, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and preclinical stages, which lack overt clinical symptoms but can be identified on the basis of biomarkers and imaging evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In this context, neuroimaging has taken on new importance as an objective means of documenting some of the earliest manifestations of dementia pathology.</p><p>Structural, functional, and molecular imaging techniques in dementia will be reviewed here. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and dementia are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional topics relevant to the diagnosis of specific forms of dementia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alzheimer disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular dementia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vascular-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of vascular dementia&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dementia with Lewy bodies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frontotemporal dementia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111521677\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURAL NEUROIMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Structural imaging visualizes physical alterations in the properties of brain tissue that occur in aging and various disease states. With variable sensitivity depending upon the pathology, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can detect cerebrovascular disease, demyelinating disorders, and space-occupying lesions. Other pathologic processes that are detectable by structural imaging and are potentially salient to a dementia evaluation include trauma, infections, inflammation, spongiform changes, edema, hematomas, and hydrocephalus. In addition, structural imaging can be used to identify global and regional brain atrophy patterns that occur as a consequence of neuronal damage and loss in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111521684\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT and MRI are the structural imaging techniques most commonly used in the evaluation of dementia.</p><p>CT uses radiographs to measure the density of brain tissue and produces images with sub-millimeter, in-plane spatial resolution in only a few minutes of scan time. CT provides limited contrast between gray and white matter, but more clearly delineates acute blood, calcifications, and fluid collections, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).</p><p>MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to create images of the distribution of protons (hydrogen nuclei) in tissue. MRI signals are derived predominantly from water molecules in the brain and, to a much lesser extent, lipids and proteins. The spatial resolution of MRI is comparable with CT, but tissue contrast can be superior, even without the injection of exogenous contrast agents. MRI studies typically take 30 to 60 minutes to perform because multiple pulse sequences are used to highlight or enhance different aspects of brain anatomy and pathology.</p><p>MRI carried out for the purposes of a dementia evaluation usually includes volumetric T1 images, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, diffusion, and susceptibility-weighted images (SWIs). In certain circumstances, additional sequences are employed to address specific diagnostic questions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F94376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94376 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345217038\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for structural imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is relatively good agreement among professional groups that structural neuroimaging should be performed to detect treatable causes of dementia and to differentiate among various dementia subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, there are differences in opinion about whether structural neuroimaging studies should be performed routinely in every patient with suspected dementia or more selectively.</p><p>The American Academy of Neurology recommends that all patients with newly discovered cognitive impairment undergo at least one CT or MRI as part of the clinical evaluation of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other groups, especially in the primary care areas, have favored more selective use of neuroimaging and advocated the use of decision algorithms to choose the patients most likely to have treatable brain abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Examples of high-risk factors include younger age (&lt;60 years), presence of focal neurologic signs, and short duration of symptoms (eg, &lt;2 years). The sensitivity and specificity of clinical prediction rules are generally low, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Retrospective analyses have suggested that less than 1 percent of cases with potentially treatable conditions would go undetected if structural neuroimaging was not performed as part of an initial dementia evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In most cases, the comorbidities that are found on structural imaging are not the primary cause of the dementia, and treatment of the comorbidity does not lead to complete reversal of the cognitive impairments.</p><p>Repeat imaging is sometimes necessary to assess disease progression and to document treatment response. In general, the interval and frequency of repeat imaging depends on the nature of the underlying conditions. In disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD), repeated scans are not required if progression follows the expected course and no secondary comorbidities are suspected.</p><p>Examples of indications for repeat imaging include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, papilledema)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New focal neurologic findings (eg, suggestive of stroke)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New-onset seizure disorder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent head trauma, particularly in patients who are anticoagulated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have a change from their neurologic examination at baseline</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden, unexpected mental status alterations without a readily identified cause</p><p/><p>In addition, structural imaging is typically carried out before performing lumbar puncture or other invasive procedures that could otherwise result in brain herniation if a structural lesion causing increased intracranial pressure goes undetected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345225286\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography versus magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When both types of scanners are available and patient compliance is not an issue, MRI is much preferred over CT for the evaluation of dementia because it permits a broader range of brain tissue properties to be probed while avoiding exposure to potentially harmful ionizing radiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A CT scan is the best option when the patient is too claustrophobic for an MRI, has a pacemaker or ferromagnetic implants, or is unable to remain still enough to undergo the more time-consuming MRI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'Precautions'</a>.)</p><p>CT scans are generally less costly than MRI and may be preferable in the <span class=\"nowrap\">acute/emergency</span> care situation when extra-axial or intraparenchymal hemorrhage must be ruled out but agitation mandates very short scanning times. Patients who are anxious or restless can be sedated for structural imaging studies, if need be, since there is little potential for sedatives to interfere with these imaging results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345225328\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of contrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous contrast agents highlight regions of vascular compromise <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disruption of the blood brain barrier. Contrast will accordingly highlight acute stroke, expanding neoplasms, certain brain infections, and localized inflammation. For the routine evaluation of patients with suspected neurodegenerative dementias, noncontrast structural brain imaging is often sufficient.</p><p>Since intravenous contrast agents pose risks of allergic reactions and impaired renal function, they are generally reserved for use in patients with unexplained focal central neurologic findings or in whom there is a suspicion of neoplasm or CNS infection. Intravenous contrast agents are also used for angiography to examine vascular patency and CT perfusion studies to evaluate regional cerebral blood flow. Angiography is performed to evaluate suspected aneurysms, vascular occlusions, or vascular malformations, which are more often incidental findings than primary causes of dementia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111521703\"><span class=\"h2\">Structural imaging findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Structural imaging findings can assist in the primary diagnosis of dementia or suggest the presence of comorbidities that may exacerbate dementia symptoms. Some of the more common findings of structural brain imaging that have particular relevance to dementia are discussed below.</p><p>Structural imaging findings in specific types of dementia are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;, section on 'Supportive ancillary tests'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease#H406199175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frontotemporal-dementia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frontotemporal dementia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345217138\"><span class=\"h3\">Cerebral atrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral atrophy, or the visible loss of brain volume, is common in patients with dementia. Atrophy may be generalized or regionally localized.</p><p>Cortical atrophy is manifested by widening of sulci, narrowing of gyri, decreased grey matter thickness, diminished white matter volume, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enlargement of the cerebral ventricles and subarachnoid spaces. Normal brain aging is associated with some of the same changes, although typically age-related atrophy is less rapid, and usually less severe, than that of neurodegenerative disease. It is estimated that the brain loses approximately 0.5 percent of its volume each year in normal aging, compared with 1 to 2 percent in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 2 to 4 percent in dementia due to AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As a consequence, atrophy on structural brain images must be interpreted relative to the patient&rsquo;s age and other factors.</p><p>Certain regions of the brain show selective vulnerability to different neurodegenerative disorders. This results in distinctive clinical presentations and characteristic atrophy patterns visible on brain imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F94377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94377 \">table 2</a>). Asymmetric cortical atrophy is often observed in neurodegenerative dementias and sometimes manifests as disproportionate impairments in the functions mediated by the more atrophic regions. A number of other rare disorders with circumscribed cortical atrophy syndromes have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345216987\"><span class=\"h3\">Hippocampal atrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hippocampal atrophy is one of the earliest and most salient manifestations of AD. It can be appreciated by visual inspection of volumetric T1 images sliced in coronal planes perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. Automated determination of hippocampal volume on MRI is becoming increasingly available and may be helpful in determining the likelihood of pathologic atrophic change.</p><p>Hippocampal atrophy also occurs in conditions such as mesial temporal sclerosis, temporal lobe epilepsy, and certain vascular insults, and, as such, should not be considered pathognomonic of AD. Hippocampal atrophy is nevertheless supportive of an AD diagnosis, and its complete absence in a patient with dementia should at least raise suspicion of an alternative diagnosis to AD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease#H406199175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345216994\"><span class=\"h3\">Cerebrovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebrovascular disease can cause cognitive deficits ranging from mild impairment to frank dementia. The increasing prevalence of white matter ischemic changes with advancing age has been implicated as one of the factors responsible for age-related cognitive decline.</p><p>Most forms of vascular cognitive impairment manifest visible alterations on structural brain imaging studies. Neuroimaging findings are a required element of some of the commonly used diagnostic criteria for vascular dementia, including the NINDS-AIREN criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67333 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Common MRI findings associated with vascular dementia include cortical and subcortical infarctions and periventricular white matter lesions. Serial neuroimaging studies can sometimes be used to document the temporal relationship between cerebrovascular changes and the onset or progression of cognitive impairment, thereby confirming a vascular dementia diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vascular-dementia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of vascular dementia&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.)</p><p>Although CT can readily identify frank infarction and subcortical ischemic changes, MRI is more sensitive to chronic cerebrovascular changes. The greater sensitivity of MRI can be problematic, however, as it can result in over-attribution of cerebrovascular disease as the cause of dementia. Since the incidence of ischemic changes is increased with aging and in diseases such as AD, the presence of ischemic changes on MRI or CT does not necessarily indicate a vascular etiology for the patient&rsquo;s dementia. The Hachinski ischemic score has been used to distinguish between vascular dementia and AD with reasonably good validity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81210\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81210 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vascular-dementia#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of vascular dementia&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345217000\"><span class=\"h3\">Microhemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral microhemorrhages are a common finding on MRI in older individuals, particularly if sensitive MRI techniques are employed. Microhemorrhages can be observed in association with vascular anomalies, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), or hypertensive microangiopathy.</p><p>Microhemorrhages are best detected by gradient echo MRI pulse sequences and with higher sensitivity SWI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97714\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97714 \">figure 1</a>). In population-based studies, cerebral microhemorrhages are detected in approximately 15 to 25 percent of older individuals and become more common with advancing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Microhemorrhages associated with CAA are primarily in the cerebral cortex, whereas microhemorrhages associated with small vessel disease typically occur in the basal ganglia, thalamus, or pons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. CAA can occur in subjects without dementia, but also has an increased prevalence in patients with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The co-occurrence of CAA and AD has been associated with more severe cognitive impairment, compared with AD alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral amyloid angiopathy&quot;, section on 'Cognitive impairment'</a>.)</p><p>Detection of microhemorrhages can impact decisions concerning anticoagulation since CAA may lead to spontaneous hemorrhage and increases the risk of intracranial bleeding in patients treated with anticoagulants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-amyloid-angiopathy#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral amyloid angiopathy&quot;, section on 'Avoiding anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345217019\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventriculomegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with dementia, ventricular enlargement may occur in association with progressive cortical atrophy without evidence of obstruction; this is often referred to as hydrocephalus ex vacuo. Alternatively, ventricular enlargement may occur in association with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is a potentially treatable cause of dementia that typically presents as the symptomatic triad of dementia, incontinence, and gait disturbance. NPH may be due to a variety of causes, including disturbances of cerebrospinal fluid production and circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-pressure-hydrocephalus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal pressure hydrocephalus&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Structural brain imaging with CT or preferably MRI can readily document ventricular enlargement, but it is somewhat more challenging to determine whether the enlargement is explained by or disproportionate to the degree of cerebral atrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76428\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76428 \">image 1</a>). Several imaging findings can be useful for distinguishing NPH from ventricular enlargement due to brain atrophy, such as the presence of elevation of the high parietal convexity, an acute callosal angle on coronal sections, enlarged sulci towards the dorsal surface of the brain, and preservation of the parahippocampal fissures despite reduced hippocampal volume. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-pressure-hydrocephalus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal pressure hydrocephalus&quot;, section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345217013\"><span class=\"h3\">Altered brain diffusivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is particularly helpful in the diagnosis of dementia due to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the most common of the human prion diseases. Although prion-related spongiform disorders of the brain are rare, they are rapidly progressive and fatal conditions that can afflict any age group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology and classification'</a>.)</p><p>In sporadically occurring CJD, DWI studies are more sensitive than T2-weighted or FLAIR sequences for detection of a characteristic bright signal within the cortical ribbon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subcortical structures such as the putamen and caudate head. The bright signal on DWI represents areas in which spongiform changes have altered the local diffusivity of water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although not diagnostic, the presence of such increased signal is a useful adjunct diagnostic sign of CJD. The imaging features and diagnosis of CJD are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=creutzfeldt-jakob-disease#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111521732\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONAL AND MOLECULAR NEUROIMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional neuroimaging measures parameters that are either coupled to or correlated with the brain&rsquo;s neuronal activity. Functional imaging studies include measures of brain perfusion (blood flow), cerebral metabolic activity, and brain network connectivity. Molecular imaging measures the quantity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distribution of specific biochemical entities in the brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111521740\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional imaging modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are the most common functional imaging techniques utilized in patients with suspected or established dementia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345220440\"><span class=\"h3\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both PET and SPECT are nuclear medicine techniques that use ionizing radiation in the form of short-lived radioisotopes that are injected intravenously. SPECT uses radiation detectors and tomography to reconstruct an image of the distribution of radioisotope in the brain. PET uses coincidence detection to localize the anatomic origin of positrons that are emitted simultaneously in opposite directions from the decay of certain radioisotopes. For both PET and SPECT, the results are displayed as either gray-scale or color-coded intensity maps. PET can achieve higher spatial resolution than SPECT, but is generally more costly to perform.</p><p>PET scanners frequently have integrated CT capabilities that allow for simultaneous acquisition of structural brain images and combined MR-PET scanners are beginning to be utilized. Such instrumentation permits more exact coregistration of anatomic and functional data, as well as correction of certain PET technical artifacts. As an example, dementia-associated brain atrophy can complicate the interpretation of functional and molecular imaging studies due to partial volume effects that average together signal from brain parenchyma and neighboring CSF and lower the observed signal intensity. This can lead to the appearance of hypometabolism in areas of metabolically normal brain or reduce the apparent amyloid burden in atrophied gray matter regions on PET performed with an amyloid-binding tracer. Atrophy correction algorithms can be applied to compensate for partial volume effects, but are not used universally in clinical practice.</p><p>Most functional imaging protocols used in the evaluation of dementia are &quot;resting state&quot; procedures in which the patient lays quietly in the scanner in an awake but inactive state. Activation studies, which require repetitive performance of tasks in the scanner, can be impractical for dementia patients due to impairments in the ability to follow directions. Resting state functional imaging studies can reveal alterations in brain activity characteristic of different forms of dementia, but medication effects, dietary intake, psychiatric conditions, and other comorbidities can confound interpretation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345220446\"><span class=\"h3\">Parameters</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345220376\"><span class=\"h4\">Cerebral perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebral perfusion is a functional imaging parameter that is sometimes used in the evaluation of suspected dementia. Various imaging modalities can be used for this purpose, including HMPAO SPECT, [O-15] H<sub>2</sub>O (&quot;O15 water&quot;) PET, CT contrast studies, and arterial spin label (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). HMPAO SPECT and CT perfusion are the most frequently used techniques for clinical purposes due to availability and relatively low cost. ASL MRI is beginning to see more widespread use, however.</p><p>The term, cerebral perfusion, refers to blood flow at the level of the arteriolar or capillary beds. Under normal circumstances, brain perfusion is tightly coupled to neuronal activity (autoregulation). Perfusion is often reduced in the brain of patients with dementia, either due to decreased blood supply (as in the case of vascular dementia) or decreased demand secondary to neuronal dysfunction or cell death. The latter is most common in neurodegenerative dementias such as Alzheimer disease (AD). The pattern of reduction can be useful in distinguishing among different causes of dementia. (See <a href=\"#H111521758\" class=\"local\">'Functional imaging findings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345220382\"><span class=\"h4\">Regional glucose metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another functional imaging measurement available in dementia evaluations is [F18] fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET, which measures regional cerebral glucose metabolism.</p><p>Glucose is the major source of energy for the brain, and FDG is an analogue of glucose that is transported into the brain, but is only substrate for the first step in the glycolytic pathway. FDG-6-phosphate accumulates in neurons proportional to the amount of glycolysis being carried out over the 30- to 40-minute period after its injection because the molecule cannot be further metabolized without the missing oxygen atom. By labeling FDG with the positron emitter F18, images can be generated in which the intensity is proportional to brain activity.</p><p>In many forms of dementia, cerebral metabolism is regionally or globally reduced due to decreased supply of blood and oxygen or because of decreased demand in the context of neuronal loss and dysfunction. The pattern of hypometabolism can help distinguish among various types of dementia. (See <a href=\"#H111521758\" class=\"local\">'Functional imaging findings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111521746\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular imaging modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SPECT and PET are the most widely used technologies for molecular imaging, supplemented occasionally by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Examples of molecular neuroimaging modalities include 123I-FP-CIT single photon emission tomography (DaT) scans used for confirmation of Parkinson disease and amyloid PET imaging in AD.

To protect the thyroid from radioactive iodine exposure, pretreatment with potassium iodide is recommended before ioflupane administration.</p><p>DaT scans can reliably distinguish patients with Parkinson disease and other parkinsonian syndromes from controls or patients with essential tremor, and their accuracy in the diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes is similar to the accuracy of a carefully obtained clinical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

These molecules are coupled to the positron-emitting F18 to permit their detection and localization in the brain. After injection, a waiting period of 30 to 50 minutes is required to allow background activity from nonspecific binding to wash out of the brain. If there is fibrillar beta amyloid in the brain, the compounds, such as florbetapir or flutemetamol, remain bound to amyloid plaques and are revealed as increased F18 retention and PET signal. A few tracers have been approved by the US and European authorities, but are not yet reimbursed by the majority of commercial or government payers.</p><p>Other radioligands are now under development for detecting other pathologic processes associated with dementia, such as neuro-inflammation and tau protein deposition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345220420\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance spectroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another imaging modality that is occasionally used in dementia evaluations is MRS, which uses magnetic resonance techniques to measure the amount <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distribution of various chemicals in the brain, each of which is reflective of some metabolic activity in the region of interest. MRS has lower resolution than structural MRI, but permits monitoring aspects of intermediary metabolism that are unobtainable by other in vivo methods.</p><p>MRS has circumscribed applications in the evaluation of dementia, such as the evaluation of suspected mitochondrial encephalopathies and when additional information about brain lesions, such as suspected tumors, is desired.

In many geographic regions, access to PET is limited by the availability of scanners and the cyclotrons needed to generate radioisotopes with short half lives. While SPECT scans may be more widely available and can provide a less expensive alternative to PET for certain studies, the functional measures available with SPECT as well as its spatial resolution are more limited. These and other considerations often lead to selective use of functional and molecular neuroimaging in patients with suspected dementia.</p><p>Dementia-related indications for cerebral metabolic studies with FDG PET or perfusion techniques such as HMPAO SPECT include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumstances in which the differential diagnosis is between AD and frontotemporal dementia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease#H406199175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of suspected AD in the context of mild cognitive impairment (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment#H3031873\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mild cognitive impairment: Prognosis and treatment&quot;, section on 'FDG-PET and functional MRI'</a>)</p><p/><p>The appropriate use of amyloid PET imaging is an evolving topic. Although amyloid PET tracers have been approved by regulators in the United States and elsewhere, amyloid PET is not a routine test in dementia assessment at present.</p><p>A task force of the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Association and Society for Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging has published appropriate use criteria that recommend amyloid imaging studies be considered in the following circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cognitive dysfunction that may be due to AD, but in whom there are persisting uncertainties about the diagnosis despite otherwise thorough evaluations.

A negative amyloid PET scan in a normal subject does not mean that individual cannot develop AD in the future. However, a negative scan in a person with dementia reflects high likelihood that AD is not the cause.</p><p>Although techniques such as FDG PET and amyloid imaging are sensitive to brain changes in AD patients several years prior to the onset of actual dementia symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], these tests are not currently recommended for routine use in the prediction of dementia outside of the context of research studies. Several caveats apply to the interpretation of such scans in patients without symptoms of dementia. As an example, there can be overlap between the earliest signs of Alzheimer pathology discoverable by neuroimaging and benign brain changes associated with aging. There are also conditions other than AD that cause dementia and may not be detected by amyloid PET during prodromal phases.</p><p>Finally, not all individuals with positive amyloid scans will develop cognitive symptoms in their lifetimes, as significant amyloid burden and other AD pathology have been found in autopsies of cognitively normal older adults. While the presence of amyloid (by PET scan or diminished amyloid by cerebrospinal fluid testing) in cognitively normal older adults is associated with higher risk of cognitive decline over three years compared with the absence of amyloid, the clinical significance of these findings and their long-term implications are not well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Amyloid imaging largely mirrors these autopsy findings: in a meta-analysis of 55 studies of amyloid PET in adults without dementia (n=8694), the prevalence of a positive amyloid PET scan increased with age, ranging from 10 percent in 50 year-olds with normal cognition to 44 percent in 90-year-olds with normal cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. By contrast, among individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AD, the prevalence of a positive amyloid PET scan decreases slightly with advancing age, particularly among those who are <em>APOE</em> epsilon 4 noncarriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroimaging-studies-in-the-evaluation-of-dementia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. For these and other reasons, neuroimaging studies are considered adjunct diagnostic tests for dementia rather than predictive measures at the present time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111521758\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional imaging findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In clinical practice, most functional and molecular images are interpreted by visual inspection, although the parameters being measured are inherently quantifiable.
