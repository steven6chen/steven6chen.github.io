Its use, however, is limited since even ideal candidates who undergo allogeneic HCT have a high rate of treatment-related mortality, and because its efficacy compared with autologous HCT is not fully established. The treatment-related mortality associated with allogeneic HCT is decreasing with the advent of nonmyeloablative preparative regimens. At the same time, new chemotherapeutic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>) are being incorporated into the initial treatment of multiple myeloma, and survival with chemotherapy alone or with autologous HCT is improving. As such, the role of allogeneic HCT in the treatment of multiple myeloma is not clear.</p><p>The use of allogeneic HCT in the management of patients with multiple myeloma will be reviewed here. The process of determining the appropriate initial therapy for patients with multiple myeloma, eligibility guidelines for HCT, and response criteria used to evaluate the treatment of multiple myeloma are discussed separately, as is a comparison of allogeneic HCT to autologous HCT and chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial chemotherapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating response to treatment of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of progenitor (stem) cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MYELOABLATIVE HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myeloablative allogeneic HCT requires hematopoietic cells from an HLA-matched donor, which are given after the patient receives high dose chemotherapy and total body radiation. Allogeneic HCT has two advantages over autologous HCT: the graft does not contain tumor cells; and the transplant can produce a graft-versus-myeloma effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Less than 5 to 10 percent of patients with multiple myeloma are candidates for this approach due to its high toxicity. A detailed discussion on eligibility guidelines is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Autologous versus allogeneic HCT'</a>.)</p><p>In earlier studies, allogeneic HCT for myeloma was associated with an early mortality of at least 20 percent and an overall mortality of 30 to 50 percent, due to fungal infections, interstitial pneumonitis, and graft-versus-host disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>].

Although there is a suggestion that the mortality rates are lower in more recent years, data are lacking.

However, myeloma usually relapses after allogeneic HCT, even in complete responders. In a series of 80 patients in Seattle who underwent allogeneic HCT, only five were alive without evidence of disease four to seven years after HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the majority of these patients had chemotherapy-resistant disease, which may have contributed to the relatively poor long-term outcome.</p><p>At this time, standard myeloablative transplants are not routinely performed in myeloma outside of a clinical trial setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Myeloablative allogeneic transplantation is considered (typically as an option at first relapse) in selected patients (age less than 60 to 65 years) with high risk myeloma who have a matched donor and are willing to accept a high early treatment-related mortality. Myeloablative allogeneic transplantation is also considered in selected patients with relapsed refractory myeloma with a good performance status in whom other treatment options appear limited. Options for conditioning regimens for a myeloablative allogeneic transplantation in myeloma include <span class=\"nowrap\">Mel/TBI</span> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> plus total body radiation 12 Gy), and BuMel (busulphan, melphalan).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SYNGENEIC HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only a limited number of syngeneic (ie, identical twin donor) transplants have been performed in multiple myeloma.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation performed a case-matched analysis on 25 syngeneic transplants (24 using bone marrow and one using peripheral blood stem cells) and compared the results with 125 patients who underwent autologous transplantation and another 125 who underwent allogeneic transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Only two twins died of transplant-related toxicity. Overall survival for the twins was 73 months, significantly better than that of the case-matched autologous transplants (44 months); both groups outperformed the allogeneic transplants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Seattle Marrow Transplant Team performed syngeneic transplants on five patients with multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Four patients responded to therapy, while one patient died one month after transplant from cytomegalovirus-associated interstitial pneumonitis.

However, in some of the available studies, treatment-related mortality has been appreciable, while in others relapse may be more frequent, due in part to lessening of graft-versus-myeloma effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>].</p><p>As an example, a study of 53 patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma and an HLA-identical sibling received induction therapy followed by a partially T cell-depleted myeloablative allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although the overall response rate was 89 percent, treatment-related mortality was 34 percent and 26 percent of patients died from progressive myeloma. At a median follow-up of 38 months, only 3 of the 20 surviving patients were in long-term complete remission.</p><p>The use of a T cell depleted allogeneic HCT, combined with late donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) to increase the graft-versus-myeloma effect is an approach currently under investigation. In one study, treatment-related toxicity was appreciable; only 14 of the 24 patients were able to receive a T cell depleted HCT plus DLI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

This approach relies more on donor cellular immune effects and less on the cytotoxic effects of the preparative regimen to control the underlying disease. Nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT and reduced intensity HCT are associated with lower rates of treatment-related toxicity and treatment-related mortality, but higher rates of relapse compared with rates previously seen with myeloablative allogeneic transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-22</a>].

As with myeloablative allografts, the best outcomes are seen in patients transplanted early in the course of their disease when the disease is in remission. As such, several groups are pursuing protocols in which an autologous HCT is followed by a nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>The prospective trials that have investigated nonmyeloablative HCT have conflicting data regarding survival rates, but are consistent in their treatment-related mortality rates (11 to 18 percent at five years) and rates of extensive graft-versus-host disease (50 to 74 percent). New strategies are needed to improve the safety and efficacy of nonmyeloablative HCT. Until such improvements are demonstrated, this strategy is not recommended for most patients with newly diagnosed myeloma outside of a clinical trial setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/10,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Autologous followed by nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT in newly diagnosed myeloma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strategy of autologous HCT followed by nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT is not recommended for patients with newly diagnosed myeloma outside of a clinical trial setting, except perhaps in those with high-risk prognostic factors (ie, del(13), hypodiploidy, t(14;16), del(17p), or a plasma cell labeling index of &ge;3 percent). Even in such patients the role of allogeneic HCT approaches is investigational, especially given the superior results that are being obtained with newer induction regimens. </p><p>Randomized trials of allogeneic HCT have not been feasible for patients with myeloma. Instead, investigators have relied on a &quot;biologic randomization&quot; in which patients are assigned to treatment with or without allogeneic HCT based upon the presence or absence of an HLA-matched sibling donor. Patients without an HLA-matched sibling are assigned to treatment with maintenance therapy or observation, depending upon the trial design. Results are then evaluated by an intention-to-treat analysis for &quot;donor&quot; and &quot;no donor&quot; (available) treatment groups. As with randomized trials, not all patients in the &quot;donor&quot; group ultimately receive an allogeneic HCT, but they would still be included in the &quot;donor&quot; group for the statistical analysis.</p><p>The results of donor versus no donor trials have been mixed. While they all demonstrate lower relapse rates and higher rates of nonrelapse mortality among allogeneic HCT recipients, the majority suggests that this does not translate into a survival benefit. Of importance, options for the treatment of relapsed myeloma have increased dramatically since many of these trials were conducted. The most recent trials, some of which allowed for the use of novel agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>) at relapse, have not demonstrated a survival benefit with allogeneic HCT.</p><p>A 2013 meta-analysis included data from 1822 patients with previously untreated myeloma enrolled on six prospective trials comparing double autologous HCT versus a single autologous HCT followed by nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. When compared with double autologous HCT, allogeneic HCT was associated with greater treatment-related mortality (relative risk [RR] 3.3; 95% CI 2.2-4.8) and a greater likelihood of attaining a complete response (RR 1.4; 95% CI 1.1-1.8), but similar overall survival both during the first 36 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1.15; 95% CI 0.91-1.45) and beyond 36 months (HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.53-1.04).</p><p>The following is a brief summary of the largest trials conducted in this setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest study was conducted by the Bone Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Of the 625 patients with standard risk myeloma in this trial, 189 with an HLA-identical sibling donor were assigned to receive a myeloablative autologous HCT followed by a nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT (completed in 83 percent). The 436 patients without a sibling donor were assigned to double autologous HCT (completed in 84 percent) followed by a second randomization to maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a></span> or observation. At a median follow-up of 40 months, double autologous HCT resulted in similar rates of progression-free (46 versus 43 percent) and overall (80 versus 77 percent) survival at three years when compared with autologous HCT followed by nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT. In the nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT arm, grade II&ndash;IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 26 percent of patients by day 100. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 47 percent at one year and 54 percent at two years. As with standard risk myeloma, a subgroup analysis of the 85 patients enrolled in this trial with high risk myeloma found no benefit to autologous HCT followed by nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT.

The preferred method is the measurement of monoclonal (M) protein in serum and urine. Free light chain (FLC) measurements are primarily reserved for patients with unmeasurable M-protein in the serum and urine. Among patients without an M protein in serum or urine and normal FLC ratio, further evaluation includes bone marrow immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence and plasma cell labeling index. Blood counts, renal function, and serum calcium are also monitored. After day 100, tests for monitoring response to therapy and to detect relapse are performed every three months.</p><p>The International Myeloma Working Group has developed uniform response criteria, which are used to measure the effect of treatment for multiple myeloma. These criteria are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating response to treatment of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Allo-HCT and minimal residual disease negative state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcome after HCT may be better assessed by evaluating the patient for achievement of a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative state (complete remission by molecular methods) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. This issue was addressed in a series of 48 patients in complete clinical remission following allo-HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Durable polymerase chain reaction negativity for clone-specific markers, mixed negativity and positivity, or positivity were noted in 33, 40, and 27 percent, respectively. The cumulative risks for disease relapse at five years were zero, 33, and 100 percent, respectively. However, testing for MRD negativity at present is experimental and is not available in most centers.</p><p>In a study of 229 patients with MM, clinical complete remission (CCR) was attained in 38 and 22 percent following allogeneic or autologous HCT, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. For those attaining CCR following allo- or auto-HCT, 50 and 16 percent, respectively, were considered to be MRD negative, as defined by repeated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity. Median relapse-free survivals for those who did or did not attain MRD negativity were 110 and 35 months, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Corresponding relapse rates were 16 and 41 percent, respectively.</p><p>These results support the concept, as shown in other hematologic malignancies, that a deeper response is associated with longer relapse-free survival and reduced relapse rates. However, as noted above, the achievement of a complete response by molecular methods (MRD negativity) does not equate with cure. In one study of 14 patients with MM in complete remission by the EBMT criteria following high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> and autologous HCT, all were PCR negative on follow-up bone marrow examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, 8 of the 14 have since relapsed, all with the original immunoglobulin rearrangement present at disease presentation. The main limitations are that MRD testing is not widely available and not fully standardized.</p><p>Similar results can perhaps be obtained by monitoring for the presence of neoplastic plasma cells in bone marrow aspirates post-HCT, using flow cytometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].
