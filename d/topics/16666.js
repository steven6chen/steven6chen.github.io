Uterine aspiration is commonly performed up to 14 weeks of gestation, though some clinicians offer uterine aspiration in the second trimester. Medication abortion is safe and effective up to 10 weeks of gestation. Most abortions in the United States are performed in the first trimester; in 2013, 91.6 percent were performed at &le;13 weeks, with 67.9 percent being performed as uterine aspiration. First-trimester uterine aspiration is generally performed in the outpatient setting and is less costly than procedures done in the operating room [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the United States, 80 to 90 percent of uterine aspiration procedures are performed in ambulatory settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>First-trimester uterine aspiration abortion is reviewed here.

Women should be counseled about the full range of pregnancy options: parenting, abortion, and adoption. Counseling should be a patient-centered shared decision-making process to ensure that a patient's decision is informed, voluntary, and free of coercion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients should be made aware of risks and benefits of the procedure and alternatives, and this should be documented in the medical record and on the consent form.

Medication and aspiration abortion are both safe and effective for appropriately selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The choice is based upon availability, gestational age (medication abortion is less successful in the late first trimester), and patient preference. Women seeking abortion care should be counseled about the advantages and disadvantages of both options.</p><p>Given the available data comparing the two procedures, we suggest first-trimester medication abortion for eligible women who place a high value on avoiding surgery or anesthesia and who are willing to accept more discomfort and awareness of the procedure. For other women, particularly those who place a high value on completing the procedure in one visit, we recommend aspiration abortion. Comparison of first-trimester aspiration and medication abortion is discussed in detail separately.

There are no absolute indications for hospital-based terminations. Most patients with stable, chronic medical conditions may obtain abortions safely as outpatients. Patients who are in need of an abortion and who are unstable or those already hospitalized for acute illnesses or other medical conditions (such as decompensated heart failure or severe symptomatic anemia) may be best managed as an inpatient. Procedures in women with obstetric issues such as suspected placental implantation abnormalities including placenta accreta in the late first trimester, which may require urgent surgical intervention, may be best performed in a hospital setting. The clinician should evaluate each patient and determine the best setting for an aspiration abortion depending upon the patient's history and status, provider experience level, resources at their clinic, and available resources for referral. Otherwise, admission to a hospital prior to uterine aspiration is generally not needed. Hospital admission after uterine aspiration is rare and the criteria for this depend upon severity of complications.</p><p>Some geographic areas have limited access to abortion care, and hospital-based care may not be readily available. In these cases, outpatient or ambulatory care centers with deep sedation or higher-level staffing (eg, anesthesiologist, certified nurse anesthetist) are appropriate alternatives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909421247\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPROCEDURE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1507016619\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to first-trimester aspiration abortion, clinicians should elicit a targeted medical history focusing on obstetric, gynecologic, relevant medical, surgical, and psychosocial history, as well as medications and allergies.

Uterine aspiration may be performed in the setting of uterine infection, as long as the patient is evaluated and found to be stable, any discomfort is tolerable to the patient, and appropriate management and follow-up is possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4008464416\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory evaluation typically includes confirmation of pregnancy by urine pregnancy test or ultrasound, <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit,</span> and Rhesus (D) (Rh[D]) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> status.</p><p>Routine testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia infection prior to uterine aspiration is not required.

Some outpatient clinics may have the ability to directly dispense medications, while other providers may prescribe benzodiazepines or opiates in advance for the patient to bring with them for administration in clinic prior to the procedure. Any patient taking sedating medications, whether oral or IV, should be instructed that she cannot drive herself home after the procedure and must have a confirmed person to take her home after the procedure.

Further surgical intervention may be indicated if hemorrhage is persistent or there is evidence of visceral injury.</p><p>Expectant management of uterine perforation typically includes monitoring of vital signs and symptoms (uterine tenderness, vaginal bleeding) for one to two hours and postprocedure ultrasound to evaluate for free fluid in the pelvis. Anaerobic coverage with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> 500 mg by mouth twice daily for one week is common, but no studies have addressed this practice. Further details on uterine perforation are discussed separately.

Hematometra usually presents with complaints of dull, aching lower abdominal pain, sometimes accompanied by tachycardia, diaphoresis, or nausea. The onset is usually within the first hour after completion of the procedure.</p><p>Pelvic examination reveals a large midline globular uterus that is tense and tender, or an enlarged uterine cavity filled with echogenic material on ultrasound. Treatment requires immediate uterine evacuation, permitting the uterus to contract to a normal postprocedure size. Administration of intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylergonovine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylergonovine</a> maleate (0.2 mg) may be given to ensure continued contraction of the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H729117228\"><span class=\"h2\">Retained products of conception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retained POC (ie, placental tissue, fetal fragments, fetal membranes) is an uncommon complication of abortion by uterine aspiration. In one series with follow-up information on 80 percent of patients who underwent pregnancy termination, retained POC were present in 4 of 672 first-trimester procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>It may be difficult to distinguish retained POC from hematometra or infectious endometritis based on clinical evaluation alone. These postabortion entities may all present with similar symptoms and exam findings: lower abdominal or pelvic pain and an enlarged or tender uterus. Hematometra is more likely when the presentation of pain is immediately postabortion (within one hour) and without heavy vaginal bleeding. Retained POC is more likely when the presentation is delayed and accompanied by heavy or persistent vaginal bleeding days or weeks after the procedure. An infectious etiology is more likely to be accompanied by fever, or when pain is not associated with sonographic evidence of retained tissue in the uterine cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Any physical or sonographic evidence of retained POC should prompt consideration of suction curettage to complete evacuation of the uterus, especially in the acutely symptomatic patient. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> is an alternative treatment for retained POC in doses used for incomplete abortions or miscarriages: 600 mcg orally or 400 mcg sublingually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. One study published a misoprostol success rate of 93 percent to treat retained POC in 88 patients and a corresponding decrease in the use of repeat dilation and curettage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3961124990\"><span class=\"h2\">Ongoing pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ongoing pregnancy is more likely to be a complication of early rather than late abortion. All women will continue to have an elevated level of hCG for a short period following pregnancy termination. Return of the serum hCG concentration to undetectable following pregnancy termination varies widely from 7 to 60 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The period of time depends primarily upon the hCG concentration at the time of termination. The hCG concentration peaks at 8 to 11 weeks of gestation at approximately 90,000 milli-international units per mL. This is in contrast with term pregnancy, for which the hCG concentration is lower. The decline in serum hCG is rapid for the first several days (half-life 9 to 31 hours) and then proceeds more slowly (half-life 55 to 64 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/45,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,62,63</a>].

Alternatively, ongoing pregnancy may rarely result from a multiple gestation in which only one of the sacs was aborted. In one series of 12,138 consecutive abortions with careful examination of the pathologic specimen, three continuing pregnancies were later diagnosed and attributed to clinician error [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Two were at six weeks and one was at eight weeks of gestation. A second series reported an ongoing pregnancy rate of 1.3 per 1000 procedures for pregnancies less than six weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The type and risk of possible damage to the ongoing pregnancy from an attempted abortion cannot be quantified. Direct or indirect injury to the developing embryo could occur. One preliminary report suggested there may be an increased risk of Moebius sequence with autism in children exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Moebius sequence is a clinical condition characterized by ophthalmic-facial palsy and muscle or bone malformations in the limbs. It represents a cascade of events resulting from embryo trauma from varied etiologies (eg, genetic factors, environmental injuries, prolonged membrane ruptures and chorionic villus sampling). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-as-a-single-agent-for-medical-termination-of-pregnancy#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Misoprostol as a single agent for medical termination of pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Teratogenicity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4250210314\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1565994571\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple gestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine aspiration of multiple gestations in the first trimester can be approached in a similar fashion as a single gestation of the same duration. For example, a six-week twin pregnancy can be successfully evacuated by manual uterine aspiration through a 6 mm cannula following the same steps as for a six-week singleton.</p><p>Many providers will use ultrasound guidance for multiple gestations at an earlier gestational age than for singletons for reassurance of procedure completion, especially as it may be difficult to assess from products of conception (POC) examination if the entirety of all gestational sacs were evacuated.</p><p>Additional considerations to accommodate the increased volume of POC in multiple gestations as compared to singletons include the use of electric vacuum aspirator (EVA) over manual uterine aspirator at earlier gestational ages, and advance preparedness with uterotonics in case of excessive bleeding due to uterine atony.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1494915057\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine anomalies and abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine anomalies or abnormalities, such as large fibroids or a congenital anomaly, can pose challenges in uterine aspiration.

When large fibroids impede placement of the cannula at the fundus to reach the pregnancy, alternate instruments, such as EVA nozzle extenders may be helpful. Some providers anecdotally report modifying flexible cannulas in tandem, or inserting a moldable metal uterine sound inside a cannula to navigate placement past fibroids.</p><p>Finally, it is important to remember that when uterine aspiration is not successful due to these anatomic challenges, medication abortion is often a good alternative for gestations &lt;10 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3293855831\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1482582147\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice between medication abortion and aspiration abortion in the first trimester is based upon availability, gestational age (medication abortion is less successful in the late first trimester), and patient preference. Given the available data, we suggest medication abortion for women who place a high value on avoiding surgery or anesthesia and who are willing to accept more discomfort and awareness of the procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For other women, particularly those who place a high value on completing the procedure in one visit, we recommend aspiration abortion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-medication-abortion-termination-of-pregnancy#H1716018\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester medication abortion (termination of pregnancy)&quot;, section on 'Medication versus surgical termination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preprocedure evaluation includes history, focused general physical examination, and assessment of gestational duration. Pelvic ultrasound may be done if uterine size on examination is inconsistent with expected gestational age or if there is a suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy. Laboratory evaluation typically includes confirmation of pregnancy by high-sensitivity urine pregnancy test or ultrasound, <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/hematocrit,</span> and Rhesus (D) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> status. (See <a href=\"#H909421247\" class=\"local\">'Preprocedure evaluation and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain control for first-trimester aspiration abortion with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, verbal support, and local anesthesia. Oral or intravenous sedation may offer enhanced pain control. (See <a href=\"#H3483723767\" class=\"local\">'Pain management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical preparation with osmotic dilators or cervical ripening medications is typically not required in first-trimester aspiration abortion. Exceptions to this are patient in whom difficult mechanical dilation is anticipated or if there is an increased risk of cervical injury, including &ge;12 weeks, mechanical obstruction of the cervix (eg, prior surgery), nulliparas, or adolescents. (See <a href=\"#H3068603897\" class=\"local\">'Cervical preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aspiration procedure includes positioning and preparation, administration of antibiotics and pain medications, mechanical cervical dilation, and aspiration of uterine contents with a manual or electric aspirator. After aspiration, the products of conception are examined to confirm full uterine evacuation. (See <a href=\"#H2655632363\" class=\"local\">'Aspiration procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H317380233\" class=\"local\">'Tissue evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent postabortion endometritis for patients undergoing first-trimester uterine aspiration abortion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3436301000\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedures are typically performed in an outpatient setting. Future pregnancy plans may be discussed if patients desire, and appropriate guidance given for preconception or contraceptive care. Patients should be counseled to seek medical attention if they have postprocedure symptoms, including excessive vaginal bleeding, persistent pelvic cramps, or temperature &ge;100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C.
