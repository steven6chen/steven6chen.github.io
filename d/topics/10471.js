Such episodes may have been present for extended periods or simply missed on prior examinations. Rarely, a patient with a cerebrovascular accident or arterial thromboembolism is found to have newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation. Symptomatic patients may present with various complaints including palpitation, <span class=\"nowrap\">dyspnea/dyspnea</span> on exertion, reduced exercise <span class=\"nowrap\">capacity/stamina,</span> lightheadedness, and occasionally with chest discomfort or syncope. </p><p>New onset AF occurs not infrequently in hospitalized patients. Predisposing factors include cardiac and noncardiac surgery, infection, recent myocardial infarction, thyrotoxicosis, pulmonary embolism, and myocarditis or pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Once present, AF at presentation can be paroxysmal and stop spontaneously within seven days, persistent (greater than seven days of continuous AF), or long-standing persistent and be present for more than 12 months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation#H541379272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'General classification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H448750704\"><span class=\"h1\">URGENT MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those patients in whom the diagnosis of new onset atrial fibrillation is made in an office setting and who require urgent management due to severe symptoms, hemodynamic instability, evidence of pre-excitation (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), or evidence of myocardial <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemia/infarction,</span> timely transfer to a facility with those capabilities should be carried out. Some patients&rsquo; clinical condition may improve quickly with urgent rate control while others need to have sinus rhythm restored immediately. Clinical judgment is needed to determine whether rate control should be tried or whether to proceed directly to cardioversion. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Rate control'</a> below.)</p><p>Three circumstances for which urgent or emergent cardioversion may be needed include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active ischemia (symptomatic [eg, angina] or electrocardiographic evidence).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of organ hypoperfusion (eg, cold clammy skin, confusion, acute kidney injury). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe manifestations of heart failure (eg, pulmonary edema). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>It should be kept in mind that indiscriminate cardioversion, as opposed to urgent rate control, may have dire consequences or be futile if the cause for the initiation of the problem is not at least in part corrected (eg, immediate cardioversion in a patient with pulmonary edema will be dangerous to the patient and may not be effective without diuresis, oxygen, blood pressure control and other measures). Careful review of comorbidities and absolute need for immediate cardioversion must be weighed against its benefits, as the atrial fibrillation may not be the cause but the consequence of the initiating process. Of equal importance is recognition that cardioversion in patients who have been in AF for 48 hours or longer, or of unknown duration, is associated with an increased risk of stroke and should not be performed in the absence of performing transesophageal echocardiography to screen for thrombus or at least three weeks of anticoagulation, unless the patient is critically ill and no alternatives to cardioversion are available. Cardioversion of AF is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm#H8701654\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'DC cardioversion'</a>.)</p><p>In a patient with any of these indications for urgent cardioversion, and no alternative treatment options <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> failure to respond to rate control, the need for restoration of normal sinus rhythm takes precedence over the need for protection from thromboembolic risk. Intravenous anticoagulation with heparin or administration of a newer oral anticoagulant (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>) should be started, but it should not cause a delay in emergent cardioversion. (See <a href=\"#H88477195\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88477333\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For <strong>stable</strong> patients presenting for the first evaluation of new onset atrial fibrillation (AF), we try to accomplish the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a complete history and physical examination, including an attempt to obtain old records that might contain information about prior supraventricular arrhythmias. The history is particularly helpful in the decision to pursue a rate or a rhythm control strategy (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Risk factors for AF, as well as disease associations, may be identified. Old records should be searched for evidence of a prior episode of AF or other atrial tachyarrhythmias.

Old records should be searched for evidence of a prior episode of AF or other atrial tachyarrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Order laboratory tests including electrolytes, cardiac markers of <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemia/infarction,</span> and thyroid stimulating hormone, in an attempt to identify an underlying cause.

Therapy directed at treating the precipitating cause should be initiated prior to cardioversion in otherwise stable patients and may result in reversion to sinus rhythm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Chronic disease associations'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the electrocardiogram (ECG), the following should be performed on patients with new onset AF:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). It should be obtained even if there are no symptoms suggestive of hyperthyroidism (and if thyroid function has not been measured recently), since the risk of AF is increased up to threefold in patients with <strong>subclinical</strong> hyperthyroidism. The latter disorder is characterized by low serum TSH (&lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> with the newer sensitive assays). Additional thyroid tests may be indicated if the result of the TSH is abnormal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclinical-hyperthyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclinical hyperthyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum electrolytes and assessment of renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients for whom an acute coronary syndrome is being considered, serum markers of <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemia/infarction;</span> we prefer troponin. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B-type natriuretic peptide or Pro-B natriuretic peptide to assess for heart failure, as indicated by the patient presentation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A transthoracic echocardiogram to screen for cardiac causes of new onset AF, even in the face of a normal physical examination. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiograph.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other blood tests dependent on underlying comorbidities and based on medical therapies prescribed.</p><p/><p>AF is rarely the only manifestation of an acute coronary syndrome. We suggest evaluation of myocardial infarction with serial troponin be considered in patients with ECG changes, hypotension, symptoms, history, or additional risk factors. For patients in whom the likelihood of an acute coronary syndrome is low, we do not routinely perform serial troponin testing in the presence of a normal electrocardiogram. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RATE CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) and who are in AF at the time of presentation, rate control will precede any attempt to restore sinus rhythm; the principal exception is patients who are hemodynamically unstable (see <a href=\"#H448750704\" class=\"local\">'Urgent management'</a> above). In patients with mild to moderate symptoms, slowing the rate often results in significant improvement or even resolution of symptoms. </p><p>We believe that attempting to get the rate below 85 beats per minute at rest is reasonable in <strong>symptomatic </strong>patients. For patients who continue with unacceptable symptoms at this goal, an attempt should be made to see if a lower rate goal lessens symptoms. For <strong>asymptomatic </strong>patients with permanent AF, and no known cardiomyopathy, an initial more lenient rate control goal of &lt;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> may be reasonable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter'</a>.)</p><p>Rate control can usually be achieved with oral (or intravenous) beta blockers or calcium channel blockers (primarily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>). Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> has been used for rate control in the past, it is now widely recognized that digoxin is a less effective drug agent for rate control and is generally only used in patients with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. Occasionally, intravenous or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> may be needed to control rate for patients with reduced left ventricular function but should be used with caution given the potential for pharmacologic conversion and risk of thromboembolism. An appropriate anticoagulation treatment strategy should be in place <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> transesophageal echocardiography evaluation prior to initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone. </p><p>The drug selected and the route of administration (oral versus intravenous) are dictated by the clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> are the preferred to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> in the absence of heart failure (HF).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> may help control rate when the other drugs are ineffective or cannot be given. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> is the preferred drug <strong>only</strong> in patients with AF and HF with a reduced ejection fraction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-management-of-atrial-fibrillation-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H365855113\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Rate control'</a>.)<br/><br/>Digoxin can also be used in patients who cannot take or who respond inadequately to beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. The effect of digoxin is additive to both of these drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with preexcitation, atrioventricular (AV) nodal blocking agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, beta blockers, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> must be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Preferential AV nodal blockade with these drugs may lead to more rapid accessory pathway conduction, increasing the risk of rapid preexcited AF leading to ventricular fibrillation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-symptomatic-arrhythmias-associated-with-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of symptomatic arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&quot;, section on 'Acute treatment of atrial fibrillation with preexcitation'</a>.) </p><p/><p>The choice among beta blocker, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> should be based on physician and patient preference, although it may be influenced by other medical problems that are present. As an example, beta blockers are particularly useful when the ventricular response increases to inappropriately high rates during exercise, after an acute myocardial infarction, and when exercise-induced angina pectoris is also present. Intravenous beta blockade is more effective than intravenous calcium channel blockade for rate control, but also for conversion to sinus rhythm, especially after cardiac surgery. If there is a question about tolerance of the beta blocker, a drug with a short half-life would be recommended. On the other hand, a calcium channel blocker is preferred in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.</p><p>Beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are also effective if HF or hypotension is due to the rapid ventricular rates and should be given intravenously if rates exceed 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> or are not well tolerated but not in need of urgent arrhythmic cardioversion. If, however, there is doubt about the origin of the HF, the initial dose should be small (since these drugs impair contractility), with upward titration based upon heart rate slowing, blood pressure, and symptomatic improvement. The decision between intravenous or oral therapy depends on the clinical presentation and the need and urgency for controlling the rate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RESTORATION OF SINUS RHYTHM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with recent onset atrial fibrillation (AF), who are hemodynamically stable (with only mild to moderate symptoms) and whose rate has been controlled (as discussed above), a decision needs to be made regarding the restoration of sinus rhythm. We believe that most patients with symptomatic new onset AF and most patients with apparently asymptomatic AF should have at least one attempt at cardioversion (either electrical or chemical) to sinus rhythm. The timing varies depending on the impact of AF on efficacy of ventricular rate control, hemodynamics, and symptoms. </p><p>There are multiple reasons for cardioversion. Some patients will never have a second episode, or will have very infrequent episodes; cardioversion will likely improve symptom status, particularly in young people. It is also recognized that the duration of continuous AF is a strong predictor of the ability to restore and maintain sinus rhythm. A decision to pursue a rate control strategy and not pursue cardioversion at the time a patient first presents may result in lifelong AF. The best chance to restore and maintain sinus rhythm in patients with AF is when it is first diagnosed. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for a patient to report no symptoms prior to cardioversion, and then note an improvement in quality of life after being cardioverted to sinus rhythm. &#160;</p><p>Circumstances in which it is reasonable to not attempt cardioversion in a patient with new onset AF include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are completely asymptomatic, particularly those who are very elderly (&gt;80 years) with multiple comorbidities, where risks of undergoing cardioversion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pharmacologic rhythm control may outweigh the benefits of restoring sinus rhythm. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient who is symptom free where there is strong evidence they have been in continuous AF for more than three to five years. Evidence to suggest this includes a markedly dilated left atrium (&gt;5.5 cm) and a review of prior electrocardiograms (ECGs) showing no evidence of sinus rhythm despite repeated ECGs over many years. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88476625\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of cardioversion (except in patients who are unstable) is determined in large measure by the duration of the episode. There is a low risk of systemic embolization if the duration of the arrhythmia is 24 to 48 hours or less and there are no cardiac abnormalities (particularly mitral valve disease or significant left ventricular enlargement due to a cardiomyopathy) on transthoracic echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most patients with new onset AF of longer than 48 hours duration should have cardioversion postponed until three weeks of effective anticoagulation has been achieved or a transesophageal echocardiogram has been performed and shows no left atrial appendage clots. (See <a href=\"#H88477195\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88476659\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrical versus pharmacologic cardioversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of electrical or pharmacologic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58616 \">table 1</a>) cardioversion depends upon the comfort of the clinician to use one or the other approach. For first episodes, electrical cardioversion is preferred. In some patients, antiarrhythmic drugs are administered prior to cardioversion to increase the chance of successful reversion and to prevent early, intermediate, and late recurrence. For patients with paroxysmal episodes of AF, drug therapy is preferred if they will have sinus rhythm maintained with long-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and as patients with paroxysmal AF will likely convert anyway with or without electrical cardioversion. A detailed discussion of cardioversion is found elsewhere.

This issue was addressed in a study of 289 such patients who were stable, did not have heart disease, and did not have another indication for hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Pharmacologic cardioversion was attempted in 62 percent and was successful in 50 percent; 28 percent underwent electric cardioversion with a success rate of 89 percent.

This was illustrated in a study of 1822 patients admitted to the hospital because of AF: 356 had an arrhythmia duration less than 72 hours, 68 percent of whom spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Two-thirds of those with spontaneous reversion had AF duration of less than 24 hours, which was the only predictor of spontaneous reversion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxysmal-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal antithrombotic therapy after spontaneous cardioversion of a first episode of AF (lasting less than 48 hours) in patients without structural heart disease is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H88477195\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p>We do not recommend the initiation of drugs to maintain long-term rhythm control, unless the patient is felt to be at high risk for recurrence and a rhythm control strategy has been chosen. (See <a href=\"#H521214080\" class=\"local\">'Antiarrhythmic therapy after reversion to sinus rhythm'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88477195\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTICOAGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) will revert to sinus rhythm spontaneously or undergo an attempt at cardioversion. The principle discussion of the approach to anticoagulation in these patients is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-embolization-prior-to-and-after-restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of embolization prior to and after restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following is a brief summary of recommendations made in that topic:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with AF of more than 48 hours (or unknown) duration, we recommend at least three weeks of oral anticoagulation prior to cardioversion, and four weeks or more of anticoagulation following cardioversion. For patients in whom more urgent restoration of sinus rhythm is desirable for a variety of reasons (including hemodynamic compromised symptoms, difficult rate control, or patient convenience), an alternative strategy is to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram prior to cardioversion to rule out left atrial thrombi and proceed to cardioversion if no thrombi are detected (anticoagulate for at least four weeks after cardioversion). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with AF of less than 48 hours duration, our reviewers have differing approaches. Some start <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, low molecular weight heparin, or a newer oral anticoagulant prior to cardioversion in all patients, while some proceed without anticoagulation in patients with AF of very short duration who have a low stroke risk profile. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a first episode of AF, our experts have differing approaches to the decision regarding long-term anticoagulation. Most anticoagulate based on risk, as determined by the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 2</a>). However, some will not anticoagulate after a first episode, particularly if a reversible cause has been identified. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H521214863\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR HOSPITALIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the need to anticoagulate and the need to &ldquo;rule out&rdquo; myocardial infarction (MI) are often cited as indications for hospitalization, most patients with new onset atrial fibrillation (AF) do not need to be hospitalized. The diagnosis of MI can generally be excluded in the emergency department and most patients do not need to be started on intravenous heparin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-myocardial-infarction-unstable-angina-in-the-emergency-department\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction, unstable angina) in the emergency department&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Possible indications for hospitalization in patients with new onset AF are: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom ablation of an accessory pathway is being considered, particularly if the AF was highly symptomatic and associated with hemodynamic collapse and rapid ventricular response rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe bradycardia after cardioversion.

Examples include the treatment of hypertension, infection, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism, persistent myocardial ischemia, or acute pericarditis.

The elderly are more likely to have a high risk of thromboembolism. There may also be difficulty in controlling the ventricular response rate without causing the development of sick sinus syndrome.

For many patients we have them return in one week or as soon as possible if one week is not realistic for a particular patient. This early return is particularly important for patients started on antiarrhythmic drug therapy, as an electrocardiogram should be performed to look for changes in the QRS duration and the length of the corrected QT interval. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88477049\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL TO A CARDIOLOGIST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common medical problem, many primary care physicians have become able to manage patients without a need for consultation with a cardiologist.

We believe a goal of less than 85 beats per minute at rest is reasonable. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Rate control'</a> above.) <br/><br/>Beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred as first-line agents in most patients.

TEE screening for the presence of atrial thrombi is an alternative strategy prior to cardioversion.
