If the spine twists, one side of the back sticks out more than the other (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56860\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56860 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Scoliosis usually starts to happen as the spine is growing, in childhood or during the teenage years. A birth defect, disease, or injury can cause scoliosis. It might also run in families. But in many cases, doctors do not know what causes scoliosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27682346\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of scoliosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scoliosis usually does not cause symptoms. A doctor or nurse might find it when a child gets a routine checkup. Or the school nurse might notice it during a scoliosis check at school.</p><p>You or your child or teenager might also notice:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A shoulder, shoulder blade, hip, or breast that is higher than the other</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A shoulder blade that sticks out farther than the other</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A skin fold on one side of the waist</p><p/><p>When symptoms do occur, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing &ndash; If the spine curves a lot, the lungs might not have room to work correctly. This can cause breathing problems. Scoliosis this severe usually starts when a child is younger than 10. The scoliosis is usually obvious before breathing problems happen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27682361\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on your child's symptoms. See a doctor or nurse right away if your child limps, does not want to walk, or has one leg that feels weak. Make an appointment to see the doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Everyday activities make your child's back hurt.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child has severe back pain, or back pain that gets worse over time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27682376\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for scoliosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there are several tests. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forward bend test &ndash; This test shows if the spine is twisted so one side of the back is higher than the other. The doctor or nurse can also measure how much the spine is twisted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-ray &ndash; An X-ray of the spine can show how much the spine curves from side to side. Other kinds of X-rays can show if the scoliosis is likely to get worse as the child grows. An X-ray can also help the doctor tell if another problem in the body is causing the scoliosis.</p><p/><p>Depending on the situation, the doctor might also order a test called an &quot;MRI.&quot; This imaging test creates pictures of the inside of the body. The pictures show more detail than an X-ray.</p><p>Your child's doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask questions. Along with tests, this should tell the doctor or nurse if your child has scoliosis and what is causing it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27682391\"><span class=\"h1\">How is scoliosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is different for each person. Mild scoliosis does not need to be treated. But severe scoliosis can cause breathing problems and heart problems. People with severe scoliosis need treatment.</p><p>Your child's doctor will talk to you about different treatment options. Options for treatment depend on whether the scoliosis is likely to get worse or not. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No treatment &ndash; If a child is finished growing and the spine does not curve a lot, treatment is usually not needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watchful waiting &ndash; If a child is <strong>not</strong> finished growing but the scoliosis is not severe, the doctor might suggest watching for changes. The child might need to see a specialist if the doctor or nurse cannot tell exactly how much the spine curves or if the scoliosis starts getting worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bracing &ndash; A child might need a brace that helps straighten the spine if:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>He or she still has a lot of growing to do, and</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The scoliosis gets worse in 6 months or less</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; If the spine curves a lot, the doctor might recommend surgery even if a child is done growing. This is because severe scoliosis usually gets worse with time. The surgery joins vertebrae (bones in the spine) together to help them line up correctly. This can keep the curve from getting worse.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27682406\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my daughter wants to have children in the future?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scoliosis does not usually cause problems with pregnancy and giving birth. In the past, some doctors thought pregnancy made scoliosis worse. Today, doctors know this does not happen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27682423\"><span class=\"h1\">Can my child live a normal life?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Most people with scoliosis do not have long lasting problems. A few people have back pain, but it is usually not serious.</p><p>Severe scoliosis that is not treated can damage the heart and lungs. If scoliosis is caused by a serious medical condition, that condition can cause problems, too. Your doctor or nurse will watch for problems and treat them if they happen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27682440\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=back-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Back pain in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
