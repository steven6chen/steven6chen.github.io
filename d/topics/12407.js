The bone marrow has an enormous production capacity; it is estimated that 10<sup>10</sup> erythrocytes and 10<sup>8</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> leukocytes are produced per hour in the steady state. Furthermore, while cell numbers are maintained within fairly narrow limits in normal subjects, they can be greatly amplified on demand.</p><p>These huge cell numbers are immediate descendants of maturing precursors that arise from a smaller pool of progenitors. The progenitors in turn arise from an even smaller pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that are thought to be mostly in a resting or non-dividing state and have the capacity to self-renew (and thus maintain their numbers).</p><p>HSCs are multipotent and have the capacity to differentiate into the cells of all 10 blood lineages: erythrocytes, platelets, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, T and B lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the hematopoiesis and the regulation of HSCs. A general overview of stem cells is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BONE MARROW ANATOMY AND MICROENVIRONMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1531757\"><span class=\"h2\">Sites of hematopoiesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative red (active) marrow space of a child is much greater than that of an adult, presumably because the high requirements for red blood cell production during neonatal life. While vertebrae and pelvic bones remain active sites of hematopoiesis through life, during postnatal life red blood cell demand and therefore production is reduced, and much of the marrow space is slowly and progressively filled with fat, in particular, the marrow in the facial bones as well as the diaphyses of long bones such as the radius, ulna, femur, and fibula. Hematopoiesis becomes restricted to the skull, vertebrae, pelvis, and metaphyseal areas of long bones in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In certain disease states that are usually associated with anemia (eg, primary myelofibrosis, infiltrative diseases of the bone marrow such as granulomas or metastatic cancer, or diseases characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis such as thalassemia major), hematopoiesis may return to its former sites in the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes and may also be found in the adrenal glands, cartilage, adipose tissue, thoracic paravertebral gutters, and even in the kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1531764\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow microenvironment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To develop and differentiate, hematopoietic progenitor cells require both cellular and soluble growth factor support. The cellular elements are provided by the surrounding bone, bone marrow stroma, and the microenvironment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p>The microenvironment of the bone marrow cavity is a vast network of vascular channels (sinusoids that drain into the central vein and arterioles) between which float fronds of hematopoietic cells, including fat cells. Reticular cells form the adventitial surfaces of the vascular sinuses and extend cytoplasmic processes to create a lattice on which blood cells are found. The lattice itself can be demonstrated by reticulin stains of marrow sections, while the conformation of the meshwork of reticulin and the location of hematopoietic cells in the network of vascular sinuses is illustrated by scanning electron microscopy.</p><p>The hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells are supported by a stromal cell network that provides cell-cell contact support. The network provides two major functions: an adhesive framework onto which the developing cells are bound, and the production of essential hematopoietic growth factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Along with T lymphocytes, these cells produce a variety of adhesion molecules and hematopoietic growth factors or cytokines that are thought to support the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of HSCs and progenitors. Primitive mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are thought to have the capacity to differentiate into osteolineage cells, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and perivascular cells (referred to as CAR cells or CXCL12 reticular cells) that have been detected by expression of CXCL12, nestin, and leptin receptor (LEPR).</p><p>The bone marrow circulation comprises central and radial arteries that ramify in the cortical capillaries, join the marrow sinusoids, and drain into the central sinus. Cells egress from the marrow sinusoids into the venous circulation through concomitant veins. The inner, or luminal, surface of the vascular sinusoids is lined with endothelial cells, the cytoplasmic extensions of which overlap, or interdigitate, with one another. The escape of developing hematopoietic cells into the sinus for transport to the general circulation occurs through gaps that develop in this endothelial lining and through endothelial cell cytoplasmic pores. </p><p>HSCs are found in two distinct niches: an endosteal niche where HSCs lie in close proximity to a subset of spindle-shaped, N-cadherin-positive osteoblasts; and a vascular niche lined by sinusoidal endothelial cells and mesenchymal stromal cell derivatives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94175\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94175 \">figure 2</a>). While these separate anatomical regions were postulated to have different roles in supporting stem cell function, other data suggest that the role of the endosteal niche is indirect, through secretion of cytokines and extracellular matrix proteins that affect sinusoidal stromal cell function by cells of an osteoid lineage. Fluorescence staining of CD150-positive, CD48-negative, CD41-negative, lineage-negative HSC in sections of bone marrow show that most HSC localize to sinusoids in close proximity to mesenchymal stromal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Data using alpha-catulin-GFP as a stem cell marker and deep confocal imaging showed that HSC are more common in the central marrow rather than near the endosteal surface, and that these cells are in close proximity to leptin receptor and CXCL12-positive niche cells that are close to sinusoidal blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Together, the niches provide a microenvironment for cell contact and secretory functions of osteolineage cells, osteoclasts, sinusoidal endothelial cells, macrophages, MSCs including CAR cells, sympathetic neurons, and the extracellular matrix. In addition, there are nestin-positive stromal cells, thought to be neural crest-derived, that support hematopoiesis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteolineage cells are required for G-CSF mediated HSC mobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and are important for lymphoid T and B cell development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ablation of CAR cells leads to reduction of SCF and CXCL12, with decreased proliferation of lymphoid and erythroid progenitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endothelial cells express adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, and secrete paracrine growth factors and cytokines: they play a role in the expansion of HSC in culture by Notch ligand production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macrophages (CD169-positive) secrete oncostatin-M, which in turn stimulates nestin-positive cells to express CXCL12; binding of CXCL12 to the CXCR4 receptor on HSCs is important for the retention of HSCs in the bone marrow niche [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sympathetic nerve innervation of the bone marrow is thought to regulate the circadian cycle of HSC release from the bone marrow. Norepinephrine release is transmitted to MSC by beta3-adrenergic receptors, which leads to rapid down regulation of CXCl12 expression and HSC release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>Cells that comprise the HSC niche may also induce irreversible changes in HSC. The first example of this surprising mechanism came from study of retinoblastoma (RB) protein or retinoic acid receptor gamma (RAR&gamma;) deficient mice. Surprisingly, transplantation of wild type HSC into these mice led to the development of myelodysplasia in the donor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. More recently, deletion of the microRNA processing enzyme Dicer in osteoprogenitor cells led to myelodysplasia and AML. The Dicer deletion reduced the expression of the <em>SBDS</em> gene (the gene mutated in the inherited bone marrow failure disease Shwachman Diamond syndrome [SDS]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients with SDS have an increased risk of developing myelodysplasia and AML.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A series of experiments led to the demonstration of the multipotent stem cell. The concept that sustained hematopoiesis comes from multipotent stem cells derives from the observation that mice can be protected from the lethal effects of whole body irradiation by exteriorization and shielding of the spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This protective effect was shown to be cell-mediated as the injection of spleen cells could initiate recovery and reestablish hematopoiesis in irradiated animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Compatible with the hypothesis of the clonal nature of hematopoiesis and the concept that a single multipotent stem cell has the capacity to repopulate the entire hematopoietic system was the demonstration that colonies of murine hematopoietic cells could be observed in the spleen of irradiated, transplanted recipients within 10 days after the transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S) generated colonies that contained precursors to erythrocytes, granulocytes and macrophages, and megakaryocytes.</p><p>Subsequent experiments using karyotypically marked donor cells confirmed the clonal origin of the differentiated cells in the colony, proving that a single multipotent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) had given rise to these differentiated cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It was also shown that each colony that formed at day 12 after transplantation (CFU-S12) contained a number of cells that could again form a colony of differentiated progeny in a second irradiated recipient, demonstrating their self-renewal capacity; in contrast, spleen colonies that form on day eight (CFU-S8) have only myeloerythroid potential.</p><p>The demonstration of a multipotent stem cell in adult bone marrow led to a systematic search for the ontogenic origins of HSC. In mammals, hematopoiesis occurs sequentially in the yolk sac, an intraembryonic <span class=\"nowrap\">aorta/gonad/mesonephros</span> (AGM) region, placenta, fetal liver, and finally the bone marrow. Whether HSC first arise in the yolk sac or AGM region has been controversial. Classic studies by Metcalf and Moore [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] showed that hematopoiesis does not occur in fetal liver if the yolk sac is removed on day 7.5, and HSC-like cells can be detected as early as day 9 in murine yolk sac [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. An explanation for this result is provided by the discovery that yolk sac hematopoiesis occurs in two waves, primitive erythropoiesis (e7.25) that comprise macrocytic nucleated cells, followed shortly thereafter (e8.5) by definitive erythroid-myeloid progenitors that transitions to fetal liver after the circulation is established. The progeny of the erythroid progenitors support fetal erythropoiesis during the rapid erythroid expansion during gestation, the myeloid progenitors give rise to long-lived (adult) resident macrophage derivatives in brain (microglia), skin, and liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The important observation that cells with long-term repopulating (LTR)-HSC activity arise first in the AGM region and not in yolk sac or other intraembryonic regions supports the evidence that HSC capable of reconstituting hematopoiesis form first within the embryo proper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Stem cells in other tissues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stem cell model of hematopoiesis has parallels in other organ systems. That rapidly self-renewing epithelial tissues like skin and intestine have stem cells that continually replenish the cells lost by differentiation is well described. However, the demonstration of the existence of neural stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>] has raised the possibility that many organ systems might retain a population of self-renewing stem cells. Muscle satellite cells also appear to fulfill this role. These organ or tissue specific stem cells arise during early fetal development from embryonic stem cells of the inner cell mass of the blastocyst that are totipotent and give rise to all body cell types. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Mesenchymal stem cells'</a> below.)</p><p>A general discussion of other types of stem cells, including induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of stem and progenitor cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stem cells are identified by a number of assays. The factors that regulate production are not completely understood but include a variety of humoral or marrow stroma derived regulators.</p><p>Maturing precursors and mature cells are recognizable under a microscope. In contrast, progenitors and HSC are morphologically indistinguishable, and functional assays or identification of surface antigenic characteristics are required to detect their presence. Progenitor cells will form colonies of maturing cells of different lineages if they are immobilized in a semisolid medium (eg, semisolid medium containing methyl-cellulose or agar) and stimulated with growth factors. They are often collectively referred to as colony forming cells (CFC) or units (CFU). Examples of growth factors include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57050\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57050 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stem cell factor (SCF, also called Steel factor or KIT ligand) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], interleukin-3 (IL-3), and erythropoietin (EPO) drive the proliferation and maturation of primitive erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E); the more mature erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) are entirely EPO dependent for their first few divisions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) drive the development of granulocyte and macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">In vitro assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many in vitro assays that measure functions characteristic of HSC have been proposed as surrogate HSC assays but, until homogeneous populations can be evaluated in both in vitro and in vivo transplantation assays, it will be impossible to determine the precise cell type measured by these methods. Multipotency is demonstrated by colonies in semisolid media that contain granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes and megakaryocytes (CFU-GEMM) in methyl-cellulose cultures of human bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. A unique type of in vitro blast cell colony that comprises small numbers of blast cells with higher self-renewal capacity (secondary colonies on replating) than CFU-GEMM has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Evidence for the presence of multipotent HSC is also derived from the human &quot;Dexter&quot; technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] for liquid culture of marrow in which myeloid progenitors (mostly CFU-GM) are sustained for about two months on and within an adherent stromal monolayer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. The progenitors can be detected by replating into methyl-cellulose with several growth factors at five to eight weeks, thereby demonstrating that both unipotent and multipotent cells are generated in this culture system.</p><p>This long term culture technique has been adapted to a limiting dilution assay in which long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-IC) can be quantitated after culture at different concentrations on a stromal layer for five weeks followed by replating in methyl-cellulose to score for the number of wells that do not contain colonies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. An analogous cobblestone area forming cell (CAFC) assay has also been adapted to human cells by counting proliferating clones directly in the stromal layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]; the areas of active hematopoiesis have a &quot;cobblestone&quot; appearance. Last, an assay that measures the enormous proliferative capacity of primitive progenitor cells is the high proliferative potential colony forming cell (HPP-CFC) assay, that gives rise to macroscopically (&gt;5 mm) visible colonies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>While these in vitro assays measure properties attributable to HSC such as multipotency or great proliferative capacity, they cannot address the essential property of the ability of HSC to reconstitute long-term hematopoiesis. This property ideally requires an in vivo transplantation assay. A competitive repopulation assay, based upon transplanting an unknown stem cell population together with a standard dose of competing cells into irradiated recipient mice, has been developed in the mouse to quantitate murine HSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In addition, human HSC populations can be injected into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID or <span class=\"nowrap\">NOD/SCID)</span> mice which are monitored six to eight weeks later for evidence of human engraftment in the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>It is believed that this SCID repopulating cell (SRC) represents a cell closer to the HSC than cells measured in in vitro assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. A tentative relationship of the cells measured in these different assays of stem and progenitor cells is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77910 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cell surface antigenic markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cell surface characteristics have been used to purify or define populations of cells that include HSC and progenitors. For humans, the most frequently used markers are the CD34 antigen, expressed on HSC and progenitors, and CD38, expressed on a subset of more mature progenitors and on maturing cells, but <strong>not</strong> on HSC.</p><p>The most primitive human hematopoietic cells are CD34+ and CD38- [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. However, CD34+ cells comprise approximately 2 to 5 percent of nucleated cells in bone marrow, while HSC are much more rare (about 1 per 20,000 bone marrow cells). Thus, while markers such as CD34 are useful to enrich for primitive cells, their presence is only an indirect indication of the presence of HSC.</p><p>Addition of antibodies to other cell surface proteins expressed on HSC such as CD133, KIT, or CD150, in combination with exclusion of cells that express lineage markers (Lin-) can result in much greater enrichment of LT-HSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Using the <span class=\"nowrap\">NOD/SCID</span> mouse model, human hematopoiesis could be expressed in mouse marrow by <span class=\"nowrap\">CD34+/CD38-/lin-</span> cells expressing <span class=\"nowrap\">Flk2/Flt3</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Infusion of similar cells that were <span class=\"nowrap\">Flk2/Flt3</span> negative did not result in successful engraftment.</p><p>Other cell characteristics that have been used to define HSC populations include the ability to extrude vital dyes such as Rhodamine 123 (Rh-123-low) and Hoechst 33342 (side population cells), and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>].</p><p>Experiments using <span class=\"nowrap\">KIT+/lin-</span> cells or the Hoechst dye have raised the possibility that murine, primate and human HSC capable of long term reconstitution may be found in a CD34- fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. This possibility is controversial, however, since experimental and transplantation data suggest that HSC do express CD34 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/65-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-69</a>]. Two other studies have presented evidence that CD34 negative cells, isolated by monoclonal antibodies, have engraftment potential and marrow repopulating capacity in immune deficient animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. However, the significance of these studies for human HSC transplantation depended on the identification of markers for positive selection of these cells and the demonstration that they can repopulate human bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>Transplantation of highly enriched human HSC into immunodeficient mice has been achieved with a purification that exploits a different marker profile: CD34+, CD38-, CD45RA-, CD90+ (Thy1+), and CD49f+, with further enrichment (capacity for single cell engraftment) in a Rho- fraction of these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>].

However, transplantation requires myeloablation and most likely induces stress in the transplanted HSC. Experiments using transposons to label multiple hematopoietic cells in vivo with unique genetic markers known as &quot;barcodes&quot; have provided major insights into steady state non-stressed hematopoiesis; longitudinal analysis shows that hematopoiesis is maintained by thousands of clones, many with properties of ST-HSC and progenitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Tracing of LT-HSC fates using Tie2Cre to label the most primitive HSC during embryonic development also suggests that ST-HSCs make a more substantial steady state contribution to hematopoiesis than LT-HSCs, and that only approximately 30 percent of the latter cells are productive during the steady state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. </p><p>The traditional model of a hierarchy of differentiation from LT-HSC through the multipotent common myeloid and common lymphoid progenitors (CMP and CLP), with CMPs branching to megakaryocyte erythroid (MEP) and <span class=\"nowrap\">granulocyte/monocyte</span> progenitors (GMP) has been challenged. These multipotent progenitors were analyzed with additional markers that demonstrated heterogeneity within each of these populations. Single cell sorting and analysis of progeny after culture in multiple cytokines showed that during fetal development, megakaryocyte and erythroid commitment occurs at multipotent, oligopotent and unipotent stages of differentiation, while myeloid and <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphoid/monocyte</span> progenitors arise at the latter two stages only. In contrast, adult bone marrow is dominated by unilineage progenitors of mostly myeloid and erythroid potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">STEM CELL REGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The formed elements of the blood in vertebrates, including humans, continuously undergo replacement to maintain a constant number of red cells, white cells, and platelets. The number of cells of each type is maintained within a narrow range in the physiologically normal adult individual &mdash; approximately 5000 granulocytes, 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> red blood cells, and 150,000 to 300,000 platelets per microliter of whole blood. Regulatory mechanisms that maintain a balanced production of new blood cells are far from completely understood, but present evidence strongly supports the following basic principles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52024 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single multipotent stem cell is capable of giving rise to many committed progenitor cells, differentiated recognizable precursors of the specific types of blood cells, and mature cells by clonal proliferation. Furthermore, most multipotent stem cells are quiescent, and hematopoiesis appears to be sustained in the steady state by the progeny of only a small number of activated stem cells. The &quot;clonal succession&quot; hypothesis that a series of stem cells may contribute clones successively to maintain hematopoiesis throughout the life span of an individual is an attractive explanation for the existence of &quot;active&quot; and &quot;resting&quot; stem cell clones, and has strong but not unequivocal experimental support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In vivo labeling data with bromodeoxyuridine (brdU) suggest that approximately 8 percent of murine stem cells enter the cell cycle every day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>], making it appear more likely that stem cells regularly make the transition from a resting to an activated state.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The multipotent stem cell is capable of self-renewal, but this property may not be unlimited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/77,85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,85,86</a>]. Instead, the potential of HSC to self-renew is finite, determined by replicative history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>] and perhaps also by accumulation of damage to DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In addition to their limited proliferative potential, committed progenitors also &quot;die by differentiation&quot;, and their numbers depend upon influx from the multipotent stem cell pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Committed progenitor cells are capable of response to humoral or marrow stroma derived regulators, some produced in reaction to the circulating levels of a particular differentiated cell type.

In this response, the progenitor cells proliferate and differentiate to form the recognizable blood cells. Under this type of control, amplification of production occurs at the committed progenitor cell level. There is evidence that committed progenitors can self-renew. For example, BFU-E can increase in number under the influence of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>], which may underlie the rapid increase in erythropoiesis during stress.</p><p/><p>Most of the regulatory molecules are produced by hematopoietic accessory cells in close proximity to progenitor cells. These molecules are produced as part of an incompletely understood complex regulatory network operating at close range and may involve accessory cell-progenitor cell interactions. As an example, ectopic expression of G-CSF receptors in progenitor cells supports G-CSF dependent differentiation of these cells into mature granulocytes, macrophages, megakaryocytes and erythroid cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The cytoplasmic domain of the receptor is not necessary for this interaction since similar effects are produced by G-CSF when a chimeric receptor containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the G-CSF receptor fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor is substituted for G-CSF receptor.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematopoietic differentiation requires an appropriate microenvironment. In normal humans, this environment is confined to the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], whereas in the mouse the microenvironment includes both the spleen and bone marrow.

Interestingly, murine in vivo experiments showed that the absence of dietary valine led to loss of HSCs from the bone marrow niche and allowed donor HSC engraftment without the need for chemotherapy and radiation to myeloablate the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p/><p>A number of early hematopoietic cells, including the multipotent stem cells and certain committed progenitor cells, have been demonstrated in the circulation of normal individuals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> experimental animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/38,94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,94-96</a>]. HSC can also be found in the umbilical cord blood obtained from the placenta directly after delivery. Cord blood is enriched in stem cells compared with bone marrow or the peripheral circulation and can be used as a source for stem cell transplantation.

In one, self-renewal or differentiation is considered to occur in a random or stochastic manner, only dictated by a certain probability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/90,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,99</a>]. A contrasting model proposed that the hematopoietic microenvironment is inductive (HIM), based upon the observation that domains of a given lineage exist within single spleen colonies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. However, the preponderance of differentiating cells of one or other type within colonies appears to result from events that affect maturation rather than lineage commitment.</p><p>There is now much evidence that supports the stochastic or random model for both lineage commitment and restriction of differentiation potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/101-103\" class=\"abstract_t\">101-103</a>]. In this model, combinations of nuclear transcription factors have been characterized that play a role in the specification of stem cells from mesenchymal cells and in early stem cell proliferation, while other unique sets of transcription factors appear to be activated, perhaps randomly. These transcription factors are essential for the development of the different cell lineages because they dictate the synthesis of lineage specific proteins such as cell surface growth factor receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/104-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">104-106</a>]. The possible role of extrinsic factors (such as leukopenia or anemia) in the regulation of stem cell levels is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>]. </p><p>The expression of transcription factors and the critical genes regulated by them during hematopoiesis are dependent on the state of the surrounding DNA and may be influenced by epigenetic changes (eg, variation in DNA and chromatin that does not involve sequence change) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Methylation of cytosine in the context of CpG dinucleotides is associated with transcriptional repression, while unmethylated CpG islands are found in actively transcribed promoters. A variety of post-translational modifications to histone tails correlate with distal enhancer and promoter activation and repression. Changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications are important in the regulation of HSC self-renewal and differentiation as well as the developmental changes that occur with fetal development and stem cell aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/110,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,111</a>].

The original murine approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>] involved the delivery of only four genes, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC to fibroblasts.

With respect to therapeutic applications, a practical goal of these studies is to derive HSC that can be used for transplantation, but this remains a major challenge. As discussed above, the in vivo SCID repopulating cell (SRC) assay in immunodeficient mice is the most valuable surrogate measure of long-term hematopoietic reconstitution, and results using both hESC and iPS cells show only low levels of engraftment.
