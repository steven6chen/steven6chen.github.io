Low blood sugar, which is also called &quot;hypoglycemia,&quot; happens when the level of sugar in a person's blood gets too low.</p><p>Low blood sugar can happen in people with diabetes (sometimes called &quot;diabetes mellitus&quot;) who take certain diabetes medicines, including insulin and some types of pills.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667081292\"><span class=\"h1\">When can people with diabetes get low blood sugar?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with diabetes can get low blood sugar when they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take too much medicine, including insulin or certain diabetes pills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not eat enough food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise too much without eating a snack or reducing their insulin dose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wait too long between meals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink too much alcohol</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667081299\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of low blood sugar?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of low blood sugar can be different from person to person, and can change over time. During the early stages of low blood sugar, a person can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweat or tremble</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel hungry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel worried</p><p/><p>People who have early symptoms should check their blood sugar level to see if it is low and needs to be treated. If low blood sugar levels are not treated, severe symptoms can occur. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking or feeling weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble seeing clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being confused or acting in a strange way</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out or having a seizure</p><p/><p>Some people do not get symptoms during the early stages of low blood sugar. Doctors call this &quot;hypoglycemia unawareness.&quot; People with hypoglycemia unawareness are more likely to have severe symptoms, because they might not know that they have low blood sugar until they have severe symptoms. Hypoglycemia unawareness often occurs in people who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have had type 1 diabetes for more than 5 to 10 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use insulin to keep their blood sugar level under tight control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink a lot of alcohol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take certain medicines for high blood pressure or diabetes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667081306\"><span class=\"h1\">How is low blood sugar treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low blood sugar can be treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quick sources of sugar &ndash; People can treat low blood sugar by eating or drinking quick sources of sugar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71872 \">table 1</a>). Foods that have fat, such as chocolate or cheese, do not treat low blood sugar as quickly. You and a family member should carry a quick source of sugar at all times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;glucagon&quot; shot &ndash; Glucagon is a hormone that can quickly raise blood sugar levels and stop severe symptoms. It comes in the form of a shot. If your doctor recommends that you carry a glucagon shot with you, he or she will tell you when and how to use it. Family members should also learn how to give a glucagon shot. That way a family member can give it to you if you can't do it yourself (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74461\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74461 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50427\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50427 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61722 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667081313\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment for low blood sugar, most people can get back to their usual routine. But your doctor or nurse might recommend that you check your blood sugar level more often during the next 2 to 3 days.</p><p>If your low blood sugar was treated with a glucagon shot, call your doctor or nurse. He or she might change the dose of your diabetes medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667081320\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I prevent low blood sugar?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best way to prevent low blood sugar is to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your blood sugar levels often &ndash; Your doctor or nurse will tell you how and when to check your blood sugar levels at home. He or she will also tell you what your blood sugar levels should be, and when to treat low blood sugar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn the symptoms of low blood sugar and be ready to treat it in the early stages. Treating low blood sugar early can prevent severe symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667081327\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I go to a hospital or call for an ambulance?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A family member or friend should take you to a hospital or <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are still confused 15 minutes after being treated with a glucagon shot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have passed out and there is no glucagon shot nearby</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Still have low blood sugar after treatment</p><p/><p>If you have low blood sugar, do not try to drive yourself to the hospital. Driving with low blood sugar can be dangerous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667081334\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=using-insulin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Using insulin (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatment for type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-low-blood-sugar-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Self-monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-1-insulin-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 1: Insulin treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-insulin-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Insulin treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
