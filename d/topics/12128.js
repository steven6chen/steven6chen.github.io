It causes vision loss and can even lead to blindness. There are different types of glaucoma. The most common type in the United States is called &quot;chronic open-angle glaucoma.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7832350\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of open-angle glaucoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At first, open-angle glaucoma does not usually cause symptoms. When it does cause vision loss, it starts by affecting the edges of what you see (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77916 \">picture 1</a>). In other words, the center of what you look at often looks clear. But things that are off to the side do not. This is sometimes called &quot;tunnel vision.&quot; As the disease gets worse, even your central vision can be affected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7832357\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for open-angle glaucoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for open-angle glaucoma, doctors can use a few different tests. They can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look into the back of your eye with a lighted magnifying tool and see if there are signs of nerve damage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check how well you see things in the center of your vision and how well you see things that are off to the side</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check the pressure inside your eye by pushing or blowing on your eye with a special tool (people with open-angle glaucoma often have too much pressure inside the eye)</p><p/><p>Everyone age 40 and older should be tested for open-angle glaucoma at least once. You might need more frequent tests if you have a parent, brother, or sister who has glaucoma. Testing helps doctors find and treat the disease early, before it causes symptoms. That's important, because treatment for open-angle glaucoma can prevent or slow down vision loss. But it cannot undo damage that has already been done.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7832364\"><span class=\"h1\">How is open-angle glaucoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective treatments for open-angle glaucoma all work by lowering the pressure inside the eye. There are 3 ways to lower eye pressure: eye drops, laser therapy, or surgery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye drop medicines &ndash; There are 2 main types of glaucoma eye drops:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prostaglandins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Beta blockers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laser therapy &ndash; Laser therapy improves the way fluid drains from the eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Surgery involves making a small opening or inserting a tiny tube in the eye so that fluid can drain better.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7832371\"><span class=\"h1\">Which treatment should I have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experts recommend that all people start by using eye drops. Some people might need to use 2 different eye drop medicines.</p><p>If your doctor prescribes eye drops, it's very important that you use them every day, as directed. These eye drops can keep you from losing your vision. But they only work if you follow the instructions on how to use them. There are now medicines that you can use just once a day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7832378\"><span class=\"h1\">What if drops don't work for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you try a few different eye drop medicines, and they do not lower your eye pressure enough, your doctor might suggest laser therapy, or as a last option, surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7832475\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-vision-loss-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related vision loss (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=age-related-macular-degeneration-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Age-related macular degeneration (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataracts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cataracts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diabetic retinopathy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=angle-closure-glaucoma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Angle-closure glaucoma (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
