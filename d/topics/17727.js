In patients with the salt-losing form of the disorder, mineralocorticoid is given to restore serum electrolyte concentrations and extracellular fluid volume to normal.

Prenatal diagnosis also has been performed if prenatal therapy is contemplated. However, because adverse effects of prenatal therapy (on the fetus and mother) have been described and long-term risks are unknown, the decision to treat should only be considered in consultation with a highly experienced team in a research setting and after a detailed discussion with the pregnant couple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Very early initiation of therapy is required because virilization of affected female fetuses begins as early as four weeks of gestation. Unfortunately, molecular diagnosis of CAH is not possible until 8 to 12 weeks of gestation. Since the risk of having an affected female fetus is only one in eight when both parents are known carriers, seven in eight fetuses will receive treatment who in retrospect are not affected females.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technique &ndash; Prenatal treatment consists of maternal administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a>, which is not degraded by the placenta and crosses into the fetal circulation. This treatment is most effective in preventing abnormal genital development in affected female fetuses when it is initiated as soon as pregnancy is recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. If treatment cannot be begun by nine weeks of gestation, it should not be given at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. If treatment is initiated, fetal sex and genotype should be determined as soon as possible, and treatment should be discontinued if testing reveals a male fetus or an unaffected female. Fetal sex can be determined as early as five weeks gestation by testing circulating cell-free fetal DNA in the maternal circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; however, this test is not routinely available. Molecular diagnosis of CAH can be determined by rapid genotyping of fetal cells obtained by chorionic villus sampling at 8 to 10 weeks of gestation. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Efficacy &ndash; Approximately 85 percent of prenatally treated female infants are born with normal or only slightly virilized genitalia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The virilization is probably less significant than occurs in untreated female infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Hypotonic saline <strong>should not be used</strong> because it can worsen the hyponatremia; the same is true of 5 percent dextrose without the addition of normal saline.

It is important to use the lowest effective glucocorticoid dose because excessive dosing reduces linear growth. </p><p>For older adolescents and adults, long-acting glucocorticoids such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> are often the preferred treatment due to the convenience of less frequent dosing. However, the longer duration of action and greater potency may increase the risk of overtreatment, restricting linear growth if given prior to epiphyseal closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,33,34</a>]. Dexamethasone is usually given once daily at a dose of 0.25 to 0.50 mg, preferably at bedtime, but a twice-daily regimen may be needed in some patients. A glucocorticoid that is inactivated by the placenta (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a>, prednisone or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a>) is preferred in sexually active women. Prednisone is given at a daily dose of 5 to 7.5 mg, divided into two doses. Similar to hydrocortisone, higher doses are sometimes needed and treatment should be individualized.</p><p>Because the results of therapy are frequently suboptimal in terms of eventual adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>], long-acting glucocorticoids such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> have raised particular concerns (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Growth'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Menstrual cycle'</a> below). However, some studies suggest that treatment with these drugs does not necessarily limit growth. One study of 26 children treated with dexamethasone (average dose 0.27 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> every morning) for an average of seven years demonstrated normal growth and control of androgen secretion with normal sexual maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

It is possible that the doses used in these studies were sufficiently low to avoid the growth-suppressing effects. However, because of ongoing concerns about growth, hydrocortisone remains the glucocorticoid of choice and the standard of care during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1,2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Mineralocorticoid and sodium chloride</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mineralocorticoid replacement is recommended in all patients who have the classic form of CAH, whether or not it is the salt-losing form. Although mineralocorticoid deficiency may only appear clinically apparent in the salt-losing form, aldosterone secretion has been shown to be impaired in the simple-virilizing form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>] and mineralocorticoid treatment has been associated with improved height outcome in patients with classic CAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. The need for mineralocorticoid replacement should be periodically reassessed, since sensitivity to mineralocorticoids may vary over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Mineralocorticoid is given as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fludrocortisone</a>, in a dose sufficient to restore normal serum sodium and potassium concentrations, and plasma renin activity should be maintained within the normal range. Excessive dosing can induce hypertension, hypokalemia, and possibly, impaired growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], while underdosing also can lead to poor growth with failure-to-thrive. This may be in part because inadequate mineralocorticoid replacement increases the glucocorticoid replacement requirement, impairing growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. In addition, inadequate mineralocorticoid replacement may lead to increased adrenal androgen production. This is because patients may be chronically volume-depleted, which is clinically inapparent but results in persistent overproduction of renin and angiotensin II. Angiotensin II stimulates vasopressin and ACTH, leading to higher adrenal androgen synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. For all of these reasons, mineralocorticoid therapy appears to benefit patients with either the classic salt-losing form or the classic non-salt-losing (simple-virilizing) form of 21-hydroxylase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>The usual pediatric dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fludrocortisone</a> is 50 to 200 mcg per day (0.05 to 0.20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Infants require higher doses of fludrocortisone and also require sodium chloride supplementation of 1 to 3 g per day (about 17 to 51 mEq per day or 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg/day)</span> distributed in several feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Fludrocortisone doses typically require dose reduction after 6 to 12 months of age because sensitivity to mineralocorticoid increases as the kidneys mature in the first year of life; dose reduction should be guided by measurement of plasma renin activity and blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>Salt <span class=\"nowrap\">tablets/solution</span> can be discontinued as the child begins to eat table food and the taste for salty food increases. Additional salt intake may be needed with exposure to hot weather or with intense exercise. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The response to therapy should be evaluated monthly in the first three months of life, every three months in the neonate and infant, and every three to six months thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. More frequent monitoring is sometimes clinically indicated. Response to therapy is monitored by measuring serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, plasma renin activity or direct renin, as well as growth velocity, blood pressure, and the rate of skeletal maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/26,50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,50-53</a>]. Measurement of testosterone is sometimes useful in patients whose disease is not well controlled. Decreased mineralocorticoid sensitivity is present in infancy; thus, it is essential to reassess mineralocorticoid status and adjust the replacement dose as needed during the first 18 months of life. Blood samples for monitoring therapy should be obtained at a consistent time in relation to glucocorticoid dosing, optimally in the morning to reflect peak <span class=\"nowrap\">serum/plasma</span> concentrations but before the glucocorticoid dose is taken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1,13,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,29</a>]. Normative laboratory data for age and sexual maturation should be used in the interpretation of all laboratory tests; normative data may vary depending upon the laboratory.</p><p>Appropriate target ranges are a serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration of 400 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (12 to 36 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> and serum androstenedione concentrations appropriate for the patient's age and sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Adrenal androgen secretion should not be completely suppressed; normal levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone generally indicate overtreatment. These serum tests serve as markers of the adequacy of treatment and of patient adherence to it, and along with the growth record provide the basis for adjustments in the doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a>. Simply adjusting the glucocorticoid dose to normalize the serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone value is insufficient because of the risk of iatrogenic Cushing syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and since androgen excess may persist because of avid adrenal conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone to androgens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. </p><p>Plasma renin should be monitored and kept in the normal range for age. A suppressed plasma renin activity reflects overtreatment and places the patient at risk for hypertension. In a prospective study of 33 patients with classic CAH diagnosed by newborn screen, over one-half experienced hypertension in the first 18 months, and hypertension was associated with higher <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fludrocortisone</a> doses and lower plasma renin activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In a population-study of children with CAH (n = 716, age range 3 to 18 years), patients with renin regularly measured had lower blood pressure than those missing renin documentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In patients with ongoing salt loss, elevated plasma renin activity, the first step is to adjust the fludrocortisone <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the exogenous salt doses to decrease renin, before increasing the glucocorticoid dose. </p><p>Patients with significant elevations of androstenedione or testosterone levels due to poor compliance may respond more rapidly to a limited 7- to 10-day course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> administered in supraphysiologic doses, followed by the standard replacement doses. It is essential that the high-dose course be brief to avoid compromising growth and increasing weight.</p><p>Alternative measurements include urinary metabolites (pregnanetriol) or salivary hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,58</a>]. The measurements of bone age and growth rate reflect long-term control; bone age should be obtained at least once a year after two years of age or every six months if advanced for chronologic age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29</a>]. Ideally, treatment should be modified well before there is evidence of reduced growth rate or advanced bone age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In practice, however, this may not be a simple matter. As an example, in a randomized trial in 26 children, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> at a dose of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day caused significant slowing of growth over the course of one year, compared with 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, at the lower dose there was often incomplete suppression of androgen secretion. Thus, the patient's symptoms and signs of androgen excess, steroid measurements, and growth and development all need to be considered. </p><p>Patients with CAH are at risk for early central puberty. Central precocious puberty is most likely to develop when the diagnosis of CAH is delayed or when adrenal androgen secretion is poorly controlled; such patients may benefit from treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In boys with CAH, the onset of central puberty has been closely linked to a bone age of 12 years to 12 years 6 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], but no clear association has been identified in girls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenal crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine illnesses may become life-threatening in children with CAH unless their glucocorticoid regimen is appropriately modified.

If a patient is unable to tolerate oral medication, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> should be given intramuscularly, and medical advice should be promptly sought. Increased doses of glucocorticoids are not required for mild illnesses without fever, emotional stress (eg, school examinations), or before physical exercise. </p><p>Illnesses that are associated with diarrhea or vomiting and impaired oral intake require assessment by a medical team, and possibly the administration of parenteral glucocorticoids, saline, and glucose until resumption of adequate oral intake. Patients with CAH and febrile illnesses are at risk for hypoglycemia, especially in young children and if oral intake is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In the early phase of treatment, infants may require 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> of hydrocortisone, but stress doses of up to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> may be needed temporarily to reduce markedly elevated adrenal hormones. Longer acting glucocorticoid preparations increase the risk for growth failure but may be used in some adolescents and adults. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Positive newborn screen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mineralocorticoid replacement is necessary in all pediatric patients who have classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Mineralocorticoid replacement can often be tapered after four to six months of age. Caution should be used, especially in the first 18 months of life, to avoid inducing hypertension as the neonatal kidney matures and becomes more sensitive to mineralocorticoids. Dosing should be guided by measurement of plasma renin activity and blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Mineralocorticoid and sodium chloride'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Response to therapy is monitored by measuring serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, plasma renin activity or direct renin, as well as growth velocity (measured by serial measurements of height), blood pressure, and the rate of skeletal maturation. Laboratory and clinical monitoring should be performed every month in the neonate and infant, and every three to six months thereafter. Bone age should be measured at least annually after two years of age until skeletal maturity. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and children with classic CAH are at risk for developing an adrenal crisis, which is characterized by hypotension or shock, and electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and hypoglycemia) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61357 \">table 1</a>). Adrenal crisis can be triggered by significant physical stress or illness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonadherence to treatment. To avoid an adrenal crisis, patients with CAH should be treated with stress doses of glucocorticoids when they become ill with fever or gastroenteritis, or undergo surgery with general anesthesia or trauma. Fasting should be avoided, especially in the young child. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Adrenal crisis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult height in patients with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency is modestly decreased as compared with reference groups. The best established approach to optimizing linear growth is judicious dosing of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid dosing and close monitoring to avoid under- and over-treatment.
