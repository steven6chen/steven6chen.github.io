The risk is related to patient- and surgery-specific characteristics. Identification of increased risk provides the patient (and surgeon) with information that helps them better understand the benefit-to-risk ratio of a procedure and may lead to interventions that decrease risk.</p><p>This topic will review the initial preoperative cardiac evaluation, which includes an attempt to quantify risk. The management of cardiac risk (in an attempt to reduce morbidity and mortality) and issues related to the perioperative evaluation and management of heart failure or myocardial infarction (MI) are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Revised cardiac risk index'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>A 2016 study, using information in a large administrative database of United States hospital admissions (2004 to 2013), found a 3 percent incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (in-hospital, all-cause death, acute MI, or acute ischemic stroke) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These events were most common after vascular, thoracic, and transplant surgery.</p><p>Patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, including peripheral artery disease or stroke, have an increased risk of perioperative cardiac complications compared with patients without extant atherosclerosis for two reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They constitute a selected population with a high incidence of significant coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In addition, left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction &le;40 percent) is five times more common in patients with cerebrovascular disease or peripheral artery disease compared with matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic factors associated with surgery predisposed to myocardial ischemia, which is more pronounced in patients with underlying coronary disease. These include volume shifts and blood loss, enhanced myocardial oxygen demand from elevations in heart rate and blood pressure secondary to stress from surgery, and an increase in postoperative platelet reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the increased risk in the population with vascular disease, the rates of MI and death have been falling significantly. For example, perioperative mortality after carotid endarterectomy is approximately 1 percent and for abdominal aortic aneurysm repair is &lt;3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H327722933\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients scheduled to undergo noncardiac surgery should have an assessment of the risk of a cardiovascular perioperative cardiac event (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F96563\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96563 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The purpose of this assessment is to help the patient and health care providers weigh the benefits and risks of the surgery and optimize the timing of the surgery. On occasion, risk assessment will uncover undiagnosed problems or suboptimally treated prior conditions that need attention. The clinician uses information obtained from the history, physical examination, and type of surgery in order to develop an initial estimate of perioperative cardiac risk. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Initial preoperative evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Risk models estimate the risk based on information obtained from the history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and type of surgery. When assessing preoperative cardiac risk, we use either the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI), also referred to as the Lee index (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57075 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], or the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) risk model <a href=\"http://www.surgicalriskcalculator.com/miorcardiacarrest&amp;token=p4y9/Ch+Tlmu4ELAgP+rShl8G8WmZJqGldKEBM7ELFh2LdZPjPIm74G0kRdve8zI8WQ4HPyt9HSRedY6UWxqyA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6616\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">calculator</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The RCRI is simpler and has been widely used and validated over the past 15 years. The NSQIP calculator is more complex, requiring calculation through an online tool, and has yet to be validated in other populations. A simpler tool also derived from the NSQIP database is the Gupta myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest (MICA) calculator. Practitioners should become familiar with one model and use it regularly. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Estimating perioperative risk'</a> below.)</p><p>These models provide the user with the risk of a cardiac complication in percent. For patients at low risk (&lt;1 percent), no further testing is indicated. For patients at higher risk, caregivers need to ask the question whether further cardiovascular testing will change management and hopefully improve the outcome. In most cases, the reason to perform additional testing will be based not on the desire to lower risk at the time of surgery but rather lowering long-term risk. That is, the patient should have additional testing done irrespective of the need for surgery. There are few circumstances in which testing should be performed solely because the patient has upcoming surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H418242309\"><span class=\"h2\">Very high-risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with recent MI (60 days) or unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, high-grade arrhythmias, or hemodynamically important valvular heart disease (aortic stenosis in particular) are at very high risk for perioperative MI, heart failure, ventricular fibrillation or primary cardiac arrest, complete heart block, and cardiac death. All such patients should be optimally treated, with possible referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiac-surgery-in-patients-with-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiac surgery in patients with aortic stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-heart-failure-in-patients-undergoing-noncardiac-surgery#H694557462\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of heart failure in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Risk classification by heart failure syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H418242507\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergency or urgent surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who require emergency or urgent surgery are at increased risk of a perioperative cardiovascular event at any level of baseline risk. In these cases, risk indices derived from elective surgery cohorts are not accurate, although they may provide an estimate of the minimal risk.</p><p>In many cases, there is not sufficient time for an extensive evaluation of the severity of a patient&rsquo;s cardiovascular problem, and in most cases the benefit of proceeding with surgery outweighs the risk of waiting to perform additional testing. In the absence of preoperative assessment because of the minimal time available before surgery, clinicians must be available postoperatively to help manage the possible cardiovascular complications in at-risk patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a determination is made that noncardiac surgery will be considered, the patient should be evaluated for the risk of a cardiovascular complication. This evaluation is generally performed by a primary care clinician. The information obtained is used to assess risk. In patients assessed to be at elevated (intermediate or high) cardiovascular risk, a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation may be indicated.</p><p>At the time of the initial preoperative evaluation, the clinician should inquire about symptoms such as angina, dyspnea, syncope, and palpitations as well as a history of heart disease, including ischemic, valvular, or cardiomyopathic disease, and a history of hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cerebrovascular or peripheral artery disease.</p><p>In addition, cardiac functional status should be determined. Functional status can be expressed in metabolic equivalents (1 MET is defined as 3.5 mL O2 <span class=\"nowrap\">uptake/kg</span> per min, which is the resting oxygen uptake in a sitting position). Various activity scales provide the clinician with a set of questions to determine a patient's functional capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Indicators of functional status include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can take care of self, such as eat, dress, or use the toilet (1 MET)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can walk up a flight of steps or a hill or walk on level ground at 3 to 4 mph (4 METs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can do heavy work around the house, such as scrubbing floors or lifting or moving heavy furniture, or climb two flights of stairs (between 4 and 10 METs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can participate in strenuous sports such as swimming, singles tennis, football, basketball, and skiing (&gt;10 METs)</p><p/><p>One important indicator of poor functional status and an increased risk of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications after major noncardiac surgery is the inability to climb two flights of stairs or walk four blocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. However, in patients with limitations to walking such as orthopedic problems, it may be hard to assess cardiac functional status. One may use bicycle or arm ergometry stress testing to evaluate a patient&rsquo;s functional capacity when the inability to walk limits testing.</p><p>The physical examination should focus on the cardiovascular system and include blood pressure measurements, auscultation of the heart and lungs, abdominal palpation, and examination of the extremities for edema and vascular integrity. Important findings include evidence of heart failure or a murmur suspicious for hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors used in risk prediction models'</a> below.)</p><p>Similar to recommendations made in the 2014 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> and European Society of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/European</span> Society of Anesthesiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ESC/ESA)</span> guidelines on noncardiac surgery, we obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) in many patients with known cardiovascular disease, significant arrhythmia, or significant structural heart disease unless the patient is undergoing low-risk surgery (surgery associated with less than 1 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">morbidity/mortality</span> such as ambulatory surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/9,10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,17</a>]. A preoperative ECG can be obtained in asymptomatic patients without known cardiovascular disease, but it is rarely helpful. Some ECG abnormalities seem to be associated with a worse prognosis in observational studies, but the association is inconsistent across studies. ECG abnormalities are not part of either the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) or the National Surgical Quality Improvement Plan (NSQIP) because of the lack of prognostic specificity associated with these findings. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Estimating perioperative risk'</a> below.)</p><p>The rationale for obtaining a preoperative ECG comes from the utility of having a baseline ECG should a postoperative ECG be abnormal.</p><p>For those patients who receive a preoperative ECG, it should be evaluated for the presence of Q waves or significant ST-segment elevation or depression, which raises the possibility of myocardial ischemia or infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, QTc prolongation, bundle-branch block, or arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS USED IN RISK PREDICTION MODELS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following clinical and surgery-specific factors are associated with an increase in perioperative risk of a cardiovascular event and are used in one or both of the models discussed below (revised cardiac risk index [RCRI] or the Gupta myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest [MICA] calculator derived from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Plan [NSQIP]). The newer NSQIP calculator includes 20 patient risk factors in addition to the surgical procedure (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Estimating perioperative risk'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery-specific risk (RCRI and NSQIP) &ndash; The reported rate of cardiac death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) is more than 5 percent in high-risk procedures, between 1 and 5 percent in intermediate-risk procedures, and less than 1 percent in low-risk procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F116645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116645 \">table 2</a>). Institutional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> individual surgeon experience with the procedure may increase or lower the risk. Emergency surgery is associated with particularly high risk, as cardiac complications are two to five times more likely than with elective procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57828\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57828 \">table 3</a>). This issue is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preanesthesia-evaluation-for-noncardiac-surgery#H2810882344\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preanesthesia evaluation for noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Surgical risk'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of ischemic heart disease (RCRI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of heart failure (RCRI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of cerebrovascular disease (RCRI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (RCRI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative serum creatinine &ge;2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (RCRI) or &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (NSQIP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing age (NQSIP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>American Society of Anesthesiologist class (NSQIP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative functional status (NSQIP).</p><p/><p>The value of these risk indicators may be diminishing over time, as the cardiovascular risk of surgery is declining. For example, in a large study of noncardiac surgery, neither the presence of history of coronary artery disease, transient ischemic attack history, nor diabetes predicted three-day mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This may result from the changing nature of postoperative MI, from a type 1, plaque rupture, MI to a type 2, hemodynamic MI. In the PeriOperative ISchemic Evaluation (POISE) trial of 8351 patients at high risk for or with atherosclerosis undergoing noncardiac surgery, only 35 (0.4 percent) required coronary revascularization postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, the value of risk prediction models may be waning as the end point of interest decreases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Other clinical predictors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While not included in the risk factors above, the following patient characteristics have been associated with increased risk:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atrial fibrillation</strong> &ndash; A retrospective, administrative database study demonstrated an association between a history of prior admission for atrial fibrillation and postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The risk associated with atrial fibrillation was higher than that associated with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obesity</strong> &ndash; Obese patients are at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events at the time of noncardiac surgery. However, obesity has not been shown to be a predictor independent of end-organ damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-weight-reduction-and-cardiovascular-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity, weight reduction, and cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Coronary disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The issue of whether the preoperative approach to obese patients should differ from that in the general population is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATING PERIOPERATIVE RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history, physical examination, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) identify patient-specific risk factors. This information, combined with the risk associated with the surgery, is used to estimate perioperative risk of adverse cardiac events (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97966\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97966 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>The risk will determine whether surgery should proceed without further cardiovascular testing; be postponed pending further testing such as stress testing or echocardiography; be changed to a lesser risk procedure (if possible) or a non-surgical alternative (eg, radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy or palliative care); or be cancelled so that a procedure such as coronary revascularization or heart valve replacement can take place. Multivariable analyses have identified combinations of factors that can be used to estimate perioperative risk&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Perioperative risk is expressed as the likelihood (in percent) that a patient will suffer a cardiac complication at the time of noncardiac surgery.</p><p>Models such as the revised cardiac risk index (RCRI) and the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) risk prediction calculators (Gupta myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest [MICA] or Bilimoria ACS surgical risk calculator) have included patients with high-risk characteristics and who have been managed with more current standards of care. For these reasons, we suggest using one of these models. The MICA calculator outperformed the RCRI in some circumstances, and the newer NSQIP surgical risk calculator is more comprehensive and procedure-specific. However, as mentioned previously, neither of these has yet to be validated externally. Furthermore, direct comparison of the various tools is difficult due to their different definitions of risk factors, complications, and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Therefore, the optimal tool likely reflects local factors related to incorporation into the preoperative workflow. </p><p>We do not recommend using older models such as the original Goldman cardiac risk index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], the Detsky modified risk index, or the Eagle criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-30</a>].

Among over 200,000 patients who underwent surgery in 2007, 0.65 percent developed perioperative MI or cardiac arrest.

In the derivation of the index, 2893 patients (mean age 66) undergoing elective major noncardiac procedures (with an expected length of stay &gt;2 days) were monitored for major cardiac complications (cardiac death, acute MI, pulmonary edema, ventricular <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrillation/cardiac</span> arrest, and complete heart block) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57075 \">table 1</a>). The index was validated in a cohort of 1422 similar individuals. The predictive value was significant in all types of elective major noncardiac surgery except for abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68956 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>A 2009 systematic review evaluated the ability of the RCRI to predict cardiac complications and mortality after major noncardiac surgery in various populations and settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The RCRI performed moderately well in distinguishing patients at low compared with high risk for all types of noncardiac surgery but was somewhat less accurate in patients undergoing only vascular noncardiac surgery. In addition, RCRI did not predict all-cause mortality well. However, this is expected, as it does not capture risk factors for noncardiac causes of perioperative mortality and only one-third of perioperative deaths are due to cardiac causes.</p><p>The risk of major cardiac complications (cardiac death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal cardiac arrest, postoperative cardiogenic pulmonary edema, complete heart block) varied according to the number of risk factors.

In multivariate analysis of the VSGNE cohort, independent predictors of adverse cardiac events (MI, arrhythmia, and heart failure, but not mortality) were increasing age (odds ratio [OR] 1.7 to 2.8), smoking (OR 1.3), insulin-dependent diabetes (OR 1.4), coronary artery disease (OR 1.4), coronary heart failure (OR 1.9), abnormal cardiac stress test (OR 1.2), long-term beta-blocker therapy (OR 1.4), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.6), and creatinine &ge;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (OR 1.7).

This model had excellent performance for mortality (C statistic = 0.944; Brier score = 0.011 [where scores approaching 0 are better]), morbidity (C statistic = 0.816, Brier score = 0.069), and six additional complications (C statistics &gt;0.8).

Often, these are patients with known or suspected coronary artery or valvular heart disease. Further evaluation may include stress testing or echocardiography, or cardiologist consultation. We generally perform these tests if they are indicated for the patient even if they were not having surgery. Many studies of patients not at low risk have shown that performing some form of stress testing can further stratify the risk of an adverse perioperative event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery/abstract/22,28,29,37-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28,29,37-46</a>].

In this approach, the patient&rsquo;s functional capacity plays an important role (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F96563\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96563 \">algorithm 1</a>). In patients who can perform &ge;4 METs of activity, we do not order additional tests.
