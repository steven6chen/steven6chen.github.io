It is one of the top five causes of maternal mortality in both high and low per capita income countries, although the absolute risk of death from PPH is much lower in high-income countries. Timely diagnosis, appropriate resources, and appropriate management are critical for preventing death.</p><p>This topic will present an overview of major issues relating to PPH. Clinical use of specific medical and minimally invasive interventions, and surgical interventions at laparotomy, for management of PPH are discussed separately (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Management approaches requiring laparotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3044772299\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PPH occurring in the first 24 hours after delivery is occasionally called primary or early PPH, and is the subject of this topic. PPH occurring from 24 hours to 12 weeks after delivery is usually called secondary, late, or delayed PPH, and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-late-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary (late) postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100822707\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of PPH varies widely, depending upon the criteria used to diagnose the disorder. A reasonable estimate is 1 to 5 percent of deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In an analysis of population-based data from the United States National Inpatient Sample, the incidence was between 2 and 3 percent during the years 1994 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and 3 percent in 2012 to 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS THAT LIMIT POSTPARTUM BLOOD LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential for massive hemorrhage after delivery is high because, in late pregnancy, uterine artery blood flow is 500 to 700 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and accounts for approximately 15 percent of cardiac output. Normally, hemostasis occurs upon placental separation because uterine bleeding is controlled by a combination of two mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraction of the myometrium, which compresses the blood vessels supplying the placental bed and causes mechanical hemostasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local decidual hemostatic factors (tissue factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], systemic coagulation factors [eg, platelets, circulating clotting factors]), which cause clotting.</p><p/><p>The pathogenesis of most cases of PPH is a disturbance in one or both of these mechanisms. The pathogenesis for most of the remaining PPH cases is loss of intact vasculature (ie, trauma).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100822458\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100823213\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal or diffuse atony</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony (ie, lack of effective contraction of the uterus after delivery), which complicates 1 in 40 births in the United States and is responsible for at least 75 percent of cases of PPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The diagnosis of atony is generally made when the uterus does not become firm after routine management of the third stage of labor (ie, uterine massage and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>). Atony may or may not be associated with retained tissue. Placental disorders (eg, morbidly adherent placenta, placenta previa, abruptio placentae), retained products of conception, and uterine inversion result in PPH because they inhibit effective uterine contraction, either focally or diffusely.</p><p>With diffuse atony, blood loss can be much greater than observed because a flaccid and dilated uterus may contain a significant amount of blood. With focal localized atony, the fundal region may be well contracted while the lower uterine segment is dilated (ballooning) and atonic, which is difficult to appreciate on abdominal examination, but may be detected on vaginal examination.</p><p>Although diffuse uterine atony is the most common cause of PPH, it is often responsive to administration of additional uterotonic drugs; thus, it is not the most common reason for massive transfusion at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100823219\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma-related bleeding can be due to lacerations (including uterine rupture) or surgical incisions.</p><p>Cervical and vaginal lacerations may develop as a result of the natural processes of delivery or may be related to provider interventions. They may not be noted until excessive postpartum vaginal bleeding prompts lower genital tract examination, including examination for vaginal and vulvar hematomas.</p><p>Corpus lacerations may be complete transmyometrial ruptures or incomplete lacerations of the inner myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rupture-of-the-unscarred-uterus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rupture of the unscarred uterus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-rupture-after-previous-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine rupture after previous cesarean delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At cesarean delivery, hemorrhage from the uterine incision is generally caused by lateral extension of the incision, which can result from spontaneous tearing of an edematous lower segment during an otherwise uneventful cesarean delivery after prolonged labor, from an incision made too low or not sufficiently curved on the lower segment, or from delivery of the fetus through an incision that is too small. Bleeding from lateral extension of the uterine incision is readily ascertained by inspection of the incision, lateral pelvic sidewalls, and broad ligament. Retroperitoneal enlargement and bulging of the broad ligament at cesarean delivery can be signs of retroperitoneal hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100823243\"><span class=\"h2\">Coagulopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coagulopathy is a cause of PPH in women with an inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis, and a result of PPH when there is a severe reduction of clotting factors due to persistent heavy bleeding and hemodilution of the remaining clotting factors. Acute coagulopathies can be caused by amniotic fluid embolism, placental abruption, preeclampsia with severe features, or HELLP syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS AND SPECIFIC ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many risk factors for PPH have been reported and are often interdependent.

Although PPH is classically defined by the volume of blood loss (ie, estimated blood loss &ge;500 mL after vaginal birth or &ge;1000 mL after cesarean delivery), this diagnosis is problematic because the mean blood loss reported after vaginal and cesarean deliveries is approximately 400 to 600 mL and 1000 mL, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>], bleeding may not be visible externally, or blood in collection devices may be mixed with amniotic fluid. </p><p>In 2017, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists revised their definition of PPH from the classic one (&ge;500 mL after vaginal birth or &ge;1000 mL after cesarean delivery) to (1) cumulative blood loss &ge;1000 mL <strong>or</strong> (2) bleeding associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> of hypovolemia within 24 hours of the birth process regardless of delivery route in order to reduce the number of women inappropriately labeled with this diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2087569932\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of severity of hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant drops in blood pressure are generally not manifested until substantial bleeding has occurred, and up to 25 percent of a patient's blood volume (&ge;1500 mL in pregnancy) can be lost before blood pressure falls and heart rate rises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

The following classes were derived from nonpregnant populations and may be somewhat different in postpartum women:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class I hemorrhage involves a blood volume loss of up to 15 percent. The heart rate is minimally elevated or normal, and there is no change in blood pressure, pulse pressure, or respiratory rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class II hemorrhage occurs when there is a 15 to 30 percent blood volume loss and is manifested clinically as tachycardia (heart rate of 100 to 120), tachypnea (respiratory rate of 20 to 24), and a decreased pulse pressure, although systolic blood pressure changes minimally if at all. The skin may be cool and clammy, and capillary refill may be delayed. An increasing maternal heart rate and tachypnea with stable systolic blood pressure should be regarded as evidence of compensated shock and should prompt investigation and institution of a PPH protocol, even if only light vaginal bleeding is observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class III hemorrhage involves a 30 to 40 percent blood volume loss, resulting in a significant drop in blood pressure and changes in mental status. Any hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg) or drop in blood pressure greater than 20 to 30 percent of the measurement at presentation is cause for concern. While diminished anxiety or pain may contribute to such a drop, the clinician must assume it is due to hemorrhage until proven otherwise. Heart rate (&ge;120 and &quot;thread&quot;) and respiratory rate are markedly elevated, while urine output is diminished. Capillary refill is delayed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class IV hemorrhage involves more than 40 percent blood volume loss leading to significant depression in blood pressure and mental status. Most patients in class IV shock are hypotensive (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg). Pulse pressure is narrowed (&le;25 mmHg), and tachycardia is marked (&gt;120). Urine output is minimal or absent. The skin is cold and pale, and capillary refill is delayed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H227427436\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis of mild hemodynamic instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although vasodilatation due to neuraxial anesthesia and vasovagal reactions may result in <span class=\"nowrap\">lightheadedness/syncope,</span> tachycardia, and hypotension, these entities are less likely postpartum than PPH, and they are readily reversible and generally not dangerous. Lightheadedness, tachycardia, or hypotension is unlikely to be due to neuraxial anesthesia if the woman was hemodynamically stable prior to delivery, the level of the block did not become significantly higher immediately following delivery, and symptoms did not abruptly follow systemic administration of a drug known to cause hypotension.

After a vaginal birth, treatment of atony begins with uterotonic drugs and minimally invasive procedures (eg, intrauterine balloon tamponade) and progresses to more invasive procedures (eg, uterine artery embolization) until hemorrhage is controlled.

The pituitary gland is enlarged in pregnancy and prone to infarction from hypovolemic shock. Damage to the pituitary can be mild or severe, and can affect the secretion of one, several, or all of its hormones. A common presentation is a combination of failure to lactate postdelivery and amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, but any of the manifestations of hypopituitarism (eg, hypotension, hyponatremia, hypothyroidism) can occur any time from the immediate postpartum period to years after delivery. If the patient remains hypotensive after control of hemorrhage and volume replacement, she should be evaluated and treated for adrenal insufficiency immediately; evaluation of other hormonal deficiencies can be deferred until four to six weeks postpartum. This evaluation is described in detail separately.

The diagnosis should be considered in patients with a tensely distended abdomen and progressive oliguria who are developing multiorgan failure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal compartment syndrome in adults&quot;</a>). Of note, the normal postpartum patient after cesarean delivery has been reported to have an intraabdominal pressure that approaches that seen in abdominal compartment syndrome in nonpregnant individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2741354859\"><span class=\"h2\">Asherman syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Development of intrauterine adhesions (termed Asherman syndrome) can lead to menstrual abnormalities and infertility. Approximately 90 percent of cases of severe intrauterine adhesive disease are related to uterine curettage for pregnancy complications, such as PPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Uterine compression sutures used to treat PPH have also been associated with the development of intrauterine adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>].

Postpartum anemia can also be defined as a hemoglobin level of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;11&nbsp;g/dL</span> at 1&nbsp;week postpartum and <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;12&nbsp;g/dL</span> at 8&nbsp;weeks postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Severe anemia due to PPH may require red cell transfusions, depending on the severity of anemia and the degree of symptomatology attributable to anemia. A common practice is to offer a transfusion to symptomatic women with a hemoglobin value &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Oral iron should lead to a modest reticulocytosis beginning in approximately seven days and a rise in the hemoglobin concentration of approximately 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> over the ensuing three weeks. Parenteral iron therapy is another option; advantages are that hemoglobin levels rise faster and less gastric upset occurs compared with oral therapy. Nevertheless, most women with mild to moderate anemia resolve the anemia sufficiently rapidly with oral iron and it is cheap and convenient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. A ferritin level at approximately six weeks postpartum helps to guide iron therapy. Treatment of iron deficiency anemia is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although erythropoietin can increase the rate of recovery to normal hemoglobin levels, it does not have an immediate effect and has not been proven to reduce transfusion requirements after PPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. It is no more effective than iron therapy in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], and it is expensive. However, for the few women with severe anemia who do not respond to iron therapy because of blunted erythropoiesis due to infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammation, some hematologists consider recombinant human erythropoietin an alternative to transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H512233917\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a prior PPH have as much as a 15 percent risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. The risk of recurrence depends, in part, on the underlying cause (eg, the risk of recurrent abruption is 5 to 15 percent).</p><p>PPH alone is not a strong indication for screening for inherited bleeding diatheses, given that undiagnosed bleeding disorders are rarely the cause of PPH. As an example, one study of 50 women with PPH who underwent postpartum screening identified a bleeding diathesis in only one woman [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. However, unexplained PPH that does not respond to general measures should alert clinicians to the possibility of a bleeding disorder as a causative factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], especially in women with a history of menorrhagia, excessive bleeding after minor trauma, or a family history of a bleeding disorder.

Specific interventions are available for managing risk in women with abnormal placentation or bleeding diatheses. For most patients, knowledge of risk factors for PPH is not useful clinically because only a small proportion of at-risk women develop PPH (abnormal placentation is an exception) and many women without risk factors experience PPH.

Traumatic, hemorrhaging lesions are managed surgically and coagulopathy is managed medically, with replacement of blood products. The treatment of atony depends on the route of delivery, as there is less concern about the morbidity of open operative interventions when the patient's abdomen is already open.
