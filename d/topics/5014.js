However, many will experience a recurrence and die of leukemia. Relapse is thought to result from residual leukemic cells that remain following the achievement of &quot;complete&quot; remission, but are below the limits of detection using conventional morphologic assessment. These subclinical levels of residual leukemia are termed &quot;minimal residual disease&quot; (MRD) or &quot;measureable residual disease&quot; and can be evaluated using more sensitive assays. The latter term emphasizes the limitations of available techniques for detecting fewer than one ALL blast in 10,000 normal cells. </p><p>MRD assays are routinely used in the clinical care of children with ALL and increasingly in adults as well. MRD measurements during and after induction therapy are highly prognostic and correlate with relapse rates. &#160; &#160;</p><p>This topic review will focus on the methods for MRD monitoring in ALL. The clinical significance of MRD detection in ALL and the use of MRD testing in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia are covered separately.

This approach is supported by several observations that illustrate the difficulty in ascertaining whether a patient with ALL in morphologic CR is likely to remain disease-free:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematogones &ndash; Hematogones are benign lymphoid precursors. Morphologic evaluation may be unable to distinguish between ALL blast cells, activated mature lymphocytes, and hematogones. This distinction is particularly difficult in samples of bone marrow recovering from chemotherapy or transplantation, where hematogones may account for 10 percent of the lymphoid cells. Most of the time, hematogones can be distinguished from leukemia cells by their immunophenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sampling error &ndash; A single bone marrow specimen represents only a very small percentage of the total bone marrow cellular population and thereby presents a potential for sampling error. Documented cases exist in which a bone marrow aspiration was normal at one site and showed leukemia at another. While this may occasionally be true early in the course of the disease, it is less of a problem after chemotherapy has been given (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Source of cells'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection limits &ndash; The detection of ALL blasts by morphologic review or conventional cytogenetics is limited by operator error and the number of metaphases evaluated. In one study, the median lower limit of detection of leukemic blasts by conventional microscopic examination of bone marrow by two experienced cytologists was greater than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The sensitivity of cytogenetics for detecting residual disease is limited to approximately 5 percent when only 20 to 40 metaphase cells are examined.</p><p/><p>Accordingly, a patient in clinical remission can harbor as many as 10<sup>10</sup> leukemic cells, equivalent to a detection limit of about one malignant cell for every 20 to 100 normal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. On the other hand, more sensitive assays, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), may detect one leukemic cell diluted 10<sup>5</sup> times, or approximately one to five blasts per 100,000 nucleated cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General aspects of cytogenetic analysis in hematologic malignancies&quot;, section on 'Polymerase chain reaction'</a>.)</p><p>The problem of defining CR is best exemplified by a study in which residual leukemic cells were monitored by PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The risk of relapse of ALL for children with &lt;15 or &gt;15 blasts per 100,000 mononuclear cells after both induction therapy and consolidation therapy was 4 and 47 percent, respectively. These calculations indicate that routine microscopic and cytogenetic determination of CR (ie, one blast in 20 normal cells) allows for a residual blast count up to 300 times greater than the number capable of causing leukemic relapse (ie, &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">blasts/100,000</span> cells). This observation suggests that &quot;true&quot; remission must be determined by means at least as sensitive as PCR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70804 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCE OF CELLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRD analyses can be performed on bone marrow aspirate specimens or peripheral blood. Bone marrow is preferred, especially in cases of B-lineage ALL. The amount of tissue needed differs according to the tissue source and testing used, and clinicians should contact the referral laboratory for details. A 2 to 5 mL sample from the first bone marrow aspirate usually provides sufficient numbers of bone marrow cells to achieve adequate sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Larger samples and those from subsequent aspirates at the same spot may result in erroneously low MRD measurement due to dilution by peripheral blood. MRD analyses can usually be performed using an aspirate from a single bone marrow site since ALL cells appear to be homogeneously distributed over the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>For T-lineage ALL, peripheral blood and bone marrow may yield similar MRD assessments. Peripheral blood is not a sensitive measure of MRD in B-lineage ALL. In studies using paired blood and bone marrow samples, MRD levels were higher in the bone marrow and the difference between bone marrow and blood MRD levels was greater for B-lineage ALL than for T-lineage ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T-lineage ALL &ndash; Blood MRD levels were comparable to or up to 1 log lower than bone marrow MRD levels. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B-lineage ALL &ndash; Blood MRD levels were 1 to 3 logs lower than bone marrow MRD levels. &#160; </p><p/><p>As an example, flow cytometry was used to measure MRD in paired samples of bone marrow and peripheral blood collected from 226 children at several time points during treatment for newly diagnosed ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. MRD was detected in marrow and blood in 72 pairs, and in marrow but not in blood in 67 pairs; it was undetectable in the remaining 579 pairs. Findings in marrow and blood were completely concordant in the 150 paired samples from patients with T-lineage ALL. In B-lineage ALL, only 37 of 104 positive marrow samples had a corresponding positive blood sample. The four-year cumulative incidence of relapse in B-lineage ALL was 80 percent for those who had peripheral blood MRD at the end of remission induction therapy but only 13 percent for those with MRD confined to the marrow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS FOR DETECTING MRD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of techniques have been studied for the detection of residual disease, including cytogenetics, cell culture systems, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), Southern blotting, multicolor flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and deep sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In order to apply these techniques for MRD detection, they must demonstrate three salient characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specificity &ndash; The ability to discriminate between malignant and normal cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitivity &ndash; The ability to detect one malignant cell in a background of at least 1000 normal cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reproducibility and applicability &ndash; The techniques must be standardized and reproducible, and results must be available in a timely manner</p><p/><p>PCR-based techniques, multicolor flow cytometry, and deep sequencing are able to fulfill the above criteria for detection of MRD for most patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70804 \">table 1</a>). In Europe, many centers use an approach to flow cytometry and PCR that has been standardized and validated allowing for more uniform assessment of MRD and of reporting results. While flow cytometry has been the technique most commonly used for pediatric ALL in the United States, there has been no standardization of this technique in most clinical laboratories in the United States. The percentage of patients eligible for monitoring using each technique depends upon the phenotype and genotype of the leukemia.</p><p>The preferred method depends at least in part upon the impact the results will have on patient care. When MRD analysis is used to identify patients at high risk of relapse with plans to escalate care, some clinicians will favor flow cytometry over PCR. While slightly less sensitive, results from flow cytometry are available more rapidly, and the likelihood of relapse following a positive result is high. In contrast, PCR is often preferred to identify patients with a low risk of relapse for whom a reduction in treatment intensity may be an option. With either method, the sample and technique used are critical for ensuring a reliable result. As an example, analysis of a small sample risks a false-negative interpretation.</p><p>The following studies have compared the sensitivity of different techniques:</p><p>A multicenter study compared the ability of real-time quantitative PCR and multicolor flow cytometry to predict bone marrow relapse using 726 surveillance samples from 228 children with ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Concordant results were obtained with these two techniques in 84 percent of day 29 samples using an MRD threshold of 0.1 percent. For patients with B-lineage ALL, PCR and flow cytometry were equally able to predict bone marrow relapse. For patients with T-lineage ALL, PCR was superior to flow cytometry in predicting bone marrow relapse. Neither method was able to predict isolated extramedullary relapse.</p><p>In another study, diagnostic and follow-up samples from 106 patients with ALL were evaluated with deep sequencing, multiparameter flow cytometry, and allele-specific oligonucleotide PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Sequencing detected MRD in all 28 samples shown to be positive by flow cytometry and in 35 of the 36 shown to be positive by PCR and revealed MRD in 10 and 3 additional samples that were negative by flow cytometry and PCR, respectively. These results suggest that deep sequencing is more sensitive than PCR and flow cytometry for detecting MRD. While deep sequencing is available commercially, the clinical utility of such assays has not yet been proven and prospective studies are needed to assess the correlation of MRD detected using this method with clinical outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27542615\"><span class=\"h2\">Real-time quantitative PCR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) can amplify a DNA or cDNA sequence unique to the leukemic clone resulting in the detection of one malignant cell among 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> normal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

These results suggest that deep sequencing is more sensitive than PCR and flow cytometry for detecting MRD.</p><p>While deep sequencing is available commercially, it needs to be studied prospectively to assess its correlation with clinical outcomes since the clinical utility of higher sensitivities has not yet been proven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTICOLOR FLOW CYTOMETRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multicolor flow cytometry uses a laser to determine specific immunophenotypic features of up to thousands of cells per second.

Classic flow cytometry techniques using four to six colors have limited sensitivity and specificity for MRD detection. Current flow cytometry techniques use six to eight colors to assess MRD with a sensitivity which is approximately 10<sup>-4</sup>, or about 0.5 to 1 log lower than that of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Investigational next-generation flow cytometry techniques using eight or more colors (eg, EuroFlow-based algorithms) have reported sensitivities of &lt;10<sup>-4</sup> to 10<sup>-5 </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Two examples illustrate the power of multicolor flow cytometry:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In B cell lineage ALL, leukemic blasts may co-express T cell antigens (eg, CD5 and CD7) or myeloid antigens (eg, CD13 and CD33), have asynchronous expression of antigens, or delete or overexpress a specific antigen (particularly CD10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

As such, a panel of representatives of the major European study groups on childhood and adult ALL has proposed the following definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/detection-of-minimal-residual-disease-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete MRD response &ndash; No MRD is detected with assessment that complies with a set of minimal technical requirements for the method used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRD persistence &ndash; Presence of a continuously quantifiable MRD positivity measurable at at least two time points with at least one relevant treatment element in between.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRD reappearance &ndash; Conversion from MRD negativity to quantifiable MRD positivity, ideally with confirmation from a second sample prior to a change in treatment.</p><p/><p>The terminology &quot;MRD negative&quot; cannot be applied simply because an MRD assessment does not identify residual disease below the level of detection of a given technique. As commonly used, the term &quot;MRD negative&quot; implies that a technique with adequate sensitivity (&le;10<sup>-4</sup>) has been used with proper technique on an adequate sample and that no residual disease was found. High certainty regarding the MRD assessment is necessary if the results will impact treatment decisions. The clinical use of MRD assessment in ALL is discussed in more detail separately.

These subclinical levels of residual leukemia cells are thought to be responsible for most of the relapses after initial disease response. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Difficulties in defining complete remission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRD assays are routinely used in the clinical care of children and increasingly in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MRD measurements during and after induction therapy are highly prognostic and correlate with relapse rates. However, not all patients who are MRD positive are destined to relapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-minimal-residual-disease-detection-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of minimal residual disease detection in acute lymphoblastic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRD analyses can be performed on bone marrow aspirate specimens or peripheral blood. Bone marrow is preferred, especially in cases of B cell lineage ALL. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Source of cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques and multicolor flow cytometry demonstrate sufficient sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and applicability for detection of MRD for most patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70804 \">table 1</a>). More robust techniques using multiplex PCR with deep sequencing and next-generation flow cytometry are under investigation. The percentage of patients eligible for monitoring using each technique depends upon the phenotype and genotype of the leukemia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Methods for detecting MRD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCR can measure residual leukemic cells by the identification of immunoglobulin or T cell receptor gene rearrangements or by leukemia-specific chromosomal rearrangements. PCR can quantify MRD in most cases of ALL. The sensitivity is typically higher than that of flow cytometry and the samples tested are stable, allowing for transport. The disadvantages of PCR include the dependence upon a sample obtained at the time of diagnosis, potential false-positives from sample contamination, and false-negatives due to the evolution of the leukemic clone. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) can be used to identify leukemia-specific fusion mRNA, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">BCR/ABL</span> resulting from t(9;22). RT-PCR is extraordinary sensitive and uses a leukemia-specific fusion mRNA target that is not specific to an individual and remains stable throughout the course of disease. However, RT-PCR is applicable to only a minority of patients with ALL, and the mRNA target is more easily degraded during sample <span class=\"nowrap\">handling/transport</span> than the DNA used for PCR. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Reverse transcriptase PCR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multicolor flow cytometry can identify MRD based upon the aberrant expression of antigens seen on immunophenotype. The sensitivity is still high, but lower than that of PCR. This technique can be applied to the majority of patients with ALL and can be completed quickly. Although not yet standardized, results are quantitative and provide additional information on the benign and malignant cells present in the sample. As with PCR, there is the potential for false-negative results due to a change in immunophenotypic expression. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Multicolor flow cytometry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep sequencing uses a high-throughput sequencing method to amplify antigen-receptor gene segments and identify multiple clonal gene rearrangements (ie, leukemia-specific sequences) at diagnosis. Unlike PCR and flow cytometry-based assays, deep sequencing allows for both the monitoring of MRD of original clones and of clonal evolution during therapy. While it appears to be more sensitive than both PCR and flow cytometry assays, deep sequencing results have not been prospectively analyzed to assess their correlation with clinical outcomes, and the clinical utility of higher sensitivity has not yet been proven. (See <a href=\"#H21984269\" class=\"local\">'Multiplex PCR with deep sequencing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standardized definitions for &quot;complete MRD response,&quot; &quot;MRD persistence,&quot; and &quot;MRD reappearance&quot; have been proposed. The terminology &quot;MRD negative&quot; cannot be applied simply because an MRD assessment does not identify residual disease below the level of detection of a given technique. The term &quot;MRD negative&quot; implies that a technique with adequate sensitivity (&le;10<sup>-4</sup>) has been used with proper technique on an adequate sample and that no residual disease was found. A low level of residual disease may persist in a patient whose bone marrow is found to be &quot;MRD negative.&quot; High certainty regarding the MRD assessment is necessary if the results will impact treatment decisions.
