The reasons for this change are unclear but could be explained by a general increase in the use of thromboprophylaxis in the postpartum period.

Data best illustrating this persistent (though attenuated) postpartum thrombotic risk are derived from a five year retrospective crossover-cohort analysis of an insurance claims database including almost 1.7 million women that examined rates of thrombosis during the first year following delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. VTE accounted for the majority (68 percent) of reported thrombotic events followed by stroke (28 percent) and myocardial infarction (4 percent). Compared to rates at one year, the risk of thrombosis was highest in the first six weeks postpartum (25 versus 2 per 100,000 deliveries; odds ratio [OR] 11, 95% CI 8-15) and declined to lower but still elevated rates at 7 to 12 weeks (6 versus 3 per 100,000 deliveries; OR 2, 95% CI 1.5-3.1). Rates were close to that of the general population by 13 to 18 weeks (3 versus 2 per 100,000 deliveries; OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.9-2.1). As compared with patients without postpartum thrombosis, those with thrombotic events were more likely to be older (&ge;35 years), have risk factors for thrombosis (eg, eclampsia, hypercoagulable state, smoking, cesarean section) and be white or black rather than Hispanic or Asian.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1321896\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic location of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of lower extremity DVTs during pregnancy are left-sided.

It includes other entities that present with erythema, warmth, swelling and tenderness of the lower extremity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flank, lower abdomen, buttock, or back. However, the clinical signs and symptoms of DVT in pregnancy are masked by many of the physiologic changes of normal pregnancy (eg, lower extremity swelling and cramping). </p><p>The clinical suspicion for DVT should be high in the setting of pregnancy. Although not always present, features that are highly suggestive of the diagnosis include unilateral signs and symptoms and the classic symptoms of iliac vein thrombosis <span class=\"nowrap\">(flank/pelvic/buttock</span> pain and swelling). Such symptoms should prompt immediate investigation for DVT with compressive or Doppler ultrasound. It is important to note that DVT can coexist with other conditions. Thus, although the finding of an alternative diagnosis (eg, cellulitis) will lower the clinical suspicion for DVT, it does not always obviate the need for diagnostic imaging. </p><p>The differential diagnosis of DVT in nonpregnant patients and the physiologic changes of pregnancy that can mimic DVT are discussed separately.

PE is the seventh leading cause of maternal mortality, responsible for 9 percent of maternal deaths. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy is a risk factor for the development of VTE with a reported incidence that is 4 to 50 times higher in pregnant women compared to nonpregnant women. Increased risk for lower extremity DVT is highest in the first six weeks of the postpartum period, with a higher than usual incidence of left-sided DVT and pelvic vein clot. (See <a href=\"#H1321882\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs and symptoms suggestive of proximal vein thrombosis are diffuse pain and swelling that may or may not be associated with erythema, warmth and tenderness of the lower extremity. Symptoms of iliac vein thrombosis include swelling of the entire leg with or without flank, lower abdomen, buttock, or back pain. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features of DVT in pregnancy overlap with many of the features of normal pregnancy. A high index of clinical suspicion and low threshold for the use of objective confirmatory testing are required to accurately diagnose DVT during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H1544043\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1318290\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic algorithm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D-dimer and clinical prediction rules are of limited value as pretest probability tools for the diagnosis of DVT during pregnancy and the puerperium. Moderate or highly sensitive D-dimer (with higher than usual cut-off values) have not been adequately validated for routine use in pregnancy. However, a negative D-dimer is associated with a high negative predictive value in any trimester.
