The following controversies were among those discussed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should the albuminuria threshold to define CKD continue to be 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (or equivalent)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should the GFR threshold to define CKD continue to be 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) threshold used to define CKD depend upon age?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Should patients diagnosed as having CKD be staged based upon albuminuria in addition to GFR? </p><p/><p>Conference attendees recommended, by at least a two-thirds majority vote, that the previous KDOQI and KDIGO definitions of CKD be retained, but that the classification be modified to include the cause of disease and albuminuria staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The rationale behind these decisions is discussed in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27258404\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND STAGING OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27258373\"><span class=\"h2\">Framework and conceptual model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with KDOQI and KDIGO that CKD is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by alterations in kidney structure and function, which manifest in various ways depending upon the underlying cause or causes and the severity of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77385 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Risk factors for CKD include genetic or sociodemographic predisposition, or the presence of diseases which can initiate and propagate kidney disease. Kidney failure is the end-stage of CKD and is defined as severely reduced kidney function or treatment with dialysis. The term &quot;end-stage renal disease&quot; (ESRD) generally refers to chronic kidney failure treated with either dialysis or transplantation. Acute kidney injury (AKI) may complicate CKD and hasten its progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Natural history of renal disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging criteria of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CKD is usually asymptomatic in its early stages. Symptoms appear in later stages in association with complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77385 \">figure 1</a>). In addition to commonly recognized hormonal and metabolic complications such as anemia and hyperparathyroidism, CKD complications include increased risks for systemic drug toxicity, cardiovascular disease, infection, cognitive impairment, and impaired physical function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Complications are more likely to occur at later stages, and may lead to death before kidney disease progresses to kidney failure. Complications may also arise from the adverse effects of interventions used to prevent or treat the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment of the complications of renal failure'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27258481\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of CKD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the KDOQI and KDIGO guidelines that CKD is defined by the presence of kidney damage <strong>or</strong> decreased kidney function <strong>for three or more months</strong>, irrespective of the cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80632\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80632 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The persistence of the damage or decreased function for at least three months is <strong>necessary</strong> to distinguish CKD from acute kidney disease. Kidney damage refers to pathologic abnormalities, whether established via renal biopsy or imaging studies, or inferred from markers such as urinary sediment abnormalities or increased rates of urinary albumin excretion. Decreased kidney function refers to a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is usually estimated (eGFR) using serum creatinine and one of several available equations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-newly-identified-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the patient with newly identified chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A discussion of the limitations of GFR estimation, including problems associated with using the serum creatinine in patients who are not in steady-state (such as hospitalized patients) and those with diminished creatinine generation, is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An important aspect of the definition is that the criteria are objective and can be ascertained by means of simple laboratory tests. Identifying patients with CKD can therefore be done without identification of the underlying cause and without consultation with a nephrologist. However, many patients should, under the circumstances outlined below, be referred to a nephrologist or other specialist with expertise in evaluating and managing patients with CKD in order to identify the cause of the CKD and to provide recommendations for therapies to reverse the kidney disease, slow progression, or treat complications. (See <a href=\"#H923217\" class=\"local\">'Referral to a specialist'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H114783633\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Referral to nephrologists'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27258566\"><span class=\"h3\">Kidney damage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney damage includes pathologic abnormalities in the native or transplanted kidney. Kidney damage is identified in most cases by the presence of one of the following clinical markers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80632\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80632 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Albuminuria &minus; In clinical practice, albuminuria is the most frequently assessed marker of kidney damage. Albuminuria reflects increased glomerular permeability to macromolecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Albuminuria may reflect primary kidney disease or kidney involvement in systemic disease. In particular, albuminuria may represent widespread endothelial dysfunction, such as can be seen with hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, obesity, and other disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although a number of different measurement methods have been used to assess and define albuminuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56286\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56286 \">table 2</a>), the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) in an untimed &quot;spot&quot; urine has many advantages (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-spot-urine-albumin-to-creatinine-ratio\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The generally accepted threshold for an abnormally elevated ACR is 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> (3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol)</span> or greater. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-urinary-protein-excretion-and-evaluation-of-isolated-non-nephrotic-proteinuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of urinary protein excretion and evaluation of isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We agree with the KDIGO recommendation that albuminuria above this threshold, regardless of cause, should be considered part of the definition of CKD. Individuals with a urine ACR &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> (or equivalent) have a significantly increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, ESRD, AKI and CKD progression compared with those who have a lower ACR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68921 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58089\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58089 \">figure 3</a>), even when eGFR is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/12,14-16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14-16,23</a>]. As an example, individuals with an ACR of 30 to 299 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> (3.4 to 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol)</span> or equivalent and an eGFR of 90 to 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> had an 11-fold higher relative risk for ESRD than those whose eGFR was similar but whose ACR was below 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the KDOQI and KDIGO definition, the threshold value for abnormally elevated urine ACR (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> or higher) is applied to adults of all ages, both men and women, and all racial-ethnic groups, despite differences in creatinine excretion rate by age, sex, and race. When this single threshold was applied to a population-based cohort in the United States, the prevalence of albuminuria was significantly greater in women compared with men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although urinary albumin concentrations were similar, women had lower urinary creatinine concentrations. Thus, sex-specific ACR thresholds that better predict a 24-hour urinary albumin excretion of 30 mg or higher (&ge;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> for women and &ge;17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> for men) have been used in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, we agree with the KDIGO recommendation to use a common albuminuria threshold for all adults due to the ease of widespread implementation. Albumin excretion rate in a timed urine collection can be used for confirmation when clinical circumstances require more accurate measurement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary sediment abnormalities &minus; Urinary sediment abnormalities such as red or white blood cell casts may indicate the presence of glomerular injury or tubular inflammation.

Measured GFR varies in normal individuals by age and sex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F73824\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73824 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], dietary protein intake, and possibly by race-ethnicity, although the magnitude of racial variations are not well known. Based upon a clearance measurements in healthy people and in people with kidney disease, the widely accepted threshold defining a decreased GFR is less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; kidney failure is defined as a GFR &lt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or treatment by dialysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80632\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80632 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>We agree with KDIGO that a measured GFR below this threshold should be considered part of the definition of CKD. GFR can be measured directly using the clearance of exogenous filtration markers such as inulin or iothalamate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, these measurement methods are complex to implement. Thus, in clinical practice, GFR is typically <strong>estimated</strong> (estimated GFR, or eGFR) from the serum concentration of creatinine, an endogenous filtration marker. The eGFR is now reported routinely by more than 75 percent of clinical laboratories in the US whenever the serum creatinine is measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Serum creatinine is measured frequently (about 280 million times per year in the US), and eGFR reporting has led to increased detection of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p>In routine practice, therefore, individuals who have an eGFR below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> are defined as having CKD. These individuals have a significantly increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, ESRD, AKI and CKD progression in compared with those whose eGFR is 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68921 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58089\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58089 \">figure 3</a>), even if the ACR is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/12,14-16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14-16,23</a>]. As an example, individuals with an eGFR of 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and a urine ACR less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> had a fivefold higher relative risk of ESRD compared than those with a similarly normal ACR but with an eGFR of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or greater. </p><p>However, as noted below, we do not generally recommend that patients who have an isolated decreased eGFR (eg, an eGFR of 45 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> without an elevation in albuminuria) be referred for care by a nephrologist or other specialist with expertise in caring for patients with kidney disease.

In a meta-analysis that included approximately 1.5 million individuals from multiple cohorts, for example, the associations between lower levels of eGFR with the incidence of death, cardiovascular disease, ESRD, and progression of kidney disease were similar among those older and younger than 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All-cause mortality &ndash; Compared with individuals who had an eGFR between 90 and 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and an ACR less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g,</span> the relative risks for all-cause mortality among those who had an eGFR between 45 and 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and an ACR less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> (ie, those with an &quot;isolated&quot; reduction in eGFR) were 1.9 (95% CI, 1.4-2.5) in those younger than 65 years and 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0-1.5) in those older than 65 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular mortality &ndash; Compared with individuals who had an eGFR between 90 and 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and an ACR less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g,</span> the relative risks for cardiovascular mortality among those who had an eGFR between 45 and 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and an ACR less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> (ie, those with an &quot;isolated&quot; reduction in eGFR) were 1.3 (95% CI, 0.6-3.2) in those younger than 65 years and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.2-1.8) in those older than 65 years.

A more detailed meta-analysis confirmed that the relative risks for all-cause mortality associated with a given eGFR were smaller among older individuals; however, the absolute risks associated with a given eGFR were higher among older individuals due to the elevated baseline risk for mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>There are limited data evaluating the association of isolated reductions in GFR with death and ESRD in the very elderly (ie, age 75 years and older).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation is the most frequently used GFR estimating equation in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation is more accurate than the MDRD Study equation, especially at a GFR &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and is replacing the MDRD Study equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. Both equations use age, sex, and race in addition to serum creatinine, and assign race as either black (eg, African American) versus non-black.

An isolated decreased eGFR in an otherwise healthy individual is more likely to be a false positive than in individuals with other markers of kidney damage or who have known risk factors for kidney disease. Confirmation of decreased eGFR by measurement of GFR (clearance of creatinine or exogenous filtration markers) is warranted when decisions depend upon more accurate knowledge of GFR, such as determining eligibility for kidney donation or adjusting the dose of toxic drugs that are excreted by the kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Albuminuria staging has been added because of the graded increase in risk for mortality, progression of CKD, and ESRD at higher levels of albuminuria, independent of eGFR, without an apparent threshold value (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68921 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58089\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58089 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/12,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,23</a>].

As an example, a patient with a GFR of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> likely has more severe kidney disease, and may be at higher risk for complications, than someone with a GFR of 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, even though both patients have GFR stage G4.</p><p>Patients with already diagnosed CKD can now be staged according to the cause of kidney disease and then into 18 separate categories with differing degrees of risk for progression to all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), CKD progression, and acute kidney injury. The relative risk for each outcome is higher with more severe GFR and ACR stages. Based upon these findings, a &quot;heat map&quot; can be constructed that divides patients with CKD into the following three broad risk categories based upon the likelihood of developing future kidney and cardiovascular complications (eg, ESRD, cardiovascular death) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59716 \">figure 5</a>); the proportion of the population in the United States with CKD (ascertained by eGFR and albuminuria) that falls into these risk categories is also given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate risk (yellow) &ndash; 73 percent of patients with CKD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk (orange) &ndash; 18 percent of patients with CKD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very high risk (red) &ndash; 9 percent of patients with CKD</p><p/><p>These three broad risk categories may help clinicians decide whether or not to refer their patients to a nephrologist or specialist with expertise in caring for patients with CKD, and to develop a clinical action plan.

If a patient with CKD is staged initially as low risk, this does <strong>not</strong> mean the he or she will remain low risk and not progress over the next several decades. As an example, a patient with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) who is diagnosed by imaging at a young age and who has a normal eGFR and no proteinuria may be low risk for developing ESRD in the short term, but has a high long-term risk of progressive CKD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, the heat map applies to patients who have been diagnosed with CKD.

It is possible that the association between advancing age and lower eGFR and higher albuminuria may be due to vascular disease rather than a natural aging process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. The fact that lower eGFR values are associated with increased kidney and cardiovascular disease rates in older as well as younger individuals is not consistent with the interpretation that decreased eGFR with aging is &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;physiological.&quot; Rather, it suggests that decreased eGFR in older adults is evidence of disease.

More accurate risk prediction for an individual patient can be accomplished by the development of risk-prediction instruments. In addition to eGFR and albuminuria, the cause of kidney disease, as well as other factors (eg, age, sex, race, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and others), should be considered in estimating prognosis. As an example, an instrument for predicting risk of progression of CKD to ESRD that used age, sex, eGFR, and albuminuria was developed from a large cohort of patients referred to nephrologists and has been extensively validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].

As a result, there are numerous recommendations that propose indications for referral to nephrologists, and none have been universally adopted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/71-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-75</a>]. However, one indication that is common to most guidelines is that all patients with severely decreased GFR (estimated GFR [eGFR] less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, GFR stage 4) should be referred for co-management with a nephrologist. Patients at or below this level of eGFR have already demonstrated that they have progressive kidney disease, and therefore are at high risk for progression to ESRD. In such patients, late referral to a nephrologist (ie, less than three months before the start of dialysis therapy) is associated with higher mortality after the initiation of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. </p><p>Patients with severely decreased eGFR require preparation for the possible onset of ESRD. Preparation involves a discussion regarding kidney replacement therapy (dialysis and transplantation), and conservative therapy for those not willing or unable to undergo kidney replacement therapy. In patients electing replacement therapy, timely creation of vascular access for hemodialysis, home dialysis training, and donor evaluation for preemptive transplantation should occur.

The term &quot;end-stage renal disease&quot; (ESRD) generally refers to CKD treated with either dialysis or transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H27258373\" class=\"local\">'Framework and conceptual model'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CKD is usually asymptomatic in its early stages. Symptoms appear in later stages in association with complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77385 \">figure 1</a>). In addition to commonly recognized hormonal and metabolic complications such as anemia and hyperparathyroidism, CKD complications include increased risks for systemic drug toxicity, cardiovascular disease, infection, cognitive impairment, and impaired physical function. (See <a href=\"#H27258373\" class=\"local\">'Framework and conceptual model'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CKD is defined by the presence of kidney damage <strong>or</strong> decreased kidney function <strong>for three or more months</strong>, irrespective of the cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80632\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80632 \">table 1</a>). The persistence of the damage or decreased function for at least three months is <strong>necessary</strong> to distinguish CKD from acute kidney disease. Kidney damage refers to pathologic abnormalities, whether established via renal biopsy or imaging studies or inferred from markers such as urinary sediment abnormalities or increased rates of urinary albumin excretion. Decreased kidney function refers to a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is usually estimated (eGFR) using serum creatinine and one of several available equations. (See <a href=\"#H27258481\" class=\"local\">'Definition of CKD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Kidney damage is identified in most cases by the presence of albuminuria, urinary sediment abnormalities, anatomic abnormalities discovered with imaging studies, pathologic abnormalities discovered with kidney biopsy, or a history of kidney transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80632\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80632 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H27258566\" class=\"local\">'Kidney damage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased kidney function is identified in most cases by an eGFR less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80632\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80632 \">table 1</a>). Estimation of GFR is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Risk stratification is used as a guide to inform appropriate treatments and the intensity of monitoring and patient education. In patients who are diagnosed with CKD using the criteria described above, staging of the CKD is done according to (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70597 \">table 3</a>) (see <a href=\"#H27258970\" class=\"local\">'Staging of CKD'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cause of disease &ndash; Identifying the cause of kidney disease (eg, diabetes, drug toxicity, auto-immune diseases, urinary tract obstruction, kidney transplantation, etc.) enables specific therapy directed at preventing further injury and has implications for the rate of progression and the risk of complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55646 \">table 4</a>).

Since the original KDOQI classification was published, stage 3 CKD (a GFR of 30 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) has been subdivided into GFR stages 3a and 3b to more accurately reflect the continuous association between lower GFR and risk for mortality and adverse kidney outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H27259120\" class=\"local\">'GFR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Three categories of albuminuria (A stages) &ndash; The three albuminuria stages follow familiar definitions of normal, moderately increased (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;), and severely increased (formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot; and nephrotic range) albuminuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70597 \">table 3</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-spot-urine-albumin-to-creatinine-ratio\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). Albuminuria staging has been added because of the graded increase in risk for mortality, progression of CKD, and ESRD at higher levels of albuminuria, independent of eGFR.
