This usage is not accurate. Most febrile illnesses either resolve before a diagnosis can be made or develop distinguishing characteristics that lead to a diagnosis. FUO refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an established etiology despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic testing.</p><p>Large case series of FUO applying this definition have been collected over a number of decades; these facilitate an approach to patients with FUO and an understanding of the changing patterns of FUO with time and newer diagnostic techniques.</p><p>The common and uncommon entities causing FUO in adults will be reviewed here. The definitions of this condition, an approach to the adult with FUO, and the etiology of FUO in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with fever of unknown origin&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-of-unknown-origin-in-children-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever of unknown origin in children: Etiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Three general categories of illness account for the majority of &quot;classic&quot; FUO cases and have been consistent through the decades:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Connective tissue diseases (eg, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyalgia rheumatica)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancies</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most prevalent causes of fever of unknown origin (FUO) are infection, noninfectious inflammatory diseases, and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/1-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-9</a>]. Infections and malignancies as causes of FUOs have decreased over time, while inflammatory diseases and undiagnosed fevers have increased (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54701%7EID%2F66395\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54701 graphicRef66395 \">table 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73878\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73878 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Infections and noninfectious inflammatory diseases each account for 15 to 25 percent of FUOs, while malignancies cause less than 20 percent of these fevers. The rate of no diagnosis in studies published since 1990 has varied widely from 9 to 51 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/3-8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8,11</a>]. The prevalence of various febrile conditions also reflects geography, subpopulations under study, host and microbial factors, and hospital and health services.</p><p>In one of the latest published series, 73 patients from the Netherlands seen between December 2003 and July 2005 were evaluated for FUO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with fever of unknown origin&quot;, section on 'Outcome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among infections, tuberculosis and abscesses are the most common etiologies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberculosis (TB) is the single most common infection in most FUO series. Presentations of TB, which escape early detection, are either extrapulmonary, miliary, or occur in the lungs of patients with significant preexisting pulmonary disease or immunodeficiency. As an example, pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with AIDS is often subtle, and the chest radiograph is normal in 15 to 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Disseminated (miliary) TB is readily treatable, while death can occur in patients who remain untreated. Thus, a vigorous search for this disorder should be pursued.</p><p>The purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test is positive in fewer than 50 percent of patients with TB who present with an FUO, usually due to cutaneous anergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The interferon-gamma release assay also has low sensitivity for the diagnosis of active TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Sputum samples are positive in only one-quarter of cases. Because of these difficulties, establishing the diagnosis often requires biopsy of affected nodes, bone marrow, or liver.</p><p>Techniques for isolation of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> from blood include isolator cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on BACTEC blood culture bottles with evidence of early growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Both of these methods have yielded positive results in approximately 16 days, although PCR may be more sensitive and specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occult abscesses are usually located in the abdomen or pelvis. Underlying conditions, which predispose to abscess formation, include cirrhosis, steroid or immunosuppressive medications, recent surgery, and diabetes. Abscesses arise when there has been disruption of a barrier such as the bowel wall in appendicitis, diverticulitis, or inflammatory bowel disease. The rupture often seals off spontaneously and local peritonitis is converted to an abscess by host defense mechanisms. Intraabdominal abscesses can develop in subphrenic, omental, pouch of Douglas, pelvic, and retroperitoneal locations in addition to visceral sites.</p><p>The source of infection in these abscesses can vary with the site of abscess formation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pyogenic liver abscesses usually follow biliary tract disease or abdominal suppuration such as appendicitis or diverticulitis. Amebic liver abscesses cannot be distinguished on clinical grounds from pyogenic abscesses; amebic serology is positive in more than 95 percent of cases of extraintestinal disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematogenous seeding rather than contiguous spread accounts for the majority of splenic abscesses, which are often missed prior to autopsy; endocarditis is the most common infection currently associated with splenic abscess.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perinephric or renal abscesses usually arise from existing infection in the urinary tract, although urine cultures may be negative or only intermittently positive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-and-perinephric-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal and perinephric abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteomyelitis should be considered as a cause of FUO since localized symptoms in some sites may not be prominent. Examples include vertebral osteomyelitis and osteomyelitis of the mandible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-osteomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of osteomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacterial endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cultures are negative in 2 to 5 percent of patients with infective endocarditis even when the utmost care is taken in obtaining the proper number and volume of blood cultures. The frequency of negative cultures is higher in patients who have already been treated with antimicrobials, such as intravenous drug users who frequently self-administer antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Culture negativity is particularly likely with the following organisms, which are more difficult to isolate in culture:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Coxiella burnetii</em> (Q fever) and <em>Tropheryma whipplei</em> occasionally cause endocarditis but will not grow using cell free media. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=q-fever-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Q fever endocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=whipples-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Whipple's disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Brucella</em>, <em>Mycoplasma</em>, <em>Chlamydia</em>, <em>Histoplasma</em>, <em>Legionella</em>, and <em>Bartonella </em>will not grow unless special media or microbiologic methods are employed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Haemophilus</em> spp, <em>Actinobacillus</em>, <em>Cardiobacterium</em>, <em>Eikenella</em>, and <em>Kingella</em> (the so-called HACEK group) will not be detected unless blood cultures are incubated for 7 to 21 days.</p><p/><p>The microbiology laboratory should be notified when endocarditis or other infections with such organisms are suspected, since most laboratories routinely discard blood cultures when there has been no growth after seven days of incubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Non&ndash;culture-based diagnostic modalities can be used to increase the diagnostic yield when culture-negative endocarditis is suspected (eg, serologic assays or polymerase chain reaction). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=culture-negative-endocarditis-epidemiology-microbiology-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Culture-negative endocarditis: Epidemiology, microbiology, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Peripheral manifestations are rarely detected in subacute endocarditis presenting as FUO. Endocarditis in intravenous drug users is often right sided and lacks murmurs, and self-administration of antimicrobials may obscure the detection of bacteremia.</p><p>Transesophageal echocardiography is positive in over 90 percent of cases of infective endocarditis presenting as FUO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. False-positive results may be due to anatomic abnormalities or noninfective vegetations; false-negative results occur with small vegetations or those that have already embolized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, other endovascular infections (eg, mycotic aneurysms, septic thrombophlebitis) can be occult causes of fever.

The manifestations of GCA, however, can vary and may be transient. Jaw claudication, if present, is helpful in suspecting the diagnosis of GCA. Temporal artery biopsy is suggested in all cases of suspected GCA.

Fever is most often evident in advanced lymphomas or in those with aggressive histologic patterns. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and bone marrow biopsy usually identifies the sites of involvement.</p><p>Myelodysplastic syndromes occasionally present with fever and subtle evidence on blood smear of maturation arrest or dysplastic changes in one or several of the blood cell lines. Aleukemic leukemias are usually of the myeloid line. The diagnosis is made by bone marrow biopsy. Multiple myeloma has also been reported as a cause of FUO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Renal cell carcinoma presents with fever in approximately 20 percent of cases. Microscopic hematuria and erythrocytosis may occur, but frequently there are no urine sediment abnormalities and the hematocrit is normal. Other adenocarcinomas also can cause fever, often but not invariably in the presence of hepatic metastases.</p><p>Atrial myxomas are uncommon but present with fever in approximately one-third of cases. Other findings include arthralgias, emboli, and hypergammaglobulinemia. The diagnosis is usually established by echocardiography.

Eosinophilia and rash accompany drug fever in only 25 percent of cases; thus, the absence of these findings should not preclude a search for a possible offending drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

However, it is not uncommon for several weeks or, in some cases, months to years to elapse prior to the start of fever.</p><p>The diagnosis of drug fever is made by a therapeutic trial of stopping the suspected drug (with occasional rechallenge). Most patients will defervesce within 72 hours after substituting drugs, although some may not recover for weeks. Clearance of offending drug derivatives may be delayed if the derivatives become bound or haptenated on long-lived host proteins.

Patients with factitious fever feign illness for some secondary gain. They may also display evidence of self-mutilation and may have had multiple hospitalizations, invasive diagnostic tests (eg, cardiac catheterization), and surgery. The response to psychiatric intervention has been discouraging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factitious-disorder-imposed-on-self-munchausen-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factitious disorder imposed on self (Munchausen syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fever elevations may be fabricated through manipulation of thermometers. Manipulated temperature elevations can be extreme, sometimes exceeding 41&ordm;C, and the fever cycles may not be accompanied by the expected patient behavior and physical signs such as chills, covering with blankets, cool extremities, sweats, warm extremities, and tachycardia. Current widespread use of electronic thermometers diminishes the opportunity to manipulate or exchange thermometers.</p><p>Fever also can be induced by taking medications to which patients are allergic (eg, phenolphthalein) or by injecting foreign matter parenterally (eg, milk, urine, culture material, feces). The resulting illness may be associated with polymicrobial bacteremia, episodes of bacteremia caused by different pathogens, or recurrent soft tissue infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Disordered heat homeostasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disordered heat homeostasis occasionally follows hypothalamic dysfunction (eg, following a massive stroke or anoxic brain injury) or abnormal heat dissipation (from skin conditions such as ichthyosis). Excess heat production may also occur from illnesses such as hyperthyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Dental abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apical dental abscesses are a rare cause of persistent fever that can be overlooked by the patient and physician. Among the 20 case reports in the literature, most individuals defervesced following removal of the decayed teeth, with or without antimicrobial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Other conditions linked to oral disease include brain abscesses, meningitis, mediastinal abscesses, and endocarditis; these are more common than dental FUO.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6183959\"><span class=\"h2\">Concurrent infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The common occurrence of multiple concurrent opportunistic infections in FUO patients with AIDS confounds diagnosticians, particularly when CD4 counts are very low. These may include cytomegalovirus, <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex, <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em>, endemic fungi (eg, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>), and gastrointestinal protozoa (eg, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, <em>Microsporidium</em>).</p><p>Other types of immunocompromised hosts may also present with FUO caused by more than one infection.

Organisms that cause babesiosis, Lyme disease, and <span class=\"nowrap\">anaplasmosis/ehrlichiosis,</span> which have varying incubation periods and different susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents, may infect an individual concurrently or serially and present as FUOs or relapsing fever syndromes.

Fever is typically modest (&lt;38.3&ordm;C). There are several characteristic laboratory abnormalities in alcoholic hepatitis. The most typical is serum aminotransferase elevations to less than 500 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> with a disproportionate elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) compared with alanine aminotransferase (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase); the ratio is usually greater than 2.0, a value that is rarely seen in other forms of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].
