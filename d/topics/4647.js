Croup is common in children between 6 months and 3 years of age. It causes a cough that sounds like a seal barking. In most children, croup goes away on its own. But some children with croup need to be seen by a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H474861981\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of croup?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Croup usually begins like a regular cold.
