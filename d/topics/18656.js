The true incidence of these infections is difficult to determine because many cases are unreported, the diagnosis may not be considered, or a specific viral etiology is never confirmed. However, these disorders occur with sufficient frequency that clinicians should be familiar with the clinical manifestations, diagnostic techniques, and therapeutic options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the major distinguishing features between aseptic meningitis and viral encephalitis, as well as the viral etiologies that can cause encephalitis. Topic reviews that discuss the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and pathogens associated with aseptic meningitis in adults and viral encephalitis in children are found elsewhere.

Patients with meningitis may be uncomfortable, lethargic, or distracted by headache, but their cerebral function remains normal. In encephalitis, however, abnormalities in brain function are a differentiating feature, including altered mental status, motor or sensory deficits, altered behavior and personality changes, and speech or movement disorders. Seizures and postictal states can be seen with meningitis alone and should not be construed as definitive evidence of encephalitis. Other neurologic manifestations of encephalitis may include hemiparesis, flaccid paralysis, and paresthesias.</p><p>However, the distinction between the two entities can be frequently blurred since some patients may have both a parenchymal and meningeal process with clinical features of both. The patient is usually labeled as having meningitis or encephalitis based upon which features predominate in the illness although meningoencephalitis is also a common term that recognizes the overlap. The importance of distinguishing between encephalitis and aseptic meningitis relates to the fact that the likely cause of each syndrome is different. Some viral agents are more likely to cause aseptic meningitis, and others are more likely to cause encephalitis (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aseptic-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aseptic meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">VIRAL VERSUS POSTINFECTIOUS ENCEPHALITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral encephalitis can be either primary or postinfectious (ie, it occurs after the infection has resolved) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary infection is characterized by viral invasion of the central nervous system. Neuronal involvement can be identified on histologic examination, which may show inclusion bodies on light microscopy or viral particles on electron microscopy. The virus can often be cultured from brain tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In postinfectious encephalitis (also called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, or ADEM), a virus cannot be detected or recovered, and the neurons are spared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, perivascular inflammation and demyelination are prominent in this entity. The inability to recover a virus and the type of histologic abnormalities observed suggest that postinfectious encephalitis is an immune-mediated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Despite the differences in pathogenesis and histologic findings, the clinical significance of viral versus postinfectious encephalitis is often limited. It is also important to note that a number of viral infections, such as measles, varicella, or rubella, can produce either syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Viral pathogens'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">VIRAL PATHOGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide variety of different viruses can infect the central nervous system. Most viruses are capable of causing either meningitis or encephalitis, although, in general, a given virus is more likely to cause one syndrome rather than the other. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Meningitis versus encephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p>A common cause of sporadic encephalitis is herpes simplex virus type 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is important to diagnose this virus because it is treatable and the success of treatment is related to how early therapy is initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other viral pathogens may be suggested by geographic location (eg, St. Louis encephalitis in North America and Japanese encephalitis in Asia) and epidemiologic clues, such as exposure history (eg, bat exposure or dog bite and rabies), regional outbreaks (eg, enterovirus type 71 in Denver, Colorado) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and clinical clues, such as profound weakness and rash with West Nile. Uncommon causes include varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV, human herpes virus-6, and Zika virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].

In the absence of these findings, epidemiologic information such as seasonal occurrence or exposures may be helpful in establishing a specific diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57784\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57784 \">table 1</a>). Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arboviruses (eastern equine, western equine, St. Louis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Zika, and West Nile virus) cause disease when mosquitoes are active, whereas herpes simplex virus can occur at any time. In contrast, walking in woods or marshy areas with high tick populations might suggest tick-borne encephalitides seen in Eastern Europe, Colorado tick fever (western United States), Powassan virus (transmitted by <em>Ixodes</em> ticks in eastern Canada and the north central and northeastern United States), or nonviral etiologies, such as Lyme disease or Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

West Nile virus first appeared in the United States in 1999, even though it had already been established in Africa, Asia, and Europe, and then spread rapidly across the country. The incidence of other arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) varies significantly based upon geographic region. As an example, St. Louis encephalitis virus infection occurs in North America, predominantly throughout the Midwest and South in the United States. In patients with the appropriate travel history, nonviral mosquito-borne illnesses, such as cerebral malaria, may be a consideration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of West Nile virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=st-louis-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;St. Louis encephalitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of malaria in nonpregnant adults and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both geography and animal exposure can broaden the diagnostic considerations of etiologic agents. Nipah virus encephalitis, which appeared in Malaysia and Singapore and is now present in Bangladesh, may be associated with exposure to pigs or bats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Avian influenza infection was associated with encephalitis in two patients from Vietnam; the source of exposure was unclear but both children swam in a canal that was frequented by ducks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a human-acquired zoonosis caused by a rodent-borne arenavirus, which can be transmitted through exposure to secretions of mice, rats, and hamsters. Encephalitis resulting from a bornavirus was reported in three German breeders of variegated squirrels; the virus was also detected in a squirrel from the breeding population of one of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Symptoms and signs of meningeal irritation (photophobia and nuchal rigidity) are usually absent with a pure encephalitis, but often accompany a meningoencephalitis. Seizures are common with encephalitis, and focal neurologic abnormalities can occur, including hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, and exaggerated deep tendon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pathologic reflexes. Patients may appear confused, agitated, or obtunded.</p><p>The clinical presentation of aseptic meningitis is generally nonspecific, with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting, occasionally accompanied by photophobia and a stiff neck. Physical examination characteristically reveals signs of nuchal rigidity, but its absence does not rule out the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aseptic-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aseptic meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clues on physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are usually no pathognomonic findings on the initial patient encounter, certain physical examination features may suggest a particular diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parotitis strongly suggests the diagnosis of mumps encephalitis in an unvaccinated patient with mental status changes.

In fact, it has been misdiagnosed as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome. A maculopapular rash is also seen in approximately half of patients with this infection and is not expected in other viral encephalitides.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tremors of the eyelids, tongue, lips, and extremities may suggest the possibility of St. Louis encephalitis or West Nile encephalitis in the appropriate geographic location or travel history.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings of hydrophobia, aerophobia, pharyngeal spasms, and hyperactivity suggest encephalitic rabies. Atypical presentations of rabies include seizures, cranial nerve palsies, and myoclonus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grouped vesicles in a dermatomal pattern may suggest varicella zoster virus (VZV), which can occasionally cause encephalitis; however, the absence of rash does not eliminate VZV from consideration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

CT scanning is useful to rule out space-occupying lesions. MRI is sensitive for detecting demyelination, which may be seen in other clinical states presenting with mental status changes (eg, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). If present, the location of abnormal signal can sometimes be suggestive of specific etiologies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporal lobe involvement is strongly suggestive of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, although other herpes viruses (eg, VZV, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 6) can also produce this clinical picture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of the thalamus or basal ganglia may be observed in the setting of encephalitis due to respiratory viral infection, Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, arbovirus, and tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 17 patients with confirmed West Nile infection, MRI imaging demonstrated a variety of abnormalities in the basal ganglia, thalami, mesial temporal structures, brainstem, and cerebellum in eight patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Three patients with muscle weakness also had abnormalities noted in the spinal cord and cauda equina.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of hydrocephalus may suggest nonviral etiologies such as bacteria, fungal, or parasitic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI during postinfectious encephalitis may demonstrate multifocal lesions mainly involving supratentorial white matter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The findings with aseptic meningitis and meningoencephalitis are generally indistinguishable (although, rarely, there may be few, if any, CSF abnormalities with a pure encephalitis).</p><p>The following findings are characteristic of viral CNS infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76324 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased white blood cell (WBC) count, but usually less than <span class=\"nowrap\">250/mm<sup>3</sup></span>. The differential shows a predominance of lymphocytes, although early infection may reveal a predominance of neutrophils. In the latter setting, a repeat CSF cell count eight hours later will generally show a shift from neutrophils to lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated protein concentration, but usually less than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Usually normal glucose concentration (&gt;50 percent of blood value), but moderately reduced values are occasionally seen with HSV, mumps, or some enteroviruses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red cells are usually absent (in a nontraumatic tap); their presence in the appropriate clinical setting suggests HSV-1 infection or other necrotizing encephalitides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>These findings are generally quite different from those associated with bacterial meningitis, which include a higher WBC count in the CSF <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;2000/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> with neutrophil predominance, a higher protein concentration (&gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> and usually hypoglycorrhachia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76324 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>However, exclusion of bacterial meningitis based only upon individual CSF parameters can be difficult, since the spectrum of CSF values in bacterial meningitis is so wide that the absence of one or more of these findings is of little value (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76324 \">table 2</a>). This was illustrated in a review of 296 episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis; 50 percent had a CSF glucose above 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> 44 percent had a CSF protein below 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and 13 percent had a CSF white cell count below <span class=\"nowrap\">100/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

A confirmed or probable etiologic agent was identified for only 16 percent of cases. Although the vast majority of patients did not have an established diagnosis, those presenting with diffuse cerebral edema or intractable seizures had a poor neurologic recovery and increased risk of mortality. In contrast, those with self-limited seizure activity had a rapid recovery. These data suggest that future studies, which group disorders by clinical profile, may help better estimate prognosis, even if the etiologic agent is unknown.</p><p>Even with prompt initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> therapy, HSV encephalitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. An analysis of 236 patients with confirmed HSV-1 encephalitis in Sweden has demonstrated a one-year mortality of 14 percent, with epilepsy and neuropsychiatric sequelae occurring in 24 percent and 22 percent of surviving patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is required as an initial diagnostic step in patients with suspected viral encephalitis. The opening CSF pressure should be noted and CSF should be analyzed for cell count, glucose, and protein. In addition to this basic testing, the initial work-up for the etiology of a viral infection should generally include: CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) -1, HSV-2, and enteroviruses. Additional testing (eg, serology for the arboviruses, HIV testing) should be considered based on the clinical presentation and exposure history (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Historical clues'</a> above). As noted below, diagnostic evaluation for nonviral infectious (eg, bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria) and noninfectious etiologies should also be considered. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The most important viral etiology to rule out in a patient with encephalitis is HSV, since this clinical entity is usually fatal if untreated. HSV should be considered, particularly if there is temporal lobe focality suggested by symptoms, signs, or imaging studies. Diagnosis is most readily made by detecting HSV DNA by PCR on CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. While awaiting confirmation, empiric therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> should be initiated. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Enteroviruses are more commonly associated with viral meningitis, but infrequently they may cause encephalitis as well. PCR testing on the CSF sample is the diagnostic test of choice. The pathogen can also be cultured from the stool and throat; however, a positive stool or throat culture is not necessarily diagnostic of disease, especially in summer months.</p><p>In summary, the battery of initial diagnostic tests often includes CSF culture, PCR, and serology for the suspected pathogens. Further testing may also be required if the patient is not improving. However, even with use of PCR testing, the etiology in many cases remains undefined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Definitive diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral culture has been routinely ordered by most clinicians after obtaining CSF samples. However, one review demonstrated that viruses were recovered from only 6 percent of 22,394 viral cultures of CSF samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Furthermore, in a subset analysis by suspected etiology, 1290 CSF samples were evaluated for HSV by PCR and culture. Of these, only nine samples were positive for HSV and all were identified only by PCR testing.</p><p>In most circumstances, PCR testing has replaced viral culture in the work-up of the CSF. Culture may still be important when rare causes of encephalitis are being considered (eg, influenza, parainfluenza, measles, mumps) for which PCR testing is unavailable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the advent of PCR technology, significant advances have been made in the ability to diagnose viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. CSF PCR should be performed for HSV-1, HSV-2, and enteroviruses. Identification of HSV-1 in the CSF is a rapid, sensitive, and specific diagnostic test for HSV-1 encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Likewise, identification of HSV-2 in CSF is a rapid diagnostic test for HSV-2 meningitis. PCR testing can also be requested for varicella zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus in the appropriate settings. PCR testing for other viruses will depend on the clinical situation, epidemiology, and availability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pcr-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-herpes-simplex-virus-in-patients-with-encephalitis-or-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;PCR testing for the diagnosis of herpes simplex virus in patients with encephalitis or meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic testing is most important for patients who are not improving and who do not have a diagnosis based upon CSF analysis, culture, and PCR. Most viral etiologies require paired sera for diagnosis; thus it is prudent to save serum in the setting of acute illness that can later be used if necessary. Convalescent serology should be obtained no sooner than three weeks after the onset of the clinical illness. As an example, the presence of IgM antibodies in a single serum provides presumptive evidence of St. Louis encephalitis; however, a significant rise or fall between appropriately timed acute convalescent or early-late convalescent sera is diagnostic.</p><p>West Nile has emerged as the most common cause of viral encephalitis in the United States. A single specimen looking for IgM antibodies in the serum or CSF is sufficient for diagnosis. A single serum specimen can also be used to diagnose mumps. Serology may also be helpful in obtaining evidence for primary Epstein-Barr virus infection, a rare cause of meningoencephalitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=st-louis-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;St. Louis encephalitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-west-nile-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of West Nile virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a last resort, brain biopsy can be considered in the patient if the etiology of encephalitis is still unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Definitive diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of identification of a specific agent in patients with aseptic meningitis and encephalitis has been variable and depends upon the population studied and the mode of testing. The following illustrates the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 432 high-risk patients who underwent brain biopsy of presumptive herpes simplex encephalitis, 45 percent had the diagnosis confirmed, 9 percent had another virus detected, and 9 percent had another treatable cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This underscores the point that the clinical diagnosis of HSV encephalitis is often incorrect and needs to be confirmed by PCR testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 334 patients with a case definition of encephalitis in the California Encephalitis Project, a confirmed or probable viral cause was present in 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]; a possible cause was identified in 12 percent, a noninfectious etiology in 10 percent, and a bacterial cause in 3 percent. Despite extensive testing, 62 percent of cases were unexplained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series from the New York State Department of Health of 106 patients with presumed viral CNS infection seen in 1997 and 1998, PCR testing revealed a viral cause in 38 (36 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The rate of detection in earlier time periods before PCR testing was much lower (about 10 percent), employing cell culture and serologic testing.</p><p/><p>In a later, larger series of almost 3500 patients from the same laboratory, PCR identified a viral etiology in CSF or brain tissue in only 14 percent (498 patients); selection bias may have accounted for much of the difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The most common viral causes were enterovirus (72 percent), herpes simplex (15 percent), VZV (6 percent), and West Nile virus (4 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is critical that the clinician considers a broad range of causes when evaluating patients who present with encephalitis. Only some of the causes are infectious, and not all infections are viral.</p><p>A number of noninfectious etiologies can mimic central nervous system (CNS) infections. These include primary intracranial or metastatic tumors, adverse effects of medications, and autoimmune or paraneoplastic diseases, such as those associated with vasculitis or the anti-NDMA receptor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77933\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77933 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nonviral infectious etiologies to consider in the patient with suspected CNS infection include brain abscess, syphilis, tuberculous meningitis, and fungal meningitis (eg, coccidioides), which can affect the sensorium. Amoebic encephalitis, often associated with freshwater swimming, should also be an occasional consideration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain abscess&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-nervous-system-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central nervous system tuberculosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidal-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidal meningitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurosyphilis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurosyphilis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Knowledge of the patient's underlying immune status is also critical, since the differential diagnosis is even broader in immunocompromised hosts (eg, toxoplasmic encephalitis and cryptococcal meningitis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent hosts&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">EMPIRIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no specific therapies for most central nervous system (CNS) viral infections. However, some important exceptions apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empiric treatment for herpes simplex virus (HSV) -1 infection with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously every eight hours) should always be initiated as soon as possible if the patient has encephalitis without apparent explanation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Early therapy is vital because it is associated with a significant decrease in mortality and morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpes simplex virus type 1 encephalitis&quot;</a>). Acyclovir should also be considered if varicella zoster virus encephalitis is likely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since a number of other treatable illnesses may present in a similar manner to viral CNS infections, consideration of alternative diagnoses, such as tuberculosis and drug-induced delirium, is essential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77933\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77933 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>A list of the major pathogens that produce the clinical syndrome of encephalitis, along with suggested initial treatment, appears in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69990\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69990 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27776766\"><span class=\"h1\">INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms and signs of increased intracranial pressure include headache, vomiting, and a decreased level of consciousness. Information on the incidence or management of raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure in patients with viral encephalitis is limited. </p><p>All of the &quot;standard&quot; therapeutic interventions for lowering CSF pressure (eg, steroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>) have been used in this setting, but none have been shown to be of well-established benefit. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> has been shown to reduce brain edema and improve neurologic outcomes in patients with pneumococcal meningitis, there are only limited retrospective data on the use of steroids in viral encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]; extrapolating these data to patients with viral encephalitis may not be valid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dexamethasone to prevent neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, serial intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring should be part of the management of a patient with encephalitis with documented elevated ICP, since this parameter has been associated with a negative prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Relieving elevated ICP may decrease secondary brain injury while the patient is responding to anti-infective therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/viral-encephalitis-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Whether any of these interventions may have a positive impact on outcome has not been determined in prospective clinical trials. </p><p>Various strategies to reduce intracranial pressure are discussed elsewhere.

Sixty-one percent survived without sequelae, while 18 percent were mildly impaired, 14 percent were severely impaired, and 1 percent remained in a vegetative state.

Patients may be lethargic but have a normal sensorium. By contrast, patients with encephalitis present with mental status changes. Patients with features of both may be considered to have a meningoencephalitis.

A lymphocytic predominance is suggestive of a viral etiology; red blood cells in the absence of a traumatic tap is suggestive of HSV or other necrotizing viral encephalitides. The most important diagnostic consideration in patients with encephalitis is HSV, since delay in treatment can impact morbidity and mortality.

Testing for other viral pathogens will depend on travel or exposure history to insects and animals. Serologic testing for West Nile virus, mumps, and Epstein-Barr virus can also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the patient with encephalitis, we recommend rapid initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> three times daily intravenously for empiric treatment of HSV while awaiting confirmation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).
