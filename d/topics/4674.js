Piloerection, commonly known as &quot;goose bumps,&quot; is an involuntary process that may occur upon cold exposure as well as a variety of emotional states (eg, fear, pleasure). </p><p>Cutaneous leiomyomas may occur sporadically or in multiple numbers as part of an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome called hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC, MIM #150800) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The discovery in 2001 of the association between cutaneous leiomyomas, uterine leiomyomas in women, and an aggressive form of renal cell cancer (RCC) underscores the importance of accurate dermatologic diagnosis of CL so that appropriate cancer screening and counseling of patients and at-risk relatives can be instituted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>This topic will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of HLRCC.

It is now well established that all of these syndromes are associated with mutations in the fumarate hydratase gene (<em>FH</em>). (See <a href=\"#H1861536\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1861530\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is unknown. Worldwide, approximately 200 families have been identified. The overall penetrance of HLRCC in affected families approaches 90 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, in individuals with a fumarate hydratase (<em>FH</em>) mutation, cutaneous leiomyomas and uterine leiomyomas are much more penetrant (76 to 100 percent and 80 to 90 percent, respectively) than renal cell cancer (15 to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1861536\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) is caused by autosomal dominantly inherited germline heterozygous mutations in the fumarate hydratase gene (<em>FH</em>) on chromosome 1q42.2, encoding the Krebs cycle enzyme responsible for the conversion of fumarate to malate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This disorder must be differentiated from fumarase deficiency (MIM #606812), an autosomal recessive condition that is lethal in the neonatal period due to neurologic disease and is associated with homozygous or compound heterozygous germline <em>FH</em> hydratase mutations. </p><p>Germline <em>FH</em> heterozygous mutations have been identified in 76 to 100 percent of families with clinical features suggestive of HLRCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Inactivating <em>FH </em>mutations are thought to lead to tumorigenesis via activation of the hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway. Impairment of oxidative phosphorylation leads to oxidative stress, inhibiting HIF prolyl hydroxylase, which in turn stabilizes HIF-1-alpha, resulting in transcription of genes integral for tumor vascularity, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56466874\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologically, cutaneous leiomyomas (CL) are characterized by interlacing bundles of smooth muscle cells in the upper dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F100297\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100297 \">picture 1</a>). Increased nerve density has been described within CL lesions compared with the surrounding dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Uterine leiomyomas in the hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) setting are often multiple, large (1 to 8.5 cm), and histologically show characteristic inclusion-like nucleoli. Occasional mitosis is also a feature of HLRCC-associated uterine leiomyomas, but tumor cell necrosis and atypical mitosis suggestive of leiomyosarcoma are not typically seen. Indeed, one study reported that HLRCC uterine leiomyomas demonstrate increased cellularity, atypia, and occasional mitoses, as compared with sporadic leiomyomas, but do not fulfill criteria for malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Renal cell carcinoma in HLRCC demonstrates a unique papillary histology distinct from the classic papillary type I pattern associated with hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma (MIM #605074) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cells in the renal cancers associated with HLRCC have a characteristic large nucleus with prominent orangeophilic or eosinophilic nucleolus surrounded by a clear halo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These tumors, previously called type II papillary renal cell cancer (RCC) and subsequently reclassified as &quot;HLRCC-associated RCC&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], are highly aggressive and frequently metastasize when the primary tumor is still quite small (&lt;1 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Abnormal succination of cellular proteins has been demonstrated by immunohistochemical detection of S-(2-succino)-cysteine (2SC) in renal tumors in affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Similarly, the immunohistochemical detection of 2SC in cutaneous leiomyomas improves the diagnostic accuracy of HLRCC, compared with the loss of fumarate hydratase staining alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1861542\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59734384\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous leiomyomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous leiomyomas typically present as a firm, flesh-colored nodules, ranging in size from 3 mm to 1 cm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F100292\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100292 \">picture 2B</a>).

Rarely, isolated leiomyomas may develop from specialized smooth muscle of the scrotum (dartos muscle), vulva, or nipple (areolar smooth muscle). In contrast to piloleiomyoma, leiomyomas derived from genital skin are usually asymptomatic.</p><p>In individuals with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC), multiple cutaneous leiomyomas develop in early adulthood (mean age 25 years) as discrete or agminated pink to tan nodules, most frequently on the trunk, particularly the upper back, as well as the upper and lower extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F100291%7EDERM%2F100292%7EDERM%2F100270%7EDERM%2F100290%7EDERM%2F100296%7EDERM%2F100293%7EDERM%2F100295\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100291 graphicRef100292 graphicRef100270 graphicRef100290 graphicRef100296 graphicRef100293 graphicRef100295 \">picture 2A-G</a>). Three patterns have been described: scattered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F100290\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100290 \">picture 2D</a>), segmental (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F100270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100270 \">picture 2C</a>), and disseminated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F100296\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100296 \">picture 2E</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Multiple patterns may occur in the same patient. </p><p>Although patients with HLRCC usually have multiple cutaneous leiomyomas, there are several reports of patients with a family history of renal cell cancer (RCC) and germline fumarate hydratase (<em>FH</em>) mutations who have small numbers of leiomyomas, a single cutaneous leiomyoma, or lack any cutaneous manifestations of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. </p><p>The hallmark clinical symptom of cutaneous leiomyomas is pain, reported in approximately 90 percent of patients. Pain may be provoked by ambient cold or ice provocation, light touch, pressure, or incidental contact and may be sharp, shooting discomfort, or may have an aching quality. Pain contributes to moderate to severe impairment in quality of life in approximately 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Although pain is a consistent feature of most cutaneous leiomyomas, the intensity is highly variable among patients, and patients may not volunteer this symptom if pain is infrequent or relatively mild. A history of episodic pain upon cold exposure, rubbing, or pressure is a classic sign associated with cutaneous leiomyomas. The mechanism of pain associated with cutaneous leiomyomas is poorly understood, but may be related to neuropeptide release, pressure on nerve fibers within lesions, or contraction of the arrector pili muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59734390\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine leiomyomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine leiomyomas are common in the general population, but are, in most cases, small and asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. In the HLRCC setting, uterine leiomyomas develop at an earlier age than in the general population, tend to be large and multiple, and are symptomatic in the majority of cases.

In one review of 67 women with <em>FH</em> mutations, 76 percent were diagnosed with uterine leiomyomas at a median age of 30 years (range 19 to 47 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Ninety percent of the women with uterine fibroids were symptomatic and 65 percent underwent hysterectomy at a median age of 34 years (range 27 to 47 years). In another study of 75 women with <em>FH</em> mutations, 85 percent had uterine fibroids diagnosed at a median age of 28 years&nbsp;and approximately 50 percent underwent hysterectomy before the age of 43 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59734396\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of renal cell cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lifetime renal cancer risk in HLRCC is approximately 15 percent and the median age at diagnosis is 42 to 44 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21</a>]. However, an 11-year-old patient with RCC has been described in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Because genotypic correlation between specific <em>FH</em> mutations and RCC risk and phenotypic correlation between cutaneous or uterine leiomyoma burden and RCC risk are not possible, all individuals known to have an <em>FH</em> mutation and those suspected to have an <em>FH</em> mutation (eg, individuals with multiple cutaneous leiomyomas or early onset uterine leiomyomas) should be screened for RCC. &#160;</p><p>HLRCC-associated renal tumors are typically solitary and unilateral, and are among the most aggressive of heritable renal cancers.

Although DNA testing of late-onset hereditary cancer syndromes is generally recommended at age 16 to 18 when the individual can provide informed consent, there is a small but definite risk of RCC prior to this age, suggesting that genetic screening should be considered at an earlier age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Ultrasound may not detect small tumors and is not recommended unless no other modality is available. Prompt surgical intervention with wide surgical margins and consideration of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection are recommended even for small tumors, given the aggressive metastatic potential of HLRCC-associated RCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-leiomyomatosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].
