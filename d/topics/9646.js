They form when salts and minerals that are normally in the urine build up and harden.</p><p>Kidney stones usually get carried out of the body when you urinate. But sometimes they can get stuck on the way out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>). If that happens, the stones can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in your side or in the lower part of your belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the urine (which can make urine pink or red)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain when you urinate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need to urinate in a hurry</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295981375\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I have kidney stones?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your doctor or nurse thinks you have kidney stones, he or she can order an imaging test that can show the stones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295981382\"><span class=\"h1\">How are kidney stones treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each person's treatment is a little different. The right treatment for you will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size, type, and location of your stone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much pain you have</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much you are vomiting</p><p/><p>If your stone is big or causes severe symptoms, you might need to stay in the hospital. If your stone is small and causes only mild symptoms, you might be able to stay home and wait for it to pass in the urine. If you stay home, you will probably need to drink a lot of fluids. Plus, you might need to take pain medicines or medicines that make it easier to pass the stone.</p><p>Stones that do not pass on their own can be treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A machine that uses sound waves to break up stones into smaller pieces. This is called &quot;shock wave lithotripsy.&quot; This procedure does not involve surgery, but it can be painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A special kind of surgery that makes very small holes in your skin. During this surgery, the doctor passes tiny tools through the holes and into the kidney. Then he or she removes the stone. This is called &quot;percutaneous nephrolithotomy.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thin tube that goes into your body the same way urine comes out. Doctors use tools at the end of the tube to break up or remove stones. This is called &quot;ureteroscopy.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295981389\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to keep from getting kidney stones again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One simple thing you can do is to drink plenty of water. You might also need to change what you eat, depending on what your kidney stones were made of. If so, your doctor or nurse can tell you which foods to avoid. Your doctor or nurse might also prescribe you new medicines to keep you from having another kidney stone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H295981396\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Kidney stones in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
