In the preantibiotic era, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> was responsible for &gt;75 percent of cases of pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, more recent studies have isolated the organism in only 5 to 15 percent of cases in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>] but in a higher proportion of cases in some other countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/2,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,11</a>]. Factors that are likely to have contributed to the decline in <em>S. pneumoniae</em> as a cause of CAP in the United States include the use of pneumococcal vaccines in adults, the universal use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children (leading to herd immunity), and a reduction in cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. The impact of pneumococcal vaccination on the incidence of pneumonia is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to note that the rate of isolation increases when more invasive methods are used for obtaining specimens, such as transtracheal aspiration, which eliminates contaminating oropharyngeal flora; this method was used in the past but is no longer used. It is believed that many culture-negative cases are caused by pneumococcus. One factor arguing for the predominance of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> as a cause of CAP is that, in patients with CAP who have positive blood cultures, 58 to 81 percent of bloodstream isolates are <em>S. pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]; however, only 7 to 10 percent of patients with CAP have positive blood cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1,6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,13</a>]. One group has estimated that, for every case of bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, there are at least three additional cases of nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76306199\"><span class=\"h3\">Influenza infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Influenza infection greatly predisposes to secondary pneumococcal pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Multiple elements of host defenses are impaired in chronic alcohol abuse including decreased cough and epiglottis reflex, defects in mucociliary clearance, suppression of cytokine and chemokine responses, and multiple effects on neutrophil function (adhesion, migration to site of infection, and killing of pneumococci). Suppression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor leads to neutropenia, which is a factor in the more severe infections seen in these patients. If cirrhosis is present, complement production is decreased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive pneumococcal disease was associated with cigarette smoking (odds ratio [OR] 4.1, 95% CI 2.4-7.3) and with passive smoke exposure (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.1) in a case-control study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

There are conflicting data regarding the risk among patients with asthma. In a case-control study, patients with asthma had a twofold increase in risk for invasive pneumococcal disease compared with non-asthmatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], although, in a separate cohort study, asthmatics did not have increased rates of hospitalization for pneumococcal pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Patients with disease involving the reticuloendothelial system are at greater risk than those who underwent splenectomy for traumatic injury. All patients who have undergone splenectomy should receive pneumococcal vaccine. If splenectomy is performed as an elective procedure, pneumococcal vaccine should be administered at least two weeks, and preferably one month, prior to the procedure.

In the pre-antiretroviral era, there was a 50- to 100-fold increase in invasive pneumococcal disease among persons infected with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. For HIV-infected patients who were vaccinated with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine during childhood, there has been a decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease caused by vaccine serotypes but an increase in disease due to nonvaccine serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Even with the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in HIV-infected individuals remains significantly higher than in HIV-uninfected persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In populations without access to antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in HIV-infected persons is 43 times that of HIV-uninfected persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Other causes of immunocompromise are also associated with increased risk for pneumococcal disease.

Colonization is present in 40 to 50 percent of healthy adults and persists for four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Carriage may involve more than one serotype at a time. Disease occurs most frequently upon acquisition of a serotype different from those with which an individual may be colonized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Pneumococcal carriage is more common in smokers than nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Colonization with pneumococcus is more common in children than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>], and young children are responsible for the majority of new serotypes introduced into a household [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Asymptomatic pneumococcal colonization in children has been implicated as a reservoir for penicillin- or antibiotic-resistant strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, some resistant strains do not appear to be easily transmitted to adults, as illustrated in a study from a kibbutz in Israel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine the relatedness of pneumococci did not find that children in daycare centers passed their resistant strains to their parents or other adults in the kibbutz.</p><p>Prolonged courses of antibiotics may increase the likelihood of colonization with antibiotic-resistant <em>S. pneumoniae</em>. As an example, a study evaluated the risk of carriage of penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococci in children receiving a 5-day course of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> versus a standard 10-day regimen of amoxicillin for the treatment of respiratory tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The risk of carriage of strains that were not susceptible to either penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> was lower in the group receiving the shorter course of high-dose amoxicillin; the overall risk of carriage of nonsusceptible strains was increased in both groups that received antibiotics compared with baseline.</p><p>Although children are more frequently colonized than adults, outbreaks of pneumococcal pneumonia in nursing homes have demonstrated high rates of nasopharyngeal carriage among residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF PULMONARY INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumococcal pneumonia is the paradigm of classic lobar bacterial pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Pneumococcus is acquired in the nasopharynx and is carried asymptomatically in approximately 40 to 50 percent of individuals at any point in time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Invasive disease, defined by the isolation of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> from a normally sterile site (eg, blood, cerebrospinal fluid but not sputum), most commonly occurs upon acquisition of a new serotype, typically after an incubation period of one to three days.</p><p>The development of pneumococcal pneumonia becomes more likely when the dose of inhaled or aspirated pneumococci overwhelms the host defense system in the respiratory tract. The relationship between the inoculum dose of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and pneumonia onset was examined in a rabbit model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Inoculation of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> at a dose of &gt;10<sup>5</sup> organisms was followed by the development of pneumonia in &ge;90 percent of rabbits. In contrast, lower doses caused pneumonia in &lt;20 percent of inoculated rabbits.</p><p>Pneumococci are presumably aerosolized from the nasopharynx to the alveolus where they enter alveolar type II cells. This process involves bacterial binding to the receptor for platelet-activating factor (PAF), a key pulmonary chemokine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This attachment occurs through bacterial display of surface-localized choline, a chemical constituent shared between the bacteria and the human chemokine PAF. Choline has been found on the surface of many pulmonary pathogens, suggesting a common motif for disease at this body site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The host innate defense element C-reactive protein binds to choline and opsonizes these pathogens if they pass from the lungs into the bloodstream. Thus, choline is useful in attaching to the lung but detrimental to the organism in the bloodstream.

Pneumococci pass from alveolus to alveolus through the pores of Cohn, thereby creating inflammation and consolidation strictly along lobar compartments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65658\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65658 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64692\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64692 \">image 2</a>).

This lesion can be recapitulated by instillation of heat-killed pneumococci into the lung and, therefore, may result from the host response to the pneumococcal cell wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The engorgement stage rapidly progresses to red hepatization characterized by a dry, granular, dark red lung surface and alveoli filled with copious, clotted inflammatory exudate. A distinctive feature of the exudate is its &quot;freshness&quot; in that erythrocytes and leukocytes are intact and a fibrin network extends from one alveolus into the next through the pores of Cohn. Pneumococci are intact and alive. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contains high amounts of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, and nitric oxide, reflective of strong recruitment of leukocytes to the infected focus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. There is little tissue destruction or necrosis during this process, however, perhaps explaining why the patient and lung architecture may often recover fully from these lesions. Infrequently, infection with <em>S. pneumoniae</em> can lead to a necrotizing pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

This classical presentation, however, typically occurs in younger patients. With increasing age of the population, older patients more frequently develop pneumococcal pneumonia and exhibit fewer symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Tachypnea and increasing systemic toxicity follow initial symptom onset.

In a multicenter study, 56 patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (BPP) were compared with 394 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and negative blood cultures.

Before stopping therapy, the patient should be afebrile for 48 to 72 hours, breathing without supplemental oxygen (unless required for preexisting disease), and clinically stable. It should be noted, however, that some patients with pneumococcal pneumonia have a low-grade fever (&le;38&ordm;C) for several days, despite clinical improvement. The duration of therapy for CAP is discussed in greater detail separately.

In patients who are improving on therapy, we suggest switching from combination therapy to monotherapy once susceptibilities are known, which is usually two to three days after cultures are obtained. For patients who remain critically ill in the intensive care unit, we suggest continuing combination therapy until a response to therapy is observed. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Therapy for critical illness'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with bacteremic pneumococcal disease, we continue antimicrobial therapy for a total of 10 to 14 days.

The mortality rate increased in proportion to the PSI score at admission and was greater among those with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia than among those with nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia. A limitation of this study is that patients were compared with men of a similar age published in a mortality database. It was therefore not possible to control for potential confounders, such as underlying medical conditions. The authors conclude that pneumococcal pneumonia may be a surrogate for an imminent decline in overall state of health. Although the reasons for increased long-term mortality remain unknown, possible factors could include underlying comorbidities that predispose to infection, chronic sequelae of acute cardiac events during the pneumonia, and an underlying inflammatory state.</p><p>Long-term outcomes and the association between community-acquired pneumonia and acute cardiac events are discussed in detail separately.

In the preantibiotic era, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> was responsible for &gt;75 percent of cases of pneumonia. However, more recent studies have isolated the organism in only 5 to 15 percent of cases in the United States but in a higher proportion of cases in some other countries. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumococcal pneumonia is the paradigm of classic lobar bacterial pneumonia. Although commonly carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx, pneumococci cause invasive disease when the host is exposed to large aerosolized inocula of new serotypes. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of pulmonary infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic presentation of pneumococcal pneumonia, with abrupt onset of fever, chills, cough, and side pain, occurs more commonly in the younger patient. Physical examination typically reveals signs of consolidation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious complications involving other organ systems, once prevalent with pneumococcal infection, are now rare with antibiotic use. However, overwhelming infection can still lead to early mortality (often in the first 24 hours) despite use of antibiotics. Pulmonary complications associated with bacteremic illness and comorbidities include empyema, necrotizing pneumonia, and lung abscess. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While sputum Gram stain can suggest pneumococcal infection, the diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia should be confirmed by blood culture or urinary antigen. Although lobar consolidation is suggestive of bacterial pneumonia, radiographs cannot reliably differentiate bacterial from nonbacterial pneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with community-acquired pneumonia are treated empirically with a regimen that is likely to have activity against pneumococcus. The appropriate regimen depends upon several factors including comorbidities, the need for hospitalization, and risk factors for antibiotic resistance.
