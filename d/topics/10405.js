These injuries are commonly treated in an outpatient setting. Nail bed lacerations require careful repair and measures to preserve the nail folds and germinal matrix. Complete fingertip avulsions require debridement, cleansing, and local wound care.</p><p>The repair of nail bed lacerations and fingertip avulsions are reviewed here. The management of subungual hematoma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subungual-hematoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subungual hematoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1958511\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated nail bed injury typically occurs as a result of direct blunt trauma (eg, crush in a door jamb). A nail bed injury almost always accompanies a partial or complete fingertip avulsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Fingertip avulsions often occur in the setting of door closure upon the finger, either along the edge of the door on the side of the hinge or the latch. Most avulsions are partial avulsions of the fingertip, although full amputations are not rare. </p><p>Fingertip avulsions are also caused by knives, slicers, exercise equipment (eg, treadmills, exercise bicycles), power tools, and lawn mowers. In contrast to adults, complete or partial avulsions heal extremely well in children especially before adolescence. In particular, the literature indicates that children younger than two years of age are very likely to demonstrate complete distal tip regeneration after amputation when managed without repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17719243\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper management of fingertip injuries requires knowledge of anatomy of the nail bed as well as familiarity with the motor and neurovascular anatomy of the finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76994\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76994 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nail bed is a thin layer of epithelial tissue overlying the cortex of the distal phalanx.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin that covers the proximal end is called the proximal fold or eponychium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin edge at the distal nail margin is called the hyponychium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lateral margins of the nail are held in place by the lateral skin folds of the fingertip. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The richly vascularized nail bed lies directly beneath the nail plate and provides adherence and support for the nail. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cuticle, an outgrowth of the proximal fold, provides a seal between the proximal fold and the nail plate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The germinal matrix is the proximal element of the nail bed responsible for most of the nail formation. The matrix begins 7 to 8 mm under the proximal fold, and its distal end is the white crescent called the lunula. </p><p/><p>The fingertip has a rich blood supply provided by numerous branches of the ulnar and radial elements of the digital arteries. The pad of the fingertip is composed of fatty and soft tissues with dense sensory innervation provided by the palmar digital nerves. Extension and flexion of the fingertip are provided by the extensor hood tendons and flexor digitorum profundus, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;, section on 'Finger extension'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;, section on 'Finger flexion and pulley system'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2001263\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND PRECAUTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should perform primary repair of nail bed injuries that are uninfected and less than 24 hours old. The nail must be removed completely for adequate examination and repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Complete fingertip avulsions require debridement and cleansing regardless of when the injury occurred. Small nail bed lacerations in which the nail is solidly intact within the nail folds do not require nail removal and repair. If a painful subungual hematoma is present in such patients, then trephination should be performed instead. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subungual-hematoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subungual hematoma&quot;, section on 'Nail trephination'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1959144\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following injuries warrant consultation with a hand surgeon, if available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infected wounds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fingertip injuries with associated tendon injuries</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finger fractures (other than tuft fractures) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-phalanx-fractures#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal phalanx fractures&quot;, section on 'Indications for surgical referral'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complicated digit dislocations (eg, open dislocation) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digit-dislocation-reduction#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digit dislocation reduction&quot;, section on 'Contraindications and precautions'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large soft tissue injuries (&gt;1 cm) in children with absent, destroyed, or heavily contaminated tissues requiring nail bed or skin grafting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive proximal germinal matrix avulsion </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive laceration that extends beneath the proximal fold (eponychium) that will require exposure and repair of the germinal matrix </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amputations with significant bone exposure</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17719257\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452522\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper management of nail bed lacerations and fingertip avulsions requires careful evaluation, including assessment for associated injuries and plain radiographs, prior to definitive care. This assessment should identify conditions that warrant prompt referral to a hand or orthopedic surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H2001263\" class=\"local\">'Indications, contraindications, and precautions'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History</strong> &ndash; Key historical elements include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age and skeletal maturity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mechanism and time of injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Digit position during injury (flexed versus extended)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dominant hand</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Occupation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prior hand conditions, injuries, or interventions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> &ndash; The clinician should determine the extent of damage to the nail, nail folds, nail bed, and germinal matrix by inspection and evaluate for associated proximal injuries to the finger or hand by testing neurovascular status and range of motion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Findings of nail bed laceration include subungual hematoma, bleeding from under the nail and disruption or dislocation of the nail plate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vascular compromise is suggested by the presence of distal pallor. The vascular status of fingers is also evaluated using capillary refill time. Although standard values for capillary refill time increase with age and certain disease states (eg, diabetes), normal capillary refill is generally less than two seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Comparison of capillary refill time with an unaffected finger assists with interpretation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Two-point discrimination is the most sensitive test for sensation in the fingers. In cooperative patients, a paper clip opened and bent into a caliper with the points at 10 mm is commonly used. The patient is asked to close his or her eyes, and the paper clip points are placed against the skin along the long axis of the finger. The touch should be relatively light so as to minimize the stimulation of pressure receptors. It is important to assess sensation on both the radial and ulnar aspects of the finger as well as the dorsal and palmar sides. The points of the paper clip are gradually brought closer together; two point discrimination of 4 to 5 mm is normal for most patients, with an upper limit of normal of 8 to 9 mm in older adult patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In cooperative younger children, it may only be possible to test light touch. A cotton tipped swab touched lightly on all aspects of the finger may suffice for this examination. Finally, in very young or uncooperative children, the clinician may not be able to discern the presence or absence of nerve injury. Indirect evidence of intact sensory innervation is obtained by placing the finger in a bowl of warm water for five minutes. Intact innervation is indicated by wrinkling of the skin of the distal finger, whereas nerve injury results in persistence of smooth skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The detailed evaluation of range of motion of the finger and detection of fractures and dislocations is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digit-dislocation-reduction#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digit dislocation reduction&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-phalanx-fractures#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal phalanx fractures&quot;, section on 'Symptoms and physical examination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plain radiographs</strong> &ndash; AP and true lateral plain radiographs are necessary before repair of a nail bed laceration or fingertip amputation to exclude associated fractures and to assist in identifying complex dislocations or fractures that warrant referral to a hand surgeon. Distal tuft fractures are the most common associated injuries seen with fingertip avulsions, occurring in up to 50 percent of injuries, and do not significantly alter their immediate management, although the presence of a tuft fracture warrants splinting of the fingertip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452530\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient counseling and informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with fingertip injuries are usually anxious and in pain. The patient and, for children, the caretaker should receive an explanation of the injury and the procedural approach. In patients with significant nail bed lacerations and suspected damage to the area near the germinal matrix, the patient and family should be advised that a deformed or absent nail may occur on the finger despite appropriate treatment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452538\"><span class=\"h2\">Local anesthesia, analgesia, and sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate analgesia, local anesthesia, and, especially in children, distraction by a child life specialist or other personnel, may help to decrease the anxiety and pain of the procedure and promote successful repair. A digital block often provides adequate analgesia in older adolescents and adults, and in most children. Because it is less traumatic, we prefer to use the transthecal or subcutaneous approaches, especially in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digital-nerve-block#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digital nerve block&quot;, section on 'Transthecal block'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digital-nerve-block#H4362682\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digital nerve block&quot;, section on 'Subcutaneous block'</a>.) </p><p>Parenteral analgesia is rarely required, particularly given the effectiveness of a digital nerve block. In younger or uncooperative children, anxiolytics via either an oral or intranasal route may suffice to gain cooperation. At times, procedural sedation may be warranted.

As an example, in a study of 40 consecutive patients with acute nail bed lacerations, there was no statistical difference in physician-judged or patient-perceived cosmetic outcome, pain or functional ability between repairs performed using skin glue versus 6-0 chromic suture. In addition, the average time for repair was clinically significantly shorter for the skin glue group (10 versus 28 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a systematic review of six studies (118 patients), including this randomized study, use of tissue adhesives was considered as effective as sutures for nail bed laceration repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protect the repaired nail bed by splinting with the original nail, if possible:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gently clean the nail in a dilute solution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> and normal saline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Place a large hole, 3 to 4 mm in diameter, in the center of the nail using a sterile needle, scalpel, or electrocautery to allow drainage. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Replace the nail beneath the proximal fold (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72699 \">picture 4</a>).

The nail should be positioned in precise anatomic position by ensuring that the proximal aspect of the nail is underneath the eponychium in order to protect the germinal matrix. Place two to three drops of tissue glue in the areas of the nail folds and allow the stream of adhesive to seal the nail to the skin. Alternatively, the nail plate may be sutured in place through the lateral skin folds with two 4.0 chromic sutures. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Although silicone splints are available, a retrospective analysis of complications after nail splinting with native nail versus silicone nail revealed significantly fewer nail deformities when the native nail was replaced compared with splinting with a silicone product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the original nail cannot be used, place a <strong>nonadherent</strong> splint consisting of a single thickness of nonadherent sterile gauze (eg, Telfa gauze), 0.20 inch reinforced silicon sheeting, or sterile foil from the suture packet in the proximal fold and suture in place through the lateral skin folds using absorbable 4-0 suture or use skin glue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86803\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86803 \">picture 5</a>).

Complete soft tissue avulsions or amputations can have fairly good results in young children younger than two to three years of age when the tip is cleaned, defatted and reapproximated as described for partial fingertip avulsions above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Discussion with a hand surgeon is warranted for such injuries in older patients if the clinician is uncertain about the best approach. </p><p>Complete amputations of the fingertip involving no or minimal exposed distal phalangeal bone are best managed by wound irrigation, debridement, and application of a nonadherent sterile dressing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. Exposed bone need not be shortened, particularly in patients younger than 12 years of age. If extensive tissue loss has occurred in the presence of exposed bone, patients should receive prompt consultation from a hand surgeon, if available. (See <a href=\"#H1959144\" class=\"local\">'Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2278833\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28679206\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that healthy patients with clean or minimally contaminated fingertip injuries <strong>not</strong> receive empiric antibiotics. This recommendation is based upon the following evidence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An unblinded trial of 135 children under 18 years of age with fingertip injuries found no significant difference in infection rates among those who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a> or no antibiotic after repair (6 versus 3 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. None of the 52 patients with associated tuft fractures developed infections, including 22 patients who also received no antibiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blinded trial of 193 adults with open distal phalanx fractures, including nail bed injuries and fingertip avulsions or amputations, demonstrated no significant difference in infection rates between those who received flucloxacillin and placebo (3 and 4 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an unblinded trial of prophylactic antibiotics in 58 adults with fingertip amputation and exposed bone, all repaired in an operating suite, no infection occurred in any patient, including the 29 patients who received no antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p>These findings are consistent with several other studies in healthy patients that demonstrate no reduction in infection risk following wound repair when prophylactic antibiotics are used, including patients with simple hand lacerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Some experts advocate prophylactic antibiotics in patients with excessive wound contamination (eg, soil contamination), vascular insufficiency (eg, devascularized wound, peripheral artery disease), or immunocompromise, although there is little evidence to support this practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures#H38\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closure of minor skin wounds with sutures&quot;, section on 'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p>Prophylactic antibiotics reduce the rate of infection due to some animal bites, especially cat bites. Although routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for all bite wounds, prophylaxis is warranted for bite wounds to the hand, including fingertip injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-dog-and-cat-bites#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to dog and cat bites&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to human bites&quot;, section on 'Prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>Proper wound care including consisting of copious irrigation and removal of contaminants and dead tissue, as needed, are the most effective means to reduce infection.

If the bandage should become wet or soiled prior to this visit, the patient should urgently return to have the wound redressed. Pain management consists of elevation of the hand above the heart and oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>). Oral opioid medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a>) are also necessary for patients with extensive injury. Patients and caretakers should understand that blood may continue to ooze under the nail for one to two days. Excessive soiling of the dressing, hemorrhage, fever, redness extending up the finger, or marked dorsal hand swelling are indications for emergent reevaluation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2278841\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further follow-up and care are based upon the type of injury:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fingertip skin avulsions</strong> &ndash; Small defects (&lt;1 cm) and sutured injuries warrant follow-up with the primary care provider for a wound check in two to three days. If the wound is sutured, the patient or caregiver should be advised at that visit that the sutured skin will likely not survive but that it will serve as a biological dressing and eventually slough off. Continued home care consists of keeping the wound clean and dry and daily to every other day dressing changes. Additional wound checks are at the discretion of the provider. A typical approach is to evaluate the wound again in approximately two weeks when healing should be well established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Grafted defects should undergo follow-up as determined by the hand surgeon. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nail bed repair and sutured partial fingertip avulsions or amputations</strong> &ndash; The patient should follow-up with a hand surgeon in five to seven days. The bandage should remain intact until the initial visit with the hand surgeon. Thereafter, the timing of dressing changes and additional wound checks should be frequent enough to observe for problems with healing or infection but spaced such that disruption of wound and nail bed revascularization is minimized; this may vary according to the degree of injury. A weekly wound check is a common practice among hand surgeons. Some specialists advise every other day dressing changes while others prefer to only perform dressing changes as part of the wound check. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients and caretakers should understand that the sutured nail is acting only to maintain patency of the proximal fold by preventing adhesions between the eponychium and nail bed and that it will fall off within one to three weeks. Ultimately, a new nail will require 3 to 12 months to grow in again [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a tuft fracture is present, then finger splinting should continue for at least 14 days. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complete amputations &ndash; </strong>These injuries warrant follow-up with a hand surgeon in five to seven days. The bandage should remain intact until the initial visit with the hand surgeon. After the initial visit, these wounds should undergo regular dressing changes as determined by the hand surgeon. Regular evaluation is advised until healing is complete.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1958641\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications consist of abnormality of nail growth and wound infections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal nail growth &ndash; Normal nail growth following a nail bed laceration requires a smooth nail bed. Extensive injury or failure to precisely approximate the nail bed may result in an irregular contour of or a nonadherent nail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/7-9,11,12,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,11,12,26</a>]. Scarring of the germinal matrix may result in failure of nail regrowth or an abnormally formed fingernail (eg, hypoplastic nail). Scarring of the nail bed results in a nail that fails to adhere to the underlying nail bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/8,9,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,26</a>]. Scar tissue formation may also result in a hyperaesthetic nail bed and fingertip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Scarring of the proximal (eponychial) fold may yield a split nail or pain as the nail grows through the adhesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Lateral fold scarring may result in ingrown nails [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Meticulous repair of the nail bed with careful approximation of the nail folds, minimal debridement of the nail bed, and use of the minimum number of sutures to adequately close the nail bed wound serve to minimize these undesirable cosmetic outcomes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound infection &ndash; The reported infection rate after hand and fingertip injuries is approximately 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-fingertip-injuries/abstract/19,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,27</a>]. Careful wound debridement and irrigation are most important in preventing this complication. Prophylactic antibiotics do not significantly alter the rate of infection in healthy patients with minimally contaminated wounds.
