Reflux symptoms were present in 164 patients (82 percent), of whom 118 (72 percent) had increased esophageal acid contact times. Among the patients with asthma and GE reflux, 80 percent reported respiratory symptoms that were associated with esophageal acid events.

Furthermore, gastroesophageal (GE) reflux can illicit neuroinflammation and increase exhaled oxidative stress biomarkers (8-isoprostane) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased vagal tone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of observations suggest that exposure of the esophagus to acid can cause bronchoconstriction via a vagal mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Bernstein test is performed by alternately infusing saline or acid into the mid-esophagus via a nasogastric tube or manometric assembly. A positive test is defined as reproduction of the patient's symptoms with acid perfusion but not with saline. Among patients with asthma who have a positive Bernstein test, a 10 percent increase in total respiratory resistance is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) was detected during acid infusion into the esophagus in normal controls, patients with asthma plus GE reflux, patients with asthma without GE reflux, and patients with GE reflux alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Measures taken to improve esophageal acid clearance resulted in improved PEF in all groups except for the patients with asthma and GE reflux. These effects occurred with acid infusion into the mid-esophagus and were independent of proximal esophageal acid exposure (which is a prerequisite for microaspiration) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78222\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78222 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asthma who received an infusion of acid into the esophagus had a reduction in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> dose required to decrease the forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) by 20 percent (PD20), compared with patients with asthma who received an infusion of saline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59750\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59750 \">figure 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The effect was abolished with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>. Thus, heightened bronchial reactivity may result from reflux, presumably mediated by vagal mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>A systematic review summarized the findings of 18 studies that evaluated pulmonary function during esophageal acid perfusion in adults with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. FEV<sub>1</sub>, mid-expiratory flow rate, and peak expiratory flow rate did not change significantly in 97, 94, and 65 percent of patients, respectively. Changes in airway resistance were noted in 42 percent of patients. It is difficult to reach definitive conclusions based on this review because the studies included different subsets of patients, used different techniques in acid-perfusion, and monitored different airway responses.</p><p>The occurrence of respiratory symptoms following esophageal acid exposure may be due to factors other than bronchoconstriction. As an example, esophageal acid perfusion is associated with increases in respiratory rate and minute ventilation, particularly in patients with a positive Bernstein test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This suggests that an increased minute ventilation may be responsible for worsening respiratory symptoms without a decrease in pulmonary function. However, the study was performed in subjects without asthma; whether these data can be applied to patients with asthma remains to be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Heightened bronchial reactivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal reflux may also cause neural enhancement of bronchial reactivity, as suggested by the following studies. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 105 consecutive patients with asthma, the degree of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> reactivity correlated with the number of episodes of reflux during 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In non-asthmatic patients with GE reflux symptoms, 40 percent of patients with esophagitis had positive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> bronchoprovocation tests compared with 7 percent of those without esophagitis. Six months of acid suppression therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pantoprazole</a> 40 mg daily) reduced positive methacholine test frequency to 13 percent of esophagitis patients showing that airway hyper-reactivity frequency can be reduced in non-asthmatics with esophagitis with GE reflux therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 92 asthmatics, peripheral airway and total airway resistance were significantly higher in asthmatics with GE reflux symptoms than in asthmatics without GE reflux symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Microaspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microaspiration refers to the inhalation into the lungs of tiny amounts of refluxate from the stomach. This fluid can have a low pH from acidic gastric secretions or a weakly acidic or alkaline pH when the refluxate comes from achlorhydric conditions (eg, atrophic gastritis, use of acid suppressive medication) or from the small bowel.</p><p>Esophageal acid causes bronchoconstriction by a vagally mediated reflex. This response is further augmented if microaspiration is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80770 \">figure 2</a>). Much of the evidence supporting a role for microaspiration of acid in reflux-induced bronchoconstriction comes from animal studies that found an increase in airway resistance after inhalational or intratracheal exposure to acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p>There is conflicting evidence from human studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Among 78 patients with asthma, no correlation was found between bronchoalveolar lavage pepsin levels and asthma severity. Further, no association was noted between BAL pepsin and asthma control, lung function, BAL eosinophil or neutrophil counts, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallow evidence of reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In four patients with coexisting asthma and GE reflux, pH probes were placed into the trachea and esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thirty-seven episodes of esophageal reflux lasting more than five minutes caused a mean decrease in PEF of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>. During five of these episodes, there was also a fall in tracheal pH, associated with a decrease in PEF of 84 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>.</p><p>Gastric contents that are active in a nonacidic environment can also damage the upper airway epithelium. As an example, pepsin present in gastric juice, is active even in nonacidic pH and is endocytosed by epithelial cells in the upper airways, causing tissue damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristics that may predict asthma improvement with GE reflux therapy include symptoms of regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], nocturnal asthma symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and concurrent symptoms of GE reflux and asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/24,25,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25,43,44</a>].

When interpreting pH probe data, the percentage time with the intraesophageal pH below 4 is the most useful outcome measure in discriminating between physiologic and pathologic esophageal reflux. Esophageal pH testing is accepted as the standard to diagnose GE reflux with a sensitivity of 93 percent and specificity of 95 percent. Esophageal pH testing also allows correlation of asthma symptoms with esophageal acid events. Limitations of this testing include false negatives and inability to determine the degree to which GE reflux affects a patient's asthma over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastroesophageal-reflux-and-asthma/abstract/5,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,66,67</a>].

Reciprocally, respiratory symptoms, including those associated with asthma, are increased among patients with GE reflux. Estimates of the prevalence of GE reflux among patients with asthma have varied from 30 to 90 percent. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three potential mechanisms have been proposed whereby esophageal acid may produce bronchoconstriction and therefore exacerbate airflow obstruction in asthmatics: increased vagal tone, heightened bronchial reactivity, and microaspiration of gastric contents into the upper airway. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asthma should be questioned about esophageal and extraesophageal manifestations of GE reflux (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55234\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55234 \">table 1</a>). Pertinent historical findings include asthma symptoms during an episode of GE reflux, use of an inhaler while experiencing GE reflux symptoms, or asthma symptoms after eating certain foods (eg, high fat food, chocolate, peppermint, caffeine, alcohol). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristics that may predict asthma improvement with GE reflux therapy include symptoms of regurgitation and nocturnal asthma symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with coexisting moderate to severe asthma and GE reflux symptoms, we suggest a trial of robust therapy for GE reflux (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Such therapy consists of a proton pump inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabeprazole</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pantoprazole</a>) administered twice per day for three months (taken 30 minutes before breakfast and dinner) and lifestyle measures, such as weight loss for overweight individuals and elevation of the head of the bed for those with nocturnal symptoms.

A successful trial is defined as a 20 percent improvement in peak expiratory flow rates, an improvement in asthma symptoms, or a 20 percent decrease in oral glucocorticoid dose. (See <a href=\"#H3327005023\" class=\"local\">'Improvement in asthma and GERD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatively, if the empiric therapeutic trial is unsuccessful, either asthma is not triggered by GE reflux and GE reflux therapy can be discontinued, or GE reflux was not adequately controlled. A 24-hour esophageal pH test, or combined esophageal impedance and pH test, performed with the patient on antireflux therapy, can distinguish between these possibilities. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Minimal or no improvement in asthma or GERD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proton pump inhibitor therapy is not indicated for patients with asthma and no symptoms suggestive of GE reflux. (See <a href=\"#H4242884467\" class=\"local\">'Patients without symptoms of GERD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral to a gastroenterologist is prudent if GE reflux symptoms are not controlled on twice daily proton pump inhibitor therapy or if patients report alarming symptoms including dysphagia, odynophagia, hematemesis, melena, persistent vomiting (ie, 7 to 10 days), acute involuntary weight loss, or anemia. Referral is also made for patients who are &gt;50 years old and have GE reflux symptoms for 10 or more years.
