The medical term for shin splints is &quot;medial tibial stress syndrome.&quot; Even though shin splints hurt a lot, they are not usually anything to worry about.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183854117\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of shin splints?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is pain along the front of the leg, below the knee and along the shinbone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82795 \">figure 1</a>). This pain usually starts during or after intense exercise, such as running.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183854149\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, you probably do not need to see a doctor or nurse. But if you think there is any chance you have a broken bone, do see a doctor or nurse. This is especially likely if you fell or had an injury. But some runners can get &quot;stress fractures,&quot; meaning they break a bone just by exercising or running too hard. Stress fractures feel different from shin splints in that the pain is suddenly much more intense and usually affects one specific spot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183854164\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. If you do see a doctor, he or she will probably be able to tell what is wrong by talking to you, doing an exam, and asking you to do certain things with your leg. If the doctor suspects you have a broken bone, he or she might send you for an X-ray or another imaging test. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183854179\"><span class=\"h1\">How are shin splints treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment involves:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest &ndash; If you are a runner, you should either stop running or reduce the number of miles you run until your symptoms improve or go away. While you wait, you can try another type of exercise that doesn't stress your shins, such as swimming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevation &ndash; Prop the affected leg up on pillows or a chair when you are resting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice your shin &ndash; Put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on your shin every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a pain-relieving medicine &ndash; If you need it, take an over-the-counter pain medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183854194\"><span class=\"h1\">Can shin splints be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's possible you can reduce your chances of getting shin splints by wearing shoes with extra cushioning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183854209\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shinbone-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shinbone fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Exercise (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
