They are used medically for pain relief, can be lethal in overdose, and are highly addictive. Patients can develop an opioid use disorder through misuse of pharmaceutical opioids (either prescribed or not) and through use of illicitly obtained heroin. Opioid use disorder is typically a chronic, relapsing illness, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. </p><p>Pharmacotherapy, known as medication-assisted treatment, is first-line treatment for most patients with an opioid use disorder. Psychosocial interventions are often used as adjuncts to medication. Some patients prefer abstinence-based therapy, a nonmedication treatment typically consisting of multiple psychosocial services. </p><p>This topic reviews psychosocial treatments for opioid use disorders.

Various models of continuing care for addictions emphasize that treatment for chronic or recurrent SUDs should be ongoing, not episodic, include routine monitoring during periods of abstinence as well as during exacerbation, and should adjust the intensity of treatment to the patient&rsquo;s clinical status and risk of relapse. Continuing care is particularly important for opioid use disorder, which may be more chronic than other SUDs, and often has a progressive trajectory.

Applying these findings to patients diagnosed under DSM-5 is imprecise, but the most closely comparable group of patients is those with opioid use disorder, moderate to severe subtype (ie, patients with four or more diagnostic criteria within a 12-month period). DSM-5 criteria for the diagnosis of opioid use disorder are described separately.

The treatment comparisons underlying this recommendation are described below and separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder#H19508827\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder&quot;, section on 'Treatment selection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1010945904\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication versus psychosocial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with opioid use disorder following the completion of medically supervised withdrawal, we suggest MAT augmented by psychosocial treatment first line rather than MAT alone or psychosocial treatment (so-called drug-free or abstinence-based treatment) alone. Both MAT and psychosocial treatment individually have been found to reduce substance use in clinical trials compared with control conditions, but available evidence (below) and our clinical experience suggest that MAT is more likely to maintain abstinence compared with psychosocial treatment. Psychosocial treatment alone would be a reasonable alternative in patients with mild opioid use disorder who are highly motivated to participate in treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H4236641975\" class=\"local\">'Drug-free treatment programs'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of six randomized clinical trials in patients with DSM-IV heroin dependence found that patients receiving MAT (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) had reduced opioid use as measured by <span class=\"nowrap\">urine/hair</span> analysis compared with nonpharmacologic approaches (relative risk = 0.66 95% CI 0.56-0.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Rather than structured psychosocial interventions, however, the nonpharmacologic approaches in these trials were no treatment, placebo medication, or wait-list assignment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small clinical trial with multiple methodologic limitations favored MAT. The trial randomly assigned 34 patients with heroin dependence to MAT (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) or drug-free treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. After two years, more MAT patients remained abstinent compared with patients receiving drug free treatment (71.0 versus 0.6 percent). At the end of the period, two patients assigned to drug-free treatment died and two were in prison; no deaths were reported in the MAT group.</p><p/><p>A broad consensus among opioid use disorder experts in the United States favors provision of psychosocial treatment as an adjunct to MAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4236641975\" class=\"local\">'Drug-free treatment programs'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-opioid-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical trials comparing medication treatment that includes addiction counseling versus medication treatment alone have found mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. As an example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 230 adults with opioid dependence to be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> for 12 months to additionally receive for the first four months: emergency counseling only, routine counseling, or routine counseling with smaller caseloads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At 12 months, there were no differences among groups in treatment retention (60.6 versus 54.8 and 37.8) or urine tests positive for opioids. While these studies show that retention and drug use outcomes were not appreciably affected by stepped up counseling, our clinical experience suggests that adjunctive psychosocial counseling may positively affect other aspects of patients&rsquo; well-being that are not typically measured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1354919887\"><span class=\"h2\">Selecting among psychosocial interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Efficacy trials comparing adjunctive psychosocial interventions for opioid use disorder have not been adequate to inform selection among them or the sequencing among higher intensity interventions when patients are unable to maintain abstinence with lower intensity treatment. </p><p>Information on the comparative efficacy of psychosocial interventions is limited. As an example, a clinical trial suggested that two structured interventions (acceptance and commitment [ACT] therapy and intensive 12-step facilitation) in conjunction with MAT reduced substance use compared with monthly addiction counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The trial randomly assigned 138 patients with DSM-IV opioid dependence treated with MAT (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) to additionally receive 16 weeks of ACT therapy or intensive 12-step facilitation, or monthly addiction counseling. At six-month follow-up, patients assigned to receive ACT therapy or intensive 12-step facilitation both had greater proportions of urine tests negative for any abused substance compared with patients assigned to monthly addiction counseling as part of a methadone treatment program (52 and 50 versus 32 percent). (See <a href=\"#H2044632532\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2341335373\" class=\"local\">'Twelve-step facilitation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4259376640\"><span class=\"h3\">Readiness to change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on our clinical experience in the absence of empirical data, we favor selecting, or with a treatment-nonresponsive patient, sequencing, interventions based on the Readiness to Change model. Stages of readiness to change are summarized briefly below; the model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] is reviewed in more detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Efficacy, adverse effects, and administration&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Precontemplation</strong> &ndash; Patient is not concerned about substance use and is not considering change</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contemplation</strong> &ndash; Patient has considered change or the possibility that their use may not be best for them</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Determination</strong> &ndash; Patient has decided to reduce or stop their use</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Action</strong> &ndash; Patient is reducing or stopping use</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maintenance</strong> &ndash; Patient has reduced or stopped use and is continuing on that course</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Relapse</strong> &ndash; Patient has returned to previous, unhealthy levels of use</p><p/><p>Stage of change does not reflect length of time in recovery. As examples, some patients come to treatment highly motivated and ready for action-oriented interventions. Others will need motivational interviewing at the outset before moving to a more action-oriented intervention. Some individuals who start out motivated for treatment lose motivation and return to use or start using other substances besides opioids, therefore requiring initiation of motivational interviewing. </p><p>An individual in precontemplation or contemplation stages of change should be targeted with motivational interviewing to enhance motivation to change. Contingency management can also target patients in the <span class=\"nowrap\">precontemplation/contemplation</span> stages of change, especially when contingency management targets attendance. Contingency management can enhance engagement and further a person&rsquo;s overall motivation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Motivational interviewing for substance use disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contingency management for substance use disorders: Efficacy, implementation, and training&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individuals in preparation or action stages of change would be better matched with action-orientated or skill building interventions, such as the cognitive and behavioral therapies, which leverage the desire to initiate or sustain behavior change. (See <a href=\"#H2044632532\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>Mutual help groups can be useful at point in a person&rsquo;s treatment trajectory. Individuals in action or maintenance stages of change benefit by involvement in peer-supported recovery, as they can develop a sense of &ldquo;giving back&rdquo; and mentoring those whose recovery is less stable. (See <a href=\"#H3655774166\" class=\"local\">'Mutual help groups'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H488992298\"><span class=\"h3\">Other approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For nonaddiction specialists unfamiliar with stages of change, a common approach to selecting psychosocial interventions is to begin (after completing medically supervised withdrawal) with weekly addiction counseling and participation in a mutual help group multiple times weekly. Patients unable to maintain abstinence may benefit by more frequent participation with these interventions. Mutual help groups developed specifically for concurrent use with MAT can address problems some people experience with more traditional 12-step approaches. Twelve-step facilitation may be helpful for patients who do not have specific problems with the program but lack motivation to participate. (See <a href=\"#H13095242\" class=\"local\">'Addiction counseling'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3655774166\" class=\"local\">'Mutual help groups'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2341335373\" class=\"local\">'Twelve-step facilitation'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients unable to maintain abstinence with addiction counseling and mutual help groups may benefit from the addition of contingency management to group addiction counseling or substitution of addiction counseling with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). For patients who are not motivated to participate in treatment, motivational interviewing is a reasonable alternative to CBT. Selection among these interventions may also be influenced by patient preference or treatment availability. Patients who continue opioid use or relapse while receiving one of these interventions can receive a different intervention or a combination such as contingency management and CBT. (See <a href=\"#H13095205\" class=\"local\">'Contingency management'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2044632532\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H113026780\" class=\"local\">'Motivational interviewing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13095649\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychosocial interventions for opioid use disorder include addiction counseling, mutual help groups, cognitive and behavioral therapies, contingency management, and motivational interviewing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13095242\"><span class=\"h2\">Addiction counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials do not strongly support the efficacy of addiction counseling in reducing drug use in opioid use disorder; however, our clinical experience suggests that adjunctive psychosocial counseling may positively affect other aspects of patients&rsquo; well-being that are not typically measured in clinical trials. An expert panel in the United States concluded that most patients entering medication treatment for opioid use disorder achieve optimal benefit from the combination of medication with nonpharmacologic services, including drug counseling and mutual help groups.</p><p>Addiction counseling is a broadly used term to describe individual and group therapies provided by addiction treatment programs that encourage abstinence. Programs vary widely in their content, eg, regarding specific education provided or a basis in an established therapeutic orientation.

Clinicians treating patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> are required to have the capacity to provide or refer patients to psychosocial treatment.

Participation in peer support may or may not be integrated into a person&rsquo;s formal treatment program. Mutual help groups generally focus on enabling group members to achieve and maintain abstinence from drugs such as opioids. Fellowship and spirituality are typically key components in mutual aid programs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder#H202100765\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial treatment of alcohol use disorder&quot;, section on 'Mutual help groups'</a>.) </p><p>Narcotics Anonymous (NA), like its well-established predecessor Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), involves peer-based support based on 12-step principles. NA groups occur throughout the United States and other parts of the world; such groups are considered a potentially useful part of treatment support and aftercare for individuals struggling with opioid use disorders.</p><p>Patients with opioid use disorder attending mutual help groups such as NA may encounter stigma associated with receiving medication-assisted treatment (MAT). Clinicians can help patients choose mutual self-help meetings that support the use of medication for opioid use disorder, such as Medication-Assisted Recovery Services. Clinicians should engage in discussion about stigma towards medication assisted treatment patients in mutual self-help groups. Clinician coaching is encouraged to prepare patients to achieve the benefits of participation in mutual self-help groups. Twelve-step and other mutual aid may provide a source of critical support and fellowship for patients seeking stable long-term recovery. Although official NA policy welcomes participants on MAT to join meetings, it does recommend restrictions on some of the roles those members can play (eg, leading a meeting or being a sponsor). Individual NA groups can follow any policy they choose and so some groups may be more restrictive, whereas others may be more open to members on MAT. Patients on MAT should seek the more accepting NA groups and may choose not to mention their participation in MAT at all.</p><p>Individuals with opioid use disorders can utilize specific types of mutual help groups that cater to opioid use, eg: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narcotics Anonymous</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> Anonymous</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication Assisted Recovery Services</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1982269717\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no clinical trials testing the efficacy of NA in patients with opioid use disorder. Studying NA&rsquo;s efficacy has been challenging, in part because participants are assured of anonymity. In a cohort study of 142 drug-dependent patients initiating residential treatment, the frequency of attendance at NA or AA was found to be associated with higher posttreatment abstinence rates among opioid users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]; the study could not assess the causality of the relationship. A survey of 332 patients enrolled in MAT for opioid use disorder and participating in NA found that more than three-quarters of patients reported that NA was &ldquo;very&rdquo; or &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; helpful to them. People with opioid addictions can and do attend AA; some find AA provides more structure and has a stronger spiritual base than NA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. &#160;</p><p>While individuals enrolled in opioid treatment programs have been shown to attend 12-step meetings, they may not engage in the full range of potentially helpful components of NA, such as sponsorship, attending 12-step activities, or active step work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Enrollees in medication assisted treatment (ie, with an opioid agonist) have reported feeling stigmatized within the 12-step community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], in part due to the perceived or real lack of acceptance other among group members who do not use medication in the treatment of their substance use disorder (SUD). </p><p>Alternative approaches to mutual help for this population, eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methadone</a> Anonymous and Medication Assisted Recovery Services, provide an environment similar to 12-step programs that additionally capitalizes on the shared experience of individuals engaged in medication assisted treatment.

As examples, CBT can help people develop an awareness of their cognitive distortions that negative impact a person&rsquo;s mood and likelihood of relapse. CBT therapies focus on identification of these aforementioned domains and development of skills to modify or accept the behaviors.

There is a large and robust body of research that has tested contingency management for SUD, with a variety of reinforcement schedules, contingency types, and other variations. The majority of the studies testing contingency management use 12 weeks of weekly contingency management as a standard for treatment.

Two types of trial designs were included: comparisons between MAT with contingency management and MAT with control conditions, and comparison before and after the addition of contingency management. Over the course of treatment patients participating in contingency management were less likely to have positive urine tests. A limitation of the study was the inclusion of trials lacking randomized controls. </p><p>Clinical trials of contingency management and MAT for opioid use disorder have reported improvements in attendance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>], medication compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>], and drug abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Principles of motivational interviewing include expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Other tenets of motivational interviewing include accurate empathy, a nonjudgmental stance, the use of reflections and open-ended questions are foundational in building rapport and collaboratively working towards change. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders#H9274950\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Motivational interviewing for substance use disorders&quot;, section on 'Practice'</a>.)</p><p>Motivational interviewing can be brief (one to four sessions). Instead of a prescribed number or frequency of sessions, motivational interviewing is best applied when an identified behavior (eg, substance use) is identified for change. Several features of patients with opioid use disorder are well suited to motivational interviewing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioid addiction is typically a chronic and progressive disease, characterized by cycles of abstinence and relapse. These cycles often reflect vacillations in patients&rsquo; levels of motivation to <span class=\"nowrap\">change/maintain</span> change. Clinicians benefit their patients by understanding the ebb and flow of motivation. In times of active drug use, clinicians skilled in motivational interviewing can nonjudgmentally redirect patients towards contemplating change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioid use disorder patients receiving MAT in an opioid treatment program can have therapeutic relationships lasting years or decades. During a lengthy course of treatment, opioid use disorder-specific problems may stabilize, leaving open the opportunity for clinicians to apply motivational interviewing towards other behaviors, for example, polysubstance use, smoking cessation, or seeking appropriate medical care for the plethora of health-related concerns that arise from years of drug use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motivational interviewing can be easily integrated into the various settings and modalities involved in opioid use disorder and can be used by the diverse types of providers (eg, counselors, clinicians, nurses). As an example, motivational interviewing is a component of behavioral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a> treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2583254161\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Motivational interviewing has been found to be efficacious in SUD generally; evidence in opioid use disorder is positive but more limited. A 2011 meta-analysis of 59 randomized trials with a total of 13,342 adult participants with DSM-IV substance abuse or dependence found that, compared with no treatment, motivational interviewing resulted in a significant reduction in substance use postintervention (standardized mean difference = 0.79, 95% CI 0.48-1.09) and at subsequent follow-up for as long as 12 months (standardized mean difference = 0.15, 95% CI 0.04-0.25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-opioid-use-disorder/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].
