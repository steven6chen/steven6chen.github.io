However, it is challenging to define normal neonatal BP as there is a lack of normative BP in this age group. In addition, there are a number of factors that affect normal BP values during the neonatal period (defined as the first 28 days of life). As a result, it has been difficult to develop a standardized definition of hypertension for clinical use in this age group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915543\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal BP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is challenging to establish normative values for neonatal BP, especially in preterm infants, because of the effects of gestational age and maturation on BP values. BP values increase following birth, with greater rates of increase seen in preterm infants compared with term infants (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants#H3206285792\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of low blood pressure in extremely preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Physiological changes in BP'</a>). In addition, the lack of large scale, prospective, multicenter studies of neonatal BP, further complicates the problem of defining normative BP data for neonates, especially preterm and ill term infants.</p><p>Nevertheless, based on a review of these data, a reference table of normal BP values at or after two weeks of age in infants between 26 and 44 weeks postconceptional age has been published (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76354\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76354 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This table, which is based on the best available data through 2010, can be used clinically to identify infants with hypertension, defined as persistent BP elevation greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile.

In this cohort, BP on day one of life correlated with gestational age and birth weight. In all infants regardless of gestational age, BP increased at a faster rate over the first week of life, followed by subsequent slowing. The rate of rise was more rapid in preterm infants compared with term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In a study of 367 extremely preterm infants (gestational age between 23 and &lt;27 weeks), arterial blood pressure initially decreased within the first three hours of life and then spontaneously increased over the first 24 hours of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The average rise of mean BP was 0.2 mmHg per hour and did not differ between untreated infants and those who received antihypotensive therapy (eg, fluid bolus or drug therapy). Although there was a wide range of BP values, the mean systolic, diastolic, and mean BP increased with increasing gestational age similarly to observations noted in studies of more mature infants.</p><p>Healthy term infants cared for in the normal nursery demonstrate a somewhat different pattern from the above studies. This was illustrated in an Australian prospective study of 406 term infants with a mean gestational age of 40 weeks born between 2003 and 2005, in whom blood pressure measurements were determined by oscillometric methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 12 to 24 hours of life, median systolic, diastolic, and mean BPs were 65 (range 46 to 94), 45 (range 24 to 57), and 48 (range 31 to 63), respectively. Unlike what was seen in the studies of preterm infants, no difference in BP was seen on day one of life based on birth weight, length, or gestational age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood pressure measurements increased over the next four successive days by 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmHg/day</span>. On days two, three, and four of life, median systolic BP measurements were 68, 69.5, and 70, respectively; median diastolic BPs were 43, 44.5, and 46, respectively; and median mean BPs were 51, 52, and 54, respectively. The differences between days three and four were not significant, suggesting an earlier leveling off of BP than that observed in preterm infants.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915550\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of neonatal hypertension varies depending upon the clinical setting. In otherwise healthy term infants, hypertension is exceedingly uncommon with a reported rate of 0.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the incidence is higher with reported rates ranging from 0.7 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. Risk factors for hypertension in patients admitted to the NICU include low gestational age and birth weight, specific diseases (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD], cardiac disease, and renal injury), use of umbilical artery catheters, and increasing severity of illness.</p><p>In an analysis of data from Pediatric Health Information System of 123,847 infants discharged from NICUs between 2005 and 2009, 1.7 percent had a diagnosis of hypertension encoded at the time of discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After patients with cardiac disease were omitted, 1 percent of patients (n = 764) were diagnosed with hypertension of the remaining 78,986 patients cared for at 36 different institutions. In a multivariate analysis of these hypertensive patients without cardiac disease, risk factors for hypertension included low birth weight, renal disease or failure, neonatal abstinence syndrome, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and increasing severity of illness.</p><p>In a retrospective Australian study of 2572 newborn infants born between 2001 and 2005, and admitted to the NICU, 1.3 percent of infants were diagnosed with hypertension (defined as systolic or mean blood pressure [BP] &gt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age) at a median postnatal age of five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Hypertensive infants were more likely to have a lower gestational age, birth weight, and length than normotensive infants. Other factors associated with hypertension included antenatal steroid administration, maternal hypertension, umbilical arterial catheterization, postnatal acute renal injury, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and BPD.</p><p>In a retrospective single center review of 4203 neonates admitted to the NICU from 2006 to 2009, 53 patients (1.3 percent) had persistent hypertension that was treated with antihypertensive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Logistic regression analysis identified BPD and PDA as risk factors for hypertension. Other common features of hypertensive infants included use of umbilical catheters and the presence of systemic diseases such as renal disease.</p><p>Hypertension is also reported after NICU discharge. In a study of 654 infants seen in a neonatal follow-up clinic, 17 (2.6 percent) were found to have hypertension (defined as systolic BP &gt;113 mmHg by Doppler) at a mean postconceptional age of 49 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Compared with a control group of 212 normotensive infants, the hypertensive infants tended to have lower birth weights, lower one minute Apgar scores, and longer lengths of stay in the NICU, but none of the differences were statistically significant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915557\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASUREMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comparison of an infant's blood pressure (BP) to normative values requires proper measurement. BP can be measured invasively or noninvasively. The ideal setting to measure BP is while the infant is sleeping or resting, because crying, pain, feeding, and agitation all can increase BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915564\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraarterial measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct intraarterial measurement through a catheter placed in the aorta or the radial artery is the most accurate technique. It also provides continuous readings. The degree to which radial pressures correlate with aortic pressures is uncertain. In adults, radial artery systolic BP measurements may be 20 to 30 percent higher than central values, although mean and diastolic measurements are comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, radial pressures appear to more closely mimic aortic pressures in newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Complications associated with intraarterial catheters include thrombosis and infection. Thus, they should be used to monitor BP only when the catheter is needed for a significant clinical indication, such as frequent blood sampling, hypotension requiring pressor support, or severe hypertension requiring treatment with intravenous antihypertensives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915571\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninvasive measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous noninvasive devices are available to measure blood pressure. The most common technique is oscillometry, which permits continuous measurement of blood pressure and correlates well with direct measurements. Automated oscillometric devices measure the mean arterial pressure and calculate the systolic and diastolic pressures. The algorithms used for these calculations vary between manufacturers, so different devices may give different BP values in the same patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915578\"><span class=\"h3\">Cuff size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A critical component of noninvasive blood pressure measurement is use of an appropriate sized cuff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The cuff bladder should measure two-thirds the length of the extremity, and 0.44 to 0.55 of the arm circumference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103066\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103066 \">figure 4</a>). If the choice is between a cuff that is too small or one that is too large, use of the larger cuff will result in less error. Most normal blood pressure values are derived from upper arm measurements. Thus, BP usually is measured in an arm. In the term infant with a maximum arm circumference of 10 cm, the usual dimensions of an appropriate sized cuff bladder are 4 cm in width and 8 cm in length &#160;</p><p>If a leg is used, an appropriate sized cuff should be selected, that is, one that is two-thirds the length of the extremity. With appropriate sized cuffs, lower- and upper-extremity BPs are nearly identical in the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The medical record should note the site of measurement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112801316\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For noncritically ill infants in whom hypertension is suspected, we use the following standard protocol to measure BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BP measured by oscillometric device</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BP measurement preferentially performed 1.5 hours after a feed or medical intervention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infant lying in a prone or supine position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of an appropriate sized BP cuff</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BP measurement performed in the right upper arm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After cuff placement, the blood pressure should be measured several minutes after the infant has settled into a calm state</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BP measurement performed while the infant is asleep or in quiet awake state</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an automated BP device is used, the first reading is typically discarded</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915585\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although numerous causes have been identified, the most common causes of neonatal hypertension are umbilical artery catheter-associated thromboembolism, chronic lung disease, and renal parenchymal disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51246 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, sometimes no specific underlying cause is identified. This was illustrated in a multicenter case series from the United States that reported an inability to determine the etiology in approximately 50 percent of hypertensive infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In patients with no identified cause, hypertension may be due to the presence of an undetectable renovascular event.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915592\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112801428\"><span class=\"h3\">UAC-associated thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common renovascular abnormality associated with neonatal hypertension is thrombosis associated with umbilical artery catheter (UAC) placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Thrombi that form on the tip or surface of the catheter can partially or completely occlude the abdominal aorta, thereby decreasing renal perfusion.

At follow-up at a mean age of 5.75 years, scans remained abnormal, and five patients had unilateral renal atrophy.</p><p/><p>The risk of UAC-associated thrombosis increases with increasing duration of UAC use, high UAC placement (ie, catheter above the diaphragm versus low placement, just above the aortic bifurcation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], the lack of use of heparinized infusate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and trauma to the endothelial surface while the catheter is in situ or during catheter insertion.

(See <a href=\"#H2915536\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of neonatal hypertension varies depending upon the clinical setting. It is uncommon in healthy term infants, with a reported incidence of 0.2 percent. The incidence is higher in infants who are admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (0.7 to 3 percent), especially in very preterm ill infants who are more likely to have risk factors for hypertension (eg, umbilical arterial catheter [UAC] placement and bronchopulmonary dysplasia [BPD]). (See <a href=\"#H2915550\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BP can be measured either directly through intraarterial measurement or noninvasively. Each center that cares for neonates should establish a standard approach for obtaining BP to ensure accuracy and consistency. In our center, we obtain BP measurements while the infant is either asleep or in a quiet state, and in a prone or supine lying position. For noncritically ill infants, BP is measured by an oscillometric device after an appropriate sized BP cuff is positioned on the right upper arm and preferably 1.5 hours after a feed or medical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H2915557\" class=\"local\">'Measurement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are numerous causes of neonatal hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51246 \">table 2</a>). The most common etiology is umbilical artery catheter-associated thromboembolism, followed by chronic lung disease and renal parenchymal disease. (See <a href=\"#H2915585\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most hypertensive newborns are asymptomatic. In those who are symptomatic, the magnitude of hypertension may not correlate with its presence or severity. Hypertension may be manifested by cardiorespiratory, neurologic, and renal symptoms, and nonspecific signs such as lethargy, poor feeding, apnea, and irritability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78185 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2915662\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hypertension is confirmed by repeated accurate measurements that demonstrate either systolic or diastolic BP that persistently exceeds the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for postconceptional age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62005\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62005 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76354\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76354 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2915669\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the diagnosis of neonatal hypertension is confirmed, an evaluation is performed to identify the underlying cause of hypertension, which may potentially be corrected. This assessment includes a focused history, followed by physical examination and selected laboratory testing and imaging studies.
