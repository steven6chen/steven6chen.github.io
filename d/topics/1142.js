Routine use of episiotomy has fallen out of favor based on evidence of increased complications with use. Episiotomy is now performed on an individualized basis. Episiotomy is considered when the clinical circumstances place the patient at high risk of a third or fourth degree laceration or when the fetal heart tracing is of concern and hastening vaginal delivery is warranted. Mediolateral episiotomy is associated with a lower risk of third and fourth degree laceration than a median episiotomy.</p><p>This topic will review the indications, risks, benefits, and procedure for episiotomy.

The incision is performed with scissors or scalpel and is typically midline (median) or mediolateral in location. (See <a href=\"#H2717687518\" class=\"local\">'Procedures and selection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3439382938\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the 1996 World Health Organization recommendation for an episiotomy rate of approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], rates of episiotomy have generally been in decline. In the United States, the episiotomy rate dropped from 17.3 to 11.6 percent from 2006 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In a study from a United States insurance database, demographic characteristics associated with receipt of episiotomy included white race and commercial insurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Hospital factors including rural location or academic center were associated with reduced rates of episiotomy. Other studies have reported that private practitioners have two- to fourfold increased utilization of episiotomies compared with trainees, academic faculty, or midwives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1983805044\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANTAGES OF RESTRICTED USE OF EPISIOTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine use of episiotomy is no longer recommended because of insufficient objective evidence-based data demonstrating benefit or defining the criterion for its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In addition, restricted use of episiotomy decreases the risk of severe (ie, third and fourth degree) obstetric lacerations. In a meta-analysis of 12 trials comparing restrictive episiotomy use with routine use in women expecting an unassisted vaginal birth, restrictive episiotomy resulted in up to 30 percent fewer women sustaining severe perineal or vaginal trauma (risk ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94, 5375 women, eight trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There were no differences between the groups in postpartum day 3 perineal pain, long-term (six months or more) dyspareunia, urinary incontinence, or genital prolapse. </p><p>In the past, routine use of episiotomy was believed to have several benefits; however, the body of evidence does not support these beliefs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction of trauma to the fetal head &ndash; Although episiotomy has been advocated to minimize the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm births, there is no evidence that this intervention is effective on a routine basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ease of repair and improved wound healing &ndash; It has been historically argued that a controlled surgical incision is easier to repair and more likely to be anatomically correct than repair of a spontaneous laceration, and thus less likely to result in long-term complications. In the absence of episiotomy extension, episiotomy incision is easier to repair than most jagged spontaneous deep second degree lacerations. However, data demonstrating improved long-term outcomes with episiotomy are lacking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repair-of-perineal-and-other-lacerations-associated-with-childbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repair of perineal and other lacerations associated with childbirth&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preservation of the muscular and fascial support of the pelvic floor &ndash; Episiotomy also does not protect pelvic floor strength and may result in a weakened pelvic floor musculature when compared with spontaneous laceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. In addition, neither midline nor mediolateral episiotomies are protective against future urinary or fecal incontinence when compared with spontaneous vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of anal sphincter laceration &ndash; There is increasing consensus that the median episiotomy is not effective for this purpose, and in fact has been associated with increased rate of severe perineal lacerations. In a meta-analysis of 22 observational studies that included over 651,000 women (2.4 percent with severe lacerations), median episiotomy was associated with a nearly fourfold increased risk of third- or fourth-degree perineal lacerations (odd ratio [OR] 3.82, 95% CI 1.96-7.42) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Of note, mediolateral episiotomy did not increase the risk of severe perineal laceration (OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.81-3.65). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence#H9411000\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of pregnancy and childbirth on anal sphincter function and fecal incontinence&quot;, section on 'Median episiotomy'</a>.).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of shoulder dystocia &ndash; In a systematic review of 14 studies including over 9700 cases of shoulder dystocia, only one study evaluated the effect of episiotomy on prevention of shoulder dystocia, and the result was not significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While episiotomy does not appear to prevent shoulder dystocia, its use in the management of shoulder dystocia is less clear.

There are no specific situations in which episiotomy is essential. It is a reasonable option when the clinician believes enlarging the birth outlet to facilitate delivery of the fetus will benefit the mother or baby and warrants maternal exposure to the potential adverse outcomes associated with the procedure. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expedite delivery of the fetus &ndash; Episiotomy can be helpful in situations where expedited delivery of the fetus is desired during the second stage of labor, such as with a category III fetal heart rate tracing that does not respond to resuscitative measures. Episiotomy is only helpful if delivery is being blocked by perineal tissue (ie, episiotomy will not improve maternal expulsive efforts). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-intrapartum-category-i-ii-and-iii-fetal-heart-rate-tracings#H11183979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of intrapartum category I, II, and III fetal heart rate tracings&quot;, section on 'Category III tracings: definition and management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative vaginal delivery &ndash; Episiotomy can be used to facilitate placement of the forceps or vacuum extractor in women with a narrow vaginal outlet. In contrast to historical recommendations, multiple societies advise against routine episiotomy with operative vaginal delivery; the decision to perform an episiotomy during an operative vaginal delivery is at the discretion of the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/6,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22-26</a>]. As median episiotomy during an operative vaginal delivery triples the risk of an anal sphincter injury compared with operative vaginal delivery alone, median episiotomy is not advised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When episiotomy is performed, mediolateral episiotomy is associated with a lower risk of anal sphincter injury compared with median episiotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 studies comparing mediolateral or lateral episiotomy with no episiotomy in primiparous women undergoing vacuum assisted delivery, mediolateral or lateral episiotomy was associated with an approximately 50 percent reduction in risk of anal sphincter laceration compared with no episiotomy (odds ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.37-0.77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Based on this study, 19 women would have to undergo mediolateral or lateral episiotomy during vacuum extraction to prevent one anal sphincter laceration. For clinicians who elect to perform an episiotomy to facilitate delivery, we advise a mediolateral or lateral incision. We evaluate all nulliparous women undergoing operative vaginal delivery for possible episiotomy and are likely to perform a mediolateral or lateral episiotomy in women with a short perineum. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of note, operative vaginal delivery is an independent risk factor for advanced perineal laceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-pregnancy-and-childbirth-on-anal-sphincter-function-and-fecal-incontinence#H928416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of pregnancy and childbirth on anal sphincter function and fecal incontinence&quot;, section on 'Operative vaginal delivery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoulder dystocia &ndash; In some cases of shoulder dystocia, performing an episiotomy can increase space for the operator's fingers and thus facilitate delivery of the posterior shoulder and other internal procedures, but does not appear to prevent shoulder dystocia or release the impacted anterior shoulder. Routine use of episiotomy to manage shoulder dystocia is not advised until more data from randomly assigned trials are available to determine the balance of benefit or harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Episiotomy does not prevent shoulder dystocia. A systematic review of 14 studies evaluating episiotomy at the time of shoulder dystocia reported conflicting results for neonatal and maternal outcomes when shoulder dystocia was managed with episiotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In the review, conclusions regarding the role of episiotomy in the management of shoulder dystocia were further limited because the original studies did not routinely adjust for potential confounders (eg, macrosomia, parity, operative vaginal delivery, and non-random study design). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder dystocia: Intrapartum diagnosis, management, and outcome&quot;, section on 'Initial steps'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2717687518\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURES AND SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common types of episiotomy are the median (midline) and mediolateral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70476\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70476 \">figure 1</a>). Other less common incisions include the J type and T shape. The decision to perform an episiotomy is a clinical judgement, and routine use of episiotomy is not advised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2844190194\"><span class=\"h2\">Mediolateral versus median (midline) episiotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When performing episiotomy, our preference is a mediolateral episiotomy because of the reduction in anal sphincter laceration (ie, third or fourth degree obstetric injury) with mediolateral episiotomy compared with median episiotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/17,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,30</a>]. In attempt to limit anal sphincter laceration, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists advises mediolateral incisions when episiotomy is performed, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that mediolateral episiotomy may be preferable to median episiotomy in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/24,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,31</a>].</p><p>The selection of median versus mediolateral episiotomy balances the differing risks of the two procedures. Median episiotomy is associated with a higher risk of anal sphincter laceration than mediolateral episiotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Mediolateral episiotomy is associated with increased blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In addition, mediolateral episiotomy has historically been thought to result in more perineal pain and dyspareunia. However, while there are conflicting data, the balance of evidence suggests that there are no differences in pain outcomes between the two procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. One study reported greater pain in women with a mediolateral episiotomy incised 60 degrees off the midline compared with women whose episiotomy was cut 40 degrees off of midline, which could partly contribute to the differing study outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Of note, anal sphincter injury itself has been associated with increased perineal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1778604380\"><span class=\"h2\">Median (midline)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The median episiotomy starts within 3 mm of the midline of the posterior fourchette and extends downwards between 0 and 25 degrees of the sagittal plane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The mediolateral episiotomy is more commonly used in Europe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492994401\"><span class=\"h2\">J incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The J incision is less widely used. The incision starts at the fourchette, is initially extended caudally in the midline, and then curved laterally at an angle, similar to the letter J. The anatomical structures incised include the vaginal epithelium, perineal body, and the junction of the perineal body with the bulbocavernosus muscle and perineal skin. Ideally, the transverse perineal muscle is spared because the lateral part of the incision should be below this muscle; however, it is difficult to ensure that it is not incised.</p><p>This hybrid of median and mediolateral episiotomies may theoretically optimize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages of the individual techniques. For example, the apex of the incision points away from the rectum to guide any further extension away from this structure. However, there are no data on which to base conclusions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4119304727\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are various modifications of the above techniques that may be preferred by individual practitioners (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70476\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70476 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T episiotomy &ndash; The T episiotomy is a modification of the median episiotomy in which bilateral transverse incisions are made at the inferior apex to create an inverted T-shaped incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This procedure increases the area of the vaginal opening more than a median episiotomy alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78159\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78159 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateral episiotomy &ndash; The lateral episiotomy is begun at 1 to 2 cm lateral to midline, and the incision is directed laterally toward the ischial tuberosity.

It is only indicated in the setting of previous female circumcision (ie, female genital mutilation). The fused labia minora are incised in the midline toward the pubis to reveal the external urethral meatus; the clitoral remnants should not be incised.

Sometimes a doctor or midwife will cut some tissue to make the opening bigger (episiotomy). Most women with tears or an episiotomy will need stitches. The stitches will dissolve during healing.

Rarely, continued problems with bowel movements may occur.</p><p/><p>In addition to antenatal education, we verbally consent the patient before performing an episiotomy.

The optimal time for cutting the episiotomy is not known. In a prospective cohort study that compared episiotomy prior to crowning with episiotomy performed at crowning, episiotomy performed prior to crowning was associated with increased vaginal trauma, longer mean episiotomy length, and greater mean estimated blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3341109143\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to performing an episiotomy, the clinician will typically place one or two fingers inside the posterior vaginal wall to protect the fetal scalp during incision.

The goal is to release any restriction imposed by the perineal body, which can sometimes be felt as a band of tissue cephalad and inferior to the vaginal orifice. The incision is directed internally to minimize the amount of perineal skin incised. The length of the incision is determined by patient anatomy and perceived need. As the general goal of episiotomy is to facilitate delivery of the fetal head, the incision is made long enough to expedite that process but avoid the rectum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The anatomical structures involved in the incision include the vaginal epithelium, perineal body, and the junction of the perineal body with the bulbocavernosus muscle in the perineum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mediolateral episiotomy</strong> &ndash; For a mediolateral incision, the incision is made at the vaginal introitus in a lateral direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70476\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70476 \">figure 1</a>). The incision is initiated at the fourchette and cut at an angle (usually to the maternal right for right handed clinicians) that may be almost perpendicular to the midline (80 to 90 degrees as the fetal head is crowning); however, after delivery of the infant, this angle becomes smaller, approaching 45 degrees, since the perineum is no longer stretched and distorted by the fetal presenting part. The final angle of the incision should be at 30 to 60 degrees from the midline to minimize the occurrence of sphincter injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. The incision is usually between 3 and 5 cm in length.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The anatomical structures incised include the vaginal epithelium, transverse perineal and bulbocavernosus muscles, and perineal skin. If the incision is large, adipose tissue within ischiorectal fossa may be exposed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2711285326\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery and repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During delivery of the fetal head, support of the perineum at the most interior aspect of the incision may help reduce extensions.

Repair of obstetric lacerations and episiotomy incisions is presented separately.

Although vulvovaginal hematomas can occur after episiotomies, this complication is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective, non-randomly assigned, observational study reported that episiotomy was associated with a 3 cm longer perineal laceration compared with no episiotomy (ie, spontaneous laceration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Eighty percent of the episiotomies were midline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 22 studies, midline episiotomy was associated with nearly four times the risk of obstetric anal sphincter injuries (odds ratio 3.82, 95% CI 1.96-7.42) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Data are less clear for mediolateral episiotomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition to the risk of anal incontinence, obstetric anal sphincter injuries have been associated with postponed coital onset and dyspareunia one year postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control study of over 104,000 deliveries reported an incidence of 0.1 perineal laceration breakdowns per delivery (all vaginal deliveries were included) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In a review of over 6000 deliveries that compared women with episiotomy at first delivery versus those without, women with prior episiotomy had a greater number of severe perineal lacerations (4.8 versus 1.7 percent) and more second degree lacerations (51.3 versus 26.7 percent) at the time of subsequent delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-episiotomy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Logistic regression modeling predicted a fivefold increased risk of anal sphincter complex lacerations for women with prior episiotomy (odds ratio 5.25, 95% CI 2.96-9.32). Although the type of episiotomy was not identified in this study, the majority of episiotomies were likely median incisions as these are most common in the United States, where the study was performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1319385492\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The purpose is to widen the birth outlet and facilitate vaginal delivery. (See <a href=\"#H1701129412\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing vaginal delivery, we recommend <strong>against</strong> routine episiotomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Routine episiotomy is associated with higher rates of severe perineal trauma and wound complications compared with restricted use of episiotomy. The decision to perform episiotomy is made on a case-by-case, or restricted, basis rather than performing the procedure routinely. (See <a href=\"#H1983805044\" class=\"local\">'Advantages of restricted use of episiotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episiotomy may be helpful in some clinical settings. The decision to perform episiotomy is heavily dependent on the opinion of the delivering clinician and is based on the clinical scenario at the time of delivery. There are no specific situations in which episiotomy is essential. Situations in which episiotomy can be helpful include the need for expedited vaginal delivery, operative vaginal delivery, and shoulder dystocia. (See <a href=\"#H1858921831\" class=\"local\">'When to consider episiotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When an episiotomy is to be performed, we suggest a mediolateral episiotomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Mediolateral episiotomy reduces the risk of anal sphincter laceration (ie, third or fourth degree obstetric injury) compared with median episiotomy. (See <a href=\"#H2844190194\" class=\"local\">'Mediolateral versus median (midline) episiotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the decision is made to perform an episiotomy, patient consent is obtained, adequate anesthesia is provided, and the fetal scalp is protected by the clinician prior to incision. (See <a href=\"#H1269352209\" class=\"local\">'Performing episiotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For a median episiotomy, the perineum is incised vertically within 3 mm of the midline, or 6 o'clock position, on the introitus. (See <a href=\"#H3341109143\" class=\"local\">'Procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For a mediolateral episiotomy, the incision is made at the vaginal introitus in a lateral direction. (See <a href=\"#H3341109143\" class=\"local\">'Procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common complications of episiotomy include extension of the incision into the perineum or anal sphincter complex, infection, postpartum pain, and dyspareunia.
