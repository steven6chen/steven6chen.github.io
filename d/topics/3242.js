Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative fever, endometritis, wound infection, urinary tract infection, and serious maternal infectious complications compared with controls receiving no antibiotic treatment. The relative risk of endometritis was reduced by approximately 60 percent after scheduled cesarean delivery, intrapartum cesarean delivery, and for all patients (relative risk [RR] = 0.38, 0.39, and 0.37, respectively). None of the trials reported on short- and long-term adverse effects in offspring, such as bacterial resistance, oral thrush, or effects on immune system development. A subsequent analysis found no increase in neonatal sepsis (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.51-1.13, five trials, n = 2907) or infection with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.32-4.14, one trial, n = 379), but more data are needed to confirm these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Although the relative risk reduction in maternal infection is statistically significant and similar for both scheduled and in labor procedures, the absolute risk of maternal infection is quite low in scheduled cases: postpartum endometritis 2 percent with antibiotic prophylaxis versus 2.6 percent without antibiotic prophylaxis; wound infection 0.52 percent with antibiotic prophylaxis versus 0.96 percent without antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Thus, 1000 women undergoing scheduled cesarean would receive antibiotics to prevent 6 cases of endometritis and 4.4 cases of abdominal wound infection. The low risk of maternal infection in these cases and uncertainty about long-term effects in offspring have prompted a call for more research on potential long-term risks of exposure to antibiotic prophylaxis and strategies for risk stratification to identify the best candidates for antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Until these data available, we administer antibiotics before all cesarean deliveries, in accordance with ACOG guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Antimicrobial therapy should be administered within 60 minutes before making the skin incision to ensure adequate drug tissue levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This recommendation is supported by a 2014 meta-analysis of randomized trials that compared infection rates in women assigned to a single pre-incision dose of antibiotic prophylaxis versus those assigned to administration after cord clamping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Pre-incision prophylaxis was significantly more effective than delayed administration for prevention of endometritis (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.79) and was not associated with an increase in proven neonatal sepsis, sepsis work-ups, or admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, although the trials had limited power to detect adverse neonatal effects.

A wide variety of conditions fulfill these criteria. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scheduled primary cesarean delivery at term should be performed in the 39<sup>th</sup> or 40<sup>th</sup> week of gestation, rather than in the 37<sup>th</sup> or 38<sup>th</sup> week. <span class=\"nowrap\">Medically/obstetrically</span> indicated cesarean deliveries are performed when clinically indicated. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Scheduling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing of elective repeat cesarean delivery is based on the type of previous hysterotomy incision, and is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=repeat-cesarean-delivery#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Repeat cesarean delivery&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all women undergoing cesarean delivery, we recommend preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis rather than no prophylaxis or prophylaxis after cord clamping (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Antibiotics are given up to 60 minutes before making the incision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We use a single intravenous dose of a narrow-spectrum antibiotic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> (2 grams for patients &lt;120 kg and 3 grams for patients &ge;120 kg) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 2</a>). Multiple doses are more costly, without clearly improving outcome.

For patients at low risk of a serious immediate allergic reaction, a cephalosporin can be administered instead of combination therapy.

Some clinicians administer a single dose of a narrow-spectrum antibiotic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Choice of antibiotics in woman already on antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> for chorioamnionitis, we add either one dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> 900 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> 500 mg, and continue ampicillin and gentamicin or switch to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-and-sulbactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin-sulbactam</a> postpartum until the patient is afebrile for at least 24 hours. <em>Bacteroides</em> resistance to clindamycin is increasing; in areas of high resistance, ampicillin-sulbactam is preferable.

Because of limitations in available data, we continue to use narrow-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis for all patients; however, others may reasonably choose to use an extended regimen in high-risk patients.

Chlorhexidine-alcohol solutions should be allowed to dry for at least three minutes before using an ignition source, otherwise a nonflammable preparation (povidone-iodine or&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> soap) should be used. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Skin preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women in labor and women with ruptured membranes, we suggest vaginal cleansing before cesarean delivery rather than no vaginal cleansing (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We use a povidone-iodine vaginal scrub for 30 seconds. Vaginal cleansing in these high risk populations reduces the frequency of postpartum endometritis.

For women undergoing cesarean delivery at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), we suggest mechanical thromboprophylaxis plus pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Pharmacologic prophylaxis is begun 6 to 12 hours postoperatively, after concerns for hemorrhage have decreased. Mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis are continued until the woman is fully ambulating. Women with significant risk factors for VTE persisting following delivery should receive a full six weeks of thromboprophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolism prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During cesarean delivery, the uterus is displaced at least 15 degrees to the left to reduce aortocaval compression.
