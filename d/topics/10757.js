The molecular defects underlying many of these disorders are now understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Each year, new disorders are identified, and milder variants of known PIDs are recognized in patients surviving into adolescence and adulthood. A number of new medical therapies have provided dramatic improvements in life expectancy and quality of life for immunodeficient individuals, and their care is becoming increasingly complex.</p><p>The management of patients with PID begins with early identification and diagnosis. Families with affected children require counseling about the risk of the same disorder occurring in future children. If an affected pregnancy is identified, measures to prevent infection and plan for curative therapies begin at birth. Affected adults may seek information about family planning.

Many immunodeficiencies that present in early infancy are potentially life-threatening. In addition, routine interventions, especially administration of live vaccines or untreated blood products, can result in devastating complications. The immediate management of a neonate who may have immunodeficiency, including isolation to prevent infection and safe vaccination and feeding, is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-of-immunodeficiency-in-the-newborn-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition of immunodeficiency in the newborn period&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For older children and adults with suspected immune disorders, an immunologist should also be consulted, whenever possible, to assist with diagnosis and ongoing care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

This applies mainly to severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCID) and other forms of immunodeficiency where T cell function may be severely compromised (eg, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, X-linked hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome, nuclear factor [NF]-kappa-B essential modifier (NEMO) deficiency, and complete DiGeorge syndrome [and others]). Any cellular blood products given to these patients must be leukoreduced or irradiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Immunodeficient states'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>Blood products should also be tested for cytomegalovirus (CMV), a virus that can cause significant disease in immunocompromised individuals who have an underlying T cell defect or have undergone transplantation.

This is important for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients often require lifetime therapy (eg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, repeated courses of antimicrobials, other biologics), which confer some risk to the patient and considerable expense.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States and some other countries, documentation is required for reimbursement of costly therapies by insurers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PID may impact future employment, military service, family planning, and insurability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may be candidates for genetic counseling either to assist parents of infants in planning for future childbearing or for older patients planning their own families. (See <a href=\"#H809452165\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Patients who are referred to immunology experts for care should have any previous diagnoses re-evaluated to assure that the correct diagnosis has been assigned. In some older patients, more accurate molecular diagnostic testing will have become available since the original diagnosis was made. In other cases, the diagnosis may be incorrect and therapies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>) may need to be discontinued so that testing can be repeated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2253771881\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTION PREVENTION AND TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevention of infections in patients with PID involves avoidance measures, vaccination, prophylactic antibiotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> therapy, and sometimes specialized immune globulins. When infections do occur, broader spectrum and more prolonged antibiotics are often required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the goals of medical therapy is to optimize the individual's function and integration into society. Children and adults with mild forms of immunodeficiency should be encouraged to participate in all usual activities. Normal school attendance should be the goal for children with immunodeficiency, although some experts advise against the placement of infants and young children in large institutional day care settings where there is a well-documented higher rate of infectious illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Concern about infections also applies to adults in whom placement in institutional settings is a consideration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There are several routine measures patients and families can take to reduce exposure to others with potentially contagious illnesses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Instructions in proper handwashing and use of alcohol-based disinfectants should be provided to patients and their families (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-prevention-precautions-for-preventing-transmission-of-infection#H2557723252\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection prevention: Precautions for preventing transmission of infection&quot;, section on 'Hand hygiene'</a>). Patient information is available in topics about avoidance of the common cold. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: The common cold in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Co-sleeping among family members should be minimized, and immunization of family members and close contacts (against influenza, for example) is encouraged. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in patients with primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful attention should be paid to patient's oral hygiene and dental health. (See <a href=\"#H565920700\" class=\"local\">'Dental care'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The safety of the patient's drinking water should be considered. Private wells and public sources may be contaminated with giardia or cryptosporidium. The latter is resistant to chlorination. Some advocate use of filtration systems or bottled water, although this issue has not been extensively investigated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social integration is always desirable, and it is a goal of therapy to make this as easy and successful as possible. While exposure to infectious illnesses is relatively high in crowded environments such as shopping malls or in school, nevertheless, with reasonable precautions, most patients with primary immunodeficiency do not require &quot;isolation&quot; nor must they strictly avoid these areas. One possible exception may be large institutional daycare or preschool settings, where the high rate of hand-to-mouth contact may be difficult to manage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2489669727\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The issues surrounding vaccination of patients with PID are reviewed in depth separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-patients-with-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in patients with primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H700594245\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436343795\"><span class=\"h2\">Treating acute infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunocompromised individuals do not clear infections or respond to anti-infective therapy as well as immunocompetent individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Many practitioners prescribe standard (short) courses of antibiotics to treat common infections, such as otitis media, sinusitis, or pneumonia, in immunodeficient patients. This often leads to rapid relapse or recurrence of infection and further morbidity, including permanent scarring and loss of function. Optimal duration of antimicrobial treatment of immunodeficient patients has not been defined. Experienced clinical immunologists often prescribe courses of antimicrobials that are two to three times longer than standard recommendations. For example, rather than treating acute sinusitis with 10 days of antibiotics, some immunodeficient patients may require a 21-day course (or even up to 28 to 30 days), with careful observation in the initial weeks after treatment to make sure that symptoms do not reappear.</p><p>Prophylaxis should be considered for patients who relapse quickly after prolonged courses of antimicrobials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3942620081\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the use of prophylactic antimicrobials is intended to reduce the frequency and severity of sinopulmonary infections caused by common bacteria. However, other forms of antiviral and antifungal treatments may be necessary in particular disorders. There is no standardized approach to the use of prophylactic antimicrobials in patients with immunodeficiency. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of prophylaxis in specific immune disorders are lacking, with a few notable exceptions (eg, chronic granulomatous disease [CGD]). A survey of American immunologists with clinical focus in PID reported that, in the absence of consensus guidelines, approximately 75 percent of practitioners administered prophylactic antibiotics to at least some of their immunodeficiency patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This proportion was significantly greater than among immunologists who saw only a few PID patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe combined immunodeficiency or other combined immunodeficiency prior to definitive therapy (stem cell transplant) may receive some combination of antibacterial, antiviral, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antifungal prophylaxis as required by their specific diagnoses, exposures, and infection history.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic therapy with combinations of antimicrobials may also be required for particular infection susceptibilities associated with specific immune defects. As an example, patients with CGD benefit from prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals, and interferon-gamma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-granulomatous-disease-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic granulomatous disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis alone is most consistently offered to patients with mild hypogammaglobulinemia, selective immunoglobulin A deficiency (sIgAD), or immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass deficiency, who are not receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Some patients may require antibiotics only during certain times of the year (eg, over the winter) or only for a few years. In more severely affected patients, prophylaxis may need to be year-round and may last for years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with more severe antibody deficiencies receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> may have an increased rate of bacterial infections chronically or at certain times of the year (eg, during the winter) and may also benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. However, there are no published controlled studies of the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis in this population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiviral (herpesvirus family) prophylaxis is indicated in some patients with recurrent mucosal or skin herpes simplex outbreaks in the context of specific immunodeficiencies, including those with defects in natural killer cells or defects in toll-like receptor 3 signaling.
