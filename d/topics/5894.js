Women undergo oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy less frequently than in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A 2005 United States nationwide study reported that unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy was performed in 68 percent of women at the time of abdominal hysterectomy, 60 percent at laparoscopic hysterectomy, and 26 percent at vaginal hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A study from 2013 to 2014 showed that 44 percent of women younger than 51 years had oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy for benign disease (outcomes were: normal ovaries 23 percent; ovarian cancer 0.2 percent; and benign pathology 21 percent). </p><p>Historically, it had been common practice to counsel women in their mid-40s or older who were planning hysterectomy for benign indications to undergo concomitant bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The rationale for this approach was that oophorectomy greatly decreases the risk of ovarian cancer and the need for future ovarian surgery, and that there is little disadvantage of ovarian preservation, since women in this age range are close to or beyond menopause. This approach also assumed nearly universal treatment with postmenopausal hormone therapy. </p><p>A growing understanding of the potential long-term health risks of elective oophorectomy and potential advantages of elective salpingectomy in premenopausal women has changed clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In the setting of benign disease, the decision to retain or remove tubes and ovaries should be based upon the long-term health effects. The pendulum has swung toward ovarian conservation in women under age 51 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>].</p><p>For women with a gynecologic malignancy, there are often clear indications for salpingo-oophorectomy. For those at high genetic risk of ovarian cancer, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy or salpingectomy may be indicated. </p><p>An evidence-based approach to management of the tubes and ovaries at the time of hysterectomy for benign disease will be reviewed here.

Ultimately, estrogen levels remain low and FSH levels high, but there is no specific hormone level profile that unequivocally characterizes the onset of natural menopause. Intact postmenopausal ovaries continue to be hormonally active for many years beyond menopause, producing androgens including testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), as well as very small amounts of estradiol and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although estrogen secretion by the postmenopausal ovary eventually ceases, ovarian secretion of small amounts of testosterone and the androgen precursor, DHEA, may continue into the eighth decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. </p><p>Extraovarian sources of sex steroids throughout life include the adrenal glands and widespread target tissues, including fat, where aromatization of androgens into estrogen occurs. The extent to which extraovarian sex steroid hormone synthesis differs between women who have experienced natural versus surgical menopause has been debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], but it appears that total androgen levels remain lower after surgical menopause than after natural menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12798793\"><span class=\"h2\">Early menopause following hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysterectomy appears to alter ovarian function over the long-term, even if the ovaries are conserved.

Observational studies have found that women who undergo hysterectomy develop menopausal symptoms and menopausal hormone profiles earlier than controls that did not have a hysterectomy.

Women in this study were initially invited to participate in the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative randomized trial that evaluated postmenopausal hormone therapy, but were either found ineligible or declined to participate in the trial. The majority of women were 49 years or younger at the time of hysterectomy and the average age at enrollment was 63 years; 82 percent were white; women were followed for an average of only eight years. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Mayo Clinic Cohort Study of Oophorectomy and Aging was a retrospective population-based cohort study of 2365 women in Olmstead County, Minnesota who underwent unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy for benign disease; almost all women were white [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For some analyses, women from the cohort were compared with controls who had not had an oophorectomy and were identified via random digit telephone dialing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The median age at time of surgery was 44 years among premenopausal women who had a bilateral oophorectomy and 62 years among postmenopausal women. Women who had a bilateral oophorectomy were followed for an average of 25 years; 95 percent had the oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy. Although this study was retrospective, it includes prospective data from centralized medical records regarding the surgical, pharmacy, and outcome data for all participants. Thus, recall bias was limited and there was access to long-term follow-up data. </p><p/><p>Findings from these studies, as well as from other relevant studies, are reviewed in the sections that follow. Data from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative conflict with data from the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study and the Mayo Clinic Cohort Study regarding many outcomes, including risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and osteoporotic fractures. We regard the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study as having the best available data, based upon several methodologic limitations of the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative Observational Study. Both the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study and the Mayo Clinic Cohort Study had long follow-up periods (28 to 30 years), adequate to assess outcomes that are more common for women over age 60 years: cardiovascular disease and stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and all-cause mortality, and shorter gaps between oophorectomy and enrollment. In contrast, women in the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative were followed for only a mean of 8 years with an average gap of 14 years from oophorectomy to enrollment. The average age at enrollment in the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative Observational Study was 63 years. Thus, women who had outcomes of interest (cardiovascular disease and stroke, dementia, osteoporosis, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and all-cause mortality) that occurred during the interval from hysterectomy to enrollment were not included, introducing a significant survivor bias to the analysis. Finally, the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative Observational Study reported that bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy did not have significant adverse effects on all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, hip fracture, or cancer, but the study has insufficient statistical power to detect differences for these outcomes. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24792980\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS OF ELECTIVE OOPHORECTOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24793011\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian cancer risk reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Ovarian-like cancers of the peritoneum, known as peritoneal cancer, may develop after oophorectomy. Oophorectomy performed for ovarian cancer risk reduction should include removal of the fallopian tubes since occult primary fallopian tubal cancers have been reported in women undergoing risk-reducing BSO.

The majority of these surgeries were performed within five years of the hysterectomy for the indication of pelvic pain or a pelvic mass. In one series of 2561 hysterectomies, among 73 women with residual ovary syndrome, histologic examination revealed functional cysts in 51 percent, benign neoplasms in 43 percent, and ovarian carcinoma in 12 percent of cases (some patients had more than one diagnosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The other series included 1265 women and found that the frequency of residual ovary syndrome was twice as high in women who had one ovary preserved, rather than both (7.6 versus 3.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, residual ovary syndrome was more common in women who underwent hysterectomy at a young age, possibly because of the longer period of post-procedure ovarian function with a greater opportunity for functional ovarian pathology.</p><p>Some data suggest that the reoperation rate is higher in women who undergo abdominal or laparoscopic hysterectomy compared with a vaginal route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The reason for such a difference is uncertain, but it could be that vaginal hysterectomy is typically not performed when ovarian pathology in one or both ovaries is suspected. </p><p>In women who require oophorectomy subsequent to hysterectomy, laparoscopic techniques have reduced the surgical morbidity of such procedures. However, surgical adhesions from prior hysterectomy may make a laparoscopic approach more difficult. One small study reported that 32 of 35 women with a prior hysterectomy were able to have a successful laparoscopic oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thus, minimally invasive surgery will provide a solution for most women who develop ovarian pathology following hysterectomy. Therefore, the possible need for subsequent surgery does not appear to justify the deleterious long-term consequences of BSO for most women undergoing hysterectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24792988\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS OF ELECTIVE OOPHORECTOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24792996\"><span class=\"h2\">Added surgical risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Operative complications are uncommon in women undergoing elective bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) at the time of hysterectomy. The risk of such complications is increased if adhesions or other intraabdominal pathology are present. </p><p>The impact of BSO on surgical morbidity is controversial. This may depend somewhat upon surgical route. For hysterectomy performed via laparotomy or laparoscopy, BSO does not appreciably increase the complexity of the procedure. In contrast, when BSO is combined with vaginal hysterectomy, the procedure is potentially more difficult. The degree of difficulty depends upon the extent of descensus of the ovaries and the extent to which the ovaries can be brought into the narrow surgical field. This is consistent with the findings of a study of over two million women in the United States who underwent hysterectomy for benign indications from 1998 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. There was an increase in complications when BSO was performed in women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy (odds ratio [OR] 1.12; 95% CI 1.08-1.17), but not for those who had an abdominal (OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.89-0.94) or laparoscopic hysterectomy (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.83-0.94).

Among women in the Mayo Clinic Cohort of Oophorectomy and Aging who were postmenopausal at the time of surgery, there was a significant increase in the risk of any osteoporotic fracture (moderate trauma fractures of the hip, spine, or distal forearm) as compared to expected rates (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 1.54; 95% CI, 1.29&ndash;1.82), but almost as large an increase in fractures at other sites (SIR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13&ndash;1.59) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Likewise, women who were premenopausal at the time of surgery had an increased risk of distal forearm (SIR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0-2.0) and vertebral fractures (SIR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.8), but not hip fracture (SRI 1.1, 95% CI 0.6-1.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>However, oophorectomy at time of hysterectomy was not found to be associated with hip fracture in either the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study or the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative Observational Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>].

The approach to decisions must include comprehensive counseling regarding risks and benefits and shared decision-making between the clinician and patient. &#160;</p><p>The first step is to determine whether the choice regarding oophorectomy is truly elective (see <a href=\"#H24792659\" class=\"local\">'Indications for oophorectomy'</a> above). All women planning hysterectomy should be assessed for risk factors for ovarian and breast cancer. In addition, an appropriate evaluation for extrauterine pelvic pathology should be performed. Strategies for cancer risk reduction in women at high risk of ovarian cancer due to hereditary ovarian and breast cancer syndromes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-reducing-bilateral-salpingo-oophorectomy-in-women-at-high-risk-of-epithelial-ovarian-and-fallopian-tubal-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women at high risk of epithelial ovarian and fallopian tubal cancer&quot;, section on 'Cancer risk reduction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-at-high-risk-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bilateral oophorectomy is associated with a small absolute cancer risk reduction for women who are at an average risk of ovarian or breast cancer. Ovarian cancer is not a common disease and hysterectomy itself provides a small preventive effect. Removal of the fallopian tube may provide added risk reduction. Some data suggest an association between oophorectomy and decreased risk of breast cancer in women who are younger than 45 years, but no decrease in breast cancer mortality has been found. (See <a href=\"#H24793011\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian cancer risk reduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8214361\" class=\"local\">'Breast cancer risk reduction'</a> above.).</p><p>There are conflicting data on long-term health effects of elective oophorectomy beyond ovarian and breast cancer risk reduction. The best available data are from observational studies, some of which conflict with each other. Given the current evidence, elective oophorectomy may be associated with an increase in long-term risks of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease, particularly in women who are younger than 45 to 54 years at the time of surgery (see <a href=\"#H325404\" class=\"local\">'All-cause mortality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21231434\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease and stroke'</a> above). Cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, psychiatric symptoms, sexual dysfunction, and osteoporosis are additional risks. (See <a href=\"#H21231441\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive function and neurologic disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21231462\" class=\"local\">'Depression and anxiety'</a> above and <a href=\"#H326764\" class=\"local\">'Sexual dysfunction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H326484\" class=\"local\">'Osteoporosis'</a> above.)</p><p>In the short-term, premenopausal women who undergo bilateral oophorectomy will experience the abrupt onset of menopause and will typically have bothersome menopausal symptoms (eg, hot flashes, sleep disturbance, and mood changes). These symptoms may be treated with postmenopausal estrogen therapy; significant risks of therapy have not been demonstrated in premenopausal women. Withholding estrogen therapy from young women who experience premature or early menopause due to oophorectomy, however, may, on the other hand, pose significant risks, based on the evidence presented here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a>.) </p><p>For women who have already experienced natural menopause, elective bilateral oophorectomy may be health neutral. Although, a decision analysis based upon a comprehensive review of observational data concluded that ovarian conservation at time of benign hysterectomy until age 65 years benefits long-term survival, and that the risks and benefits of elective oophorectomy approximate each other after age 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p>The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) advises strong consideration of ovarian conservation at time of hysterectomy in premenopausal women who are not at an increased genetic risk of ovarian cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. They advise consideration of oophorectomy at time of hysterectomy in women who are postmenopausal or who have a condition that may benefit from oophorectomy (eg, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain). &#160;</p><p>Given these considerations and the available data, for most women who undergo hysterectomy for benign indications in the absence of ovarian pathology or a familial cancer syndrome, we suggest ovarian conservation and discussion regarding removal of the fallopian tubes. Oophorectomy is reasonable for women who place a higher priority on ovarian cancer prevention than on other long-term health risks, particularly those who are 51 years old or older.</p><p>The decision regarding salpingo-oophorectomy is more difficult for women who have some risk factors for ovarian cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59585 \">table 2</a>), but who do not have a hereditary cancer syndrome. Ovarian cancer risk assessment tools have been proposed, but are not well validated. As an example, one case control study found a 4 percent lifetime increased risk of ovarian cancer in women with five or more of the following risk factors: Jewish ethnicity, less than one year of oral contraceptive use, nulliparity, no breastfeeding, no tubal ligation, painful periods or endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome or obesity, and talc use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Counseling of such patients believed to be at intermediate risk of ovarian cancer must be individualized, and should include a full discussion of all of the advantages and disadvantages of elective oophorectomy versus elective salpingectomy versus elective salpingo-oophorectomy. (See <a href=\"#H24793011\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian cancer risk reduction'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21231469\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTROGEN THERAPY AFTER OOPHORECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women experiencing premature or early menopause due to bilateral oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy are different from women who reach menopause at the median age of 51 years, and data regarding the use of hormone therapy in naturally menopausal women should not be extrapolated to women who have surgical menopause at the time of hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Observational data consistently indicate that several of the serious long-term health consequences of bilateral oophorectomy can be ameliorated by taking estrogen therapy until at least age 50 to 51 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/28,44,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,44,53</a>]. </p><p>Women who are treated with hormone therapy after hysterectomy may take estrogen therapy alone, since a progestogen for endometrial protection is not needed. Among women under 60 years of age, risks associated with hormone therapy in the Women's Health Initiative were greater in women taking estrogen plus progesterone as compared with the minimal to no risks associated with hormone therapy in women taking estrogen alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Following bilateral oophorectomy, some clinicians treat women with androgen therapy for sexual dysfunction; other indications for androgens in this population are not well established and concern for increased risk of breast cancer and cardiovascular disease has been raised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elective-oophorectomy-or-ovarian-conservation-at-the-time-of-hysterectomy/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>].

It has been common practice to counsel women who were planning hysterectomy for benign indications, particularly in their mid-40s or older, to undergo concomitant bilateral oophorectomy. This recommendation is now replaced by consideration of elective salpingectomy for women at general population risk of ovarian cancer in the absence of other benign ovarian pathology. (See <a href=\"#H21231548\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elective oophorectomy refers to the removal of the ovaries in a woman who has no known indication for this procedure (eg, ovarian pathology, hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome). Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy refers to the removal of the tubes and ovaries in a woman at high risk of ovarian or breast cancer due to a known gene mutation. (See <a href=\"#H12797502\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oophorectomy is associated with a reduction in the risk of ovarian cancer. Some data suggest that breast cancer risk is probably reduced in women who are premenopausal at time of surgery but only if performed before age 47.5.
