The testis and cord are freed from surrounding attachments, and the testis is manipulated into the scrotum and sutured in place. The procedure is performed through either an inguinal or scrotal incision.

The most significant complication is testicular atrophy (related to ischemic injury secondary to the dissection of the testicular vessels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postoperative swelling and inflammation).
