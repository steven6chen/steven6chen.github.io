There are five subtypes of calcinosis cutis: dystrophic, metastatic, idiopathic, iatrogenic, and calciphylaxis.</p><p>The treatment of calcinosis cutis is often challenging and the subtype influences the approach to treatment. Potential interventions include treatment for an underlying disease, medication to reduce calcium deposits, medication to minimize inflammation, and physical removal of calcium deposits.</p><p>The management of the various subtypes of calcinosis cutis will be reviewed here. The diagnosis and evaluation of patients with calcinosis cutis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcinosis-cutis-etiology-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcinosis cutis: Etiology and patient evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy)&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369141007\"><span class=\"h1\">DYSTROPHIC CALCINOSIS CUTIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dystrophic calcinosis cutis, the most common form of calcinosis cutis, results from local tissue injury. Dystrophic calcinosis cutis most frequently occurs in association with autoimmune connective tissue diseases (particularly systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis); therefore, the treatment of this presentation will be reviewed here. Less common causes include lobular panniculitides, porphyria cutanea tarda, select genodermatoses, cutaneous neoplasms, traumatic injury, and parasitic infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcinosis-cutis-etiology-and-patient-evaluation#H589826893\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcinosis cutis: Etiology and patient evaluation&quot;, section on 'Dystrophic calcinosis cutis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18257623\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of dystrophic calcinosis cutis associated with autoimmune connective tissue disease is often difficult. Therefore, the primary goal of treatment is to minimize symptoms and alleviate functional limitations rather than the complete resolution of cutaneous calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Management typically begins with consideration of two questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the underlying autoimmune connective tissue disease adequately treated?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do the signs and symptoms of calcinosis cutis warrant treatment?</p><p/><p>Suppression of activity of the associated autoimmune disease is suggested based upon the theory that tissue injury induced by autoimmune disease contributes to risk for cutaneous calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Consideration of the severity of the signs and symptoms of calcinosis cutis is suggested because the response to treatment is variable and unpredictable and there is risk for treatment-related adverse effects. Clinical follow-up without intervention to reduce calcium deposits is a reasonable option for calcinosis cutis that is asymptomatic, non-progressive, unassociated with internal involvement, and of minimal concern to the patient.</p><p>Once the decision is made to pursue treatment, the challenge is to determine the best initial treatment regimen. Although responses to a wide variety of therapies are documented in the literature, there are insufficient data for definitive conclusions on the most effective treatment pathway. The therapeutic options include drugs that influence calcium or phosphorus metabolism, reduce associated inflammation, or act through unclear mechanisms. Small calcium deposits may respond better to medical therapy than larger deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Physical removal of individual calcium deposits is an alternative primary or adjunctive approach that may yield symptom relief in affected patients.</p><p>Patients who respond to medical therapies for calcinosis cutis are often maintained on continuous or intermittent treatment for months to years in an attempt to reduce risk for recurrence of disease. The ideal duration of medical treatment for calcinosis cutis is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367008705\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our preferred first-line treatments for dystrophic calcinosis cutis associated with autoimmune connective tissue disease are relatively safe oral therapies that have been reported effective for some patients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diltiazem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> are included in this category. Colchicine and minocycline may primarily improve symptoms of calcinosis cutis through antiinflammatory effects. Therefore, we favor colchicine or minocycline therapy for patients presenting with prominent inflammation or ulceration (see <a href=\"#H367008722\" class=\"local\">'Therapies for inflammation'</a> below). Our patients who do not respond well to diltiazem, colchicine, or minocycline are candidates for other therapies. (See <a href=\"#H18258859\" class=\"local\">'Other drug therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>Because the relative efficacies of the wide variety of medications used for calcinosis cutis and indications for specific treatments are unclear, other approaches to treatment and regimens combining therapies are reasonable. Patient-specific factors, such as comorbidities and tolerance for specific interventions, should influence the selection of treatment.</p><p>Surgical removal of calcinosis is an additional approach that may be useful for patients with discrete symptomatic areas of calcinosis cutis initially or as an adjunct to medical therapy. Although early reports documenting poor wound healing and sinus track formation led to the historical avoidance of surgical procedures for dystrophic calcinosis cutis, subsequent reports suggest that surgery can be effective for some patients. (See <a href=\"#H367010274\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18257644\"><span class=\"h3\">Diltiazem</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diltiazem</a> is a common first-line treatment for dystrophic calcinosis cutis associated with autoimmune connective tissue disease; however, data on efficacy are limited to case reports and case series with conflicting conclusions on efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Support for the drug stems from a retrospective study of patients with calcinosis cutis associated with autoimmune connective tissue disease in which 17 patients were given diltiazem (&le;480 mg per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Of the 17 patients, 9 had a partial response to diltiazem, 3 had insufficient documentation of the outcome, and the remainder did not respond to therapy. In contrast, a low rate of response (as assessed with radiologic examination) was documented in a separate series of adults treated with 180 mg per day of diltiazem for subcutaneous calcinosis cutis associated with systemic sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Slight improvement was evident in only 3 of 12 patients. A 2014 review of published cases found benefit of diltiazem documented in slightly more than half of reported cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcinosis-cutis-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Diltiazem</a> inhibits calcium influx in cells, which may account for its effectiveness in decreasing dystrophic calcification.
