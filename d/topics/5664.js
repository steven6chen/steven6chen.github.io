Compelling data indicate that the ICD is also effective in the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in select high risk patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most ICD candidates are ambulatory and appear well enough to drive an automobile. However, due to the risks of ventricular arrhythmias and ICD shocks, there are concerns about the risks associated with driving in this population. This topic will review issues related to driving in patients with an ICD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONCERNS WITH DRIVING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns about driving center on the risk of symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmias <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ICD discharge. More specifically, the risks associated with driving are based upon the likelihood that such events could impair consciousness and the patient's ability to control the vehicle. Driving, therefore, carries risk for the patient, other occupants of the vehicle, and persons outside of the vehicle. The extension of risk to others makes this issue a public health concern. Data regarding the risks associated with driving with an ICD are primarily retrospective, with no prospective trials that have randomized patients to driving with or without restrictions, and recommendations are based primarily on expert opinion and public policy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both ventricular arrhythmias and the actions of the ICD itself can potentially interfere with driving by several mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden cardiac death &ndash; Although ICDs improve survival, they do not entirely eliminate the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Data from major trials indicate that the rate of SCD among patients who receive an ICD for secondary prevention is one to two percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Similar or slightly lower SCD rates have been reported in major primary prevention trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope &ndash; Even rapid treatment of a ventricular arrhythmia by an ICD may not protect against driving impairment, since syncope or altered states of consciousness can still occur. In a review of 421 ICD patients, for example, syncope occurred in approximately 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Syncope'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient incapacitation from the shock &ndash; Even if therapy is successful and the patient remains conscious, the discomfort from an ICD discharge, either appropriate or inappropriate, may startle or briefly incapacitate the patient and disrupt safe motor vehicle operation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and ICD shocks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the first issues to consider when evaluating the patient is the overall incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and ICD shocks in patients with these devices. Although this information does not directly translate into risks associated with driving, it does provide a general sense of the likelihood of such an event.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">In patients treated for secondary prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias and ICD therapies among patients treated with an ICD for secondary prevention is illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 299 patients, over an average follow-up of 10 months, 66,000 episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred in 281 patients (236 per patient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The arrhythmia terminated spontaneously in 74 percent, after antitachycardia pacing in 22 percent, and after a shock in only 1.7 percent (four per patient). Inappropriate discharges, due to supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, electrical noise, or other cause, occurred in 92 patients (23 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the AVID trial, among the 449 patients assigned to ICD therapy, the proportion of patients with an arrhythmic event (arrhythmic death, sustained ventricular arrhythmia, shock or antitachycardia pacing) was 35 percent at three months, 53 percent at one year, and 68 percent at two years&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. First shocks or antitachycardia pacing after the second year were uncommon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several additional studies noted a similar incidence of appropriate early therapy for VT or VF (eg, 33 to 46 percent of patients at one year and 55 percent at 15 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p/><p>In a related concern, among patients treated with an ICD for secondary prevention, one device therapy seems to suggest an increased risk of additional events in the next year. In an illustrative series, the mean time to first ICD therapy was 138 days; among those with a first event, the mean time to second ICD therapy was only 66 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients with an initial ICD therapy had a 79 percent likelihood of another ICD therapy within one year.</p><p>Patients who do not have an ICD therapy within the first year appear to have a lower, but still appreciable, risk of future events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. One report, for example, identified 14 patients who had not received an appropriate shock at 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The actuarial risk of an appropriate shock in the next 24 months was 29 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">In patients treated for primary prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While patients receiving an ICD for primary prevention have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death compared with the general population, their risk of an arrhythmia resulting in an ICD shock is generally lower than those patients whose ICD was placed for secondary prevention. Earlier primary prevention ICD trials reported device discharge rates as high as 50 percent in one year and 60 percent in two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]. However, lower rates of ICD discharges (about 6 to 8 percent per year) were observed in later trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/5,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,17</a>]. As an example, among 1500 patients in MADIT-RIT who received an ICD for primary prevention (average follow up 1.4 years), the annual incidence of ICD shocks was 6.4 percent (3.5 percent appropriate shocks, 2.9 percent inappropriate shocks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The incidence of syncope among patients treated with an ICD for secondary prevention ranges from 15 to 46 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/7,12,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,21,22</a>].</p><p>The frequency, causes of, and risk factors for syncope were evaluated in a review of 421 patients with an ICD for secondary prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In one series, among ICD patients with syncope during a prior episode of VT, the median time to a first recurrent syncopal event was 376 days, suggesting that, in patients who present with syncope and VT, the standard six month driving restriction may be inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very rapid VT (cycle length less than 300 msec) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>The authors suggested that these risk factors may be used to risk-stratify ICD patients for future syncopal events.

The main cause is supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, including sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. Such patients may become quite uncomfortable since multiple inappropriate shocks are often delivered with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Other causes of inappropriate shocks include electrical noise and ICD malfunction (eg, lead fracture) or inappropriate sensing.

A total of 1,188 patients treated with an ICD for a range of primary and secondary prevention indications were followed for a median of 562 days. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated risk of an ICD shock within one hour of driving was one shock per 25,000 person-hours of driving.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative risk for ICD shocks for <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> within one hour of driving compared to other times was 2.24. However, the elevated risk was limited to the 30 minutes after driving (relative risk 4.46 compared to other times), rather than during the driving episode itself (relative risk 1.05 compared to other times).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Accidents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among ICD patients, the actual incidence of motor vehicle accidents associated with device therapies and ventricular arrhythmias appears to be low. A mathematical expression of the yearly risk of harm to other road users caused by a patient who develops loss of consciousness due to ventricular arrhythmia has been proposed by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk of harm = TD x V x SCI x Ac</p><p/><p>where TD = the time the patient spends driving a car; V = a constant based upon the type of vehicle driven (1.0 for a commercial vehicle and 0.28 for a standard-size passenger car); SCI = the risk of sudden death or incapacity during the year; and Ac = the probability that SCI will result in a death or injury.</p><p>Based upon data from previous reports and the risk of harm equation, it has been suggested the annual risk of harm to other drivers and passersby by drivers with an ICD is 1 in 45,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Since most arrhythmic episodes occur in the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], the risk should decrease over time. One report estimated the rate of accidents in patients with an ICD as 1 in 43,000 the first year, 1 in 83,000 in the second year, and 1 in 111,000 in the third year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The values were lower in lower risk patients (LVEF &gt;40 percent, no chronic atrial fibrillation, and no inducible rapid VT).</p><p>In a contemporary cohort of 14,230 ICD recipients who received an ICD between 2008 and 2013 and had at least one subsequent shock, the risk of harm related to driving fell below an accepted threshold of four to six months post-shock when using a conservative estimate of the likelihood of loss of consciousness (32 percent of ICD shocks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, when using a more contemporary estimate of a 14 percent chance of losing consciousness consistent with rates seen with contemporary ICD programming, the risk of harm dropped below the accepted threshold at approximately one month.</p><p>A low rate of accidents has also been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. A report from the AVID trial evaluated 627 patients who were drivers before their arrhythmia, who were treated with either an ICD or antiarrhythmic drugs, and who completed a questionnaire a median of nine months after entry into the trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/driving-restrictions-in-patients-with-an-implantable-cardioverter-defibrillator/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The observations discussed in this topic are consistent with the conclusion that, although restricting driving for a short period of time after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation may be necessary, excessive restrictions or a total ban may be unwarranted. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Concerns with driving'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of arrhythmic events patients experience, the presence or absence of syncope, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, with a low value being a powerful predictor of an increased risk of arrhythmias), and antiarrhythmic drug treatment are some of the factors that need to be considered in the decision to resume driving. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Predictors of events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All reversible factors that might cause or exacerbate ventricular arrhythmia should be corrected (eg, coronary ischemia, drug toxicity, and electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sustained-monomorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-in-patients-with-structural-heart-disease-treatment-and-prognosis#H7842429\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in patients with structural heart disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Treatment of associated conditions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When making therapeutic decisions for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, the clinician should make it clear to the patient and family members that driving restrictions may be independent of whether the patient is treated with an ICD or antiarrhythmic drugs, as other medical conditions may also contribute to the need to restrict driving. Such discussions can be difficult because of the importance of driving for both independence and quality of life.
