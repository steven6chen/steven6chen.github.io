The prevalence of raised fibrous plaques in the aorta and coronary arteries also increased with age from approximately 20 percent in subjects between 2 and 15 years of age to 70 percent in those between 26 and 39 years of age. The prevalence and the extent of atherosclerosis found in the aorta and coronary arteries were greater with increasing body mass index (BMI), blood pressure measurements, and levels of serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

Female patients lagged by five years behind male patients in the progression of the extent of raised lesions in the right coronary arteries. In a subsequent report, individuals with early and more severe atherosclerotic changes were more likely to have had one or more of the following known adult CVD risk factors: dyslipidemia, smoking, hypertension, obesity, and hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-development-of-atherosclerosis-in-childhood/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent study examined autopsy reports of 3832 United States service members who died in combat or due to unintentional injury between 2001 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-development-of-atherosclerosis-in-childhood/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In adults, metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased risk of CV events, and all cause mortality. The concept of metabolic syndrome in childhood is primarily used in research; it is not used in routine clinical care because the relationship between childhood metabolic syndrome and CVD events is not well characterized and there is no consensus on the pediatric definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-development-of-atherosclerosis-in-childhood/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Family history'</a>.)</p><p>In children, evidence of accelerated atherosclerosis (eg, lower brachial arterial reactivity and greater CIMT) is more commonly detected in adolescent offspring of individuals with premature myocardial infarction compared with controls without a family history of premature CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-and-development-of-atherosclerosis-in-childhood/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the sensitivity of a positive family history for detection of CVD or dyslipidemia appears to be relatively low.
