Deaths from unintentional injuries account for more years of potential life lost before age 65 years than cancer, heart disease, or any other cause of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For every injury death, an estimated 25 hospitalizations and 925 emergency department visits occur. Most of these injuries are caused by falls, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs), bicycle collisions, and burns; many are preventable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric injury prevention: Epidemiology, history, and application&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-falls-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of falls in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Due in large part to national injury prevention efforts, the overall unintentional injury death rate in United States children, aged 0 to 19 years, declined by 29 percent from 2000 to 2009. These injury prevention efforts include seat belt use, child safety seat and booster seat use, licensing requirements, vehicle design, and reductions in alcohol-impaired driving. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric injury prevention: Epidemiology, history, and application&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.) </p><p>However, even with these efforts, MVCs remain the leading cause of unintentional injury death among 15 to 19 year olds. Furthermore, the unintentional injury death rate for infants younger than one year of age has risen from 2000 to 2009. It is clear that ongoing injury prevention efforts, such as the National Action Plan for Child Injury Prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], are needed to prevent these needless injuries and deaths. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric injury prevention: Epidemiology, history, and application&quot;, section on 'Injury prevention resources'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75117179\"><span class=\"h1\">INJURY PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Types of prevention include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary injury prevention seeks to prevent the incident (eg, motor vehicle collision [MVC]) altogether. An example of primary prevention would be road construction that separates the directions of traffic with impregnable barriers so that head on collisions cannot occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary injury prevention decreases the likelihood of serious injury during a traumatic event. Seat belts or air bags would be an example of secondary prevention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tertiary prevention minimizes further deterioration and reduces complications when injury is not prevented by primary or secondary means.</p><p/><p>Tertiary prevention entails rapid identification of children with major trauma in the pre-hospital setting so that appropriate management, destination, and utilization of emergency department resources can be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the United States, experts have developed a field triage guideline that identifies those patients who warrant direct pre-hospital transportation to a trauma center. This critical field transport decision requires the evaluation of vital signs, level of consciousness, injury anatomy, injury mechanism, and special patient or local emergency medical systems considerations. These guidelines recommend that children &quot;should be triaged preferentially to pediatric-capable trauma centers&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81002\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81002 \">algorithm 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, seriously injured children require skillful assessment and treatment by clinicians experienced in pediatric trauma and rapid evacuation to a regional pediatric trauma center, when available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The introduction and spread of statewide trauma systems, the adoption of the American College of Surgeons' (ACS) Trauma Center verification for pediatric trauma hospitals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66042\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66042 \">table 2</a>), and the resulting development of trauma registries and databases have allowed for more accurate categorization of pediatric trauma patients and system evaluation. This work has directed increased attention to the resources required for managing trauma, especially pediatric trauma. The different types of pediatric trauma classification systems and their uses will be discussed here. Evaluation and management of pediatric trauma patients is discussed separately.

They are based upon rapidly obtainable clinical findings. They are designed to identify patients who have a high likelihood of critical injury that may require trauma center care for optimal outcomes.</p><p>Since trauma is a time-sensitive disease, early, goal-directed therapy and prompt referral and transport of injured children to the most appropriate level of care are critical to their survival, overall functional outcomes, and the efficient functioning of the trauma system. In highly evolved trauma systems, triage and transport may begin with pre-hospital providers. Physicians and public alike should insist on a high level of pediatric education through accredited training programs and accepted national credentialing for pre-hospital providers, thereby creating an essential foundation that assures optimal age-appropriate, competent resuscitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Severity of illness or mortality prediction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severity of illness (SOI) or mortality prediction classification systems are often used retrospectively to standardize outcomes for research purposes. They may also serve as a prognostic indicator in individual patients. However, they are not used to guide early resuscitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Triage scoring systems typically are used in the field to determine physiologic risk and referral pattern for pre-hospital providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. They are designed to standardize the initial assessment of trauma patients, based upon the physiologic parameters, physical examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> injury mechanism.</p><p>The ideal triage score should be simple and easy to calculate but sensitive enough to include all patients who require a higher level of trauma services. Examples of triage scoring systems that have been validated for pediatric trauma populations include the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), Trauma Score (TS), Revised Trauma Score (RTS), and the Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52562 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. These systems work best for triage purposes when combined with information about mechanism of injury and anatomic site of injury.</p><p>Each of the existing systems has strengths and weaknesses that derive from their components.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Glasgow Coma Scale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The GCS constitutes a widely applied scoring system for all trauma patients. Although commonly used for field triage decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], the GCS is also an important component of many severity-of-illness scoring systems. Modification of the GCS to pediatric patients has been an important advance in the assessment of age-appropriate behavior in both verbal and preverbal children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662 \">table 4</a>). The GCS has also been shown to have prognostic value in children, especially the motor and verbal component of the score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]. </p><p>Use of the motor component of the GCS (mGCS) instead of the entire scale (tGCS) has been proposed to simplify field triage for trauma patients. In a systematic review of 14 studies (4 pediatric and 10 mixed populations of children and adults) that evaluated the predictive utility of the two scores, the tGCS had significantly better predictive utility than the mGCS. However, all data was retrospective and the mGCS was derived from the tGCS in all patients which limits applicability of these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Further study is needed to determine if substitution of the mGCS for the tGCS during field evaluation impacts triage accuracy or clinical outcomes. </p><p>In addition, for both preverbal (&lt;2 years old) and verbal (&gt;2 years old) children, GCS correlates with the presence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in patients with blunt head injury. As an example, in a prospective, multicenter observational study of over 40,000 children with blunt head trauma (most with minor head trauma) included in the above systematic review, the pediatric GCS in patients &lt;2 years old and the standard GCS in patients &gt;2 years old had similar accuracy for detecting clinically important TBI (ie, injury requiring neurosurgery, endotracheal intubation for &gt;24 hours, hospitalization for 2 or more nights, or causing death) with good interobserver agreement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This study supports the continued use of the pediatric GCS for preverbal children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Trauma Score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TS includes five physiologic or physical examination components, including the GCS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52562 \">table 3</a>), that are scored and added together to determine the TS value and probability of survival. The TS is limited by the use of two subjective measurements (respiratory effort and capillary refill) and may underestimate the severity in the hemodynamically stable patient with an isolated head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/7,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Revised Trauma Score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The RTS was developed to address some of the limitations of the TS; the subjective components no longer are incorporated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52562 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Pediatric trauma experts have expressed concern that the RTS is derived from adult data and that the components may not be directly applicable to children. However, comparison of the RTS with the PTS has not shown any major disadvantage to using the RTS in injured children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Pediatric Trauma Score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PTS is patterned after the evaluation process of the Advanced Trauma Life Support Course and is specifically designed for triage of the child with traumatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It is the sum of six measures incorporating size as a surrogate for age and vital signs plus organ-specific injury data (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52562 \">table 3</a>). The PTS correlates well with injury severity, mortality, resource utilization, and the need for transport to a pediatric trauma center. However, it can be a poor predictor of liver and spleen injuries for children with isolated blunt abdominal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Age-specific pediatric trauma score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age-specific pediatric trauma score (ASPTS) age adjusts blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate and combines these with the GCS to predict injury severity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This score has lower sensitivity than the RTS but is more specific. The ASPTS has two major drawbacks. First, the user must know the range of normal vital signs for children of all ages. This significantly limits the usefulness of the ASPTS in the field setting. Second, the ASPTS has not been validated in pediatric trauma patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In comparison to triage scoring systems, injury scoring systems are based upon anatomic injury and are only accurate after all injuries have been diagnosed. Injury scores remain constant once all injuries have been identified. They are used primarily for comparisons of injury severity among trauma populations, but they may accurately predict risk for adverse outcome. Examples of injury scoring systems include the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), the Injury Severity Score (ISS), and the Anatomic Profile (AP). The latter two scoring systems are based on calculations derived from the AIS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Abbreviated Injury Scale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The AIS was designed to categorize the injuries of victims of motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It scores injury severity from 1 (least severe) to 5 (survival uncertain) within six body regions: <span class=\"nowrap\">head/neck,</span> face, chest, <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> contents, extremities, and <span class=\"nowrap\">skin/general</span>. Nonsurvivable conditions are assigned an AIS of 6. The AIS does not accurately measure the effects of multiple injuries. It is used in coding injuries for other scoring systems or for outcome analysis systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Injury Severity Score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ISS is calculated from the highest AIS for the three most severely injured regions as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p> &#160;ISS = (AIS1) squared + (AIS2) squared + (AIS3) squared</p><p>The utility of the ISS is limited by its inability to adjust for the cumulative effect of coexisting injuries in one region (eg, concomitant subdural hematoma and intraparenchymal hemorrhage), the lack of a direct linear relationship between increasing score and severity, and the lack of consideration of preexisting conditions that may affect outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The ISS should be thought of as an ordinal scale, not a quantitative scale; ie, a score of 50 is not twice as lethal as a score of 25. Nonetheless, the ISS is a valid predictor of mortality, length of stay in the hospital or intensive care unit, and cost of trauma care.</p><p>While an ISS &gt;15 has traditionally been considered a marker for severe injuries, an observational study that evaluated trauma registry records for over 50,000 children identified ISS &gt;25 as a better discriminator to identify children at higher risk of severe injury regardless of whether one or more body systems were traumatized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Anatomic profile</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic profile was developed as an alternative to the ISS and gives equal weight to injuries regardless of body region. The AP uses the AIS descriptors of severity but uses only four body regions: <span class=\"nowrap\">head/brain/spinal</span> cord, <span class=\"nowrap\">thorax/neck,</span> all other serious injuries, and all non-serious injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H770250\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanism of injury is used for field classification of severity of injury and need for transportation to a designated trauma center (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81002\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81002 \">algorithm 1</a>). In an observational study of 35,097 pediatric trauma patients (age 2 to 18 years), the mechanism of injury was also associated with mortality and functional outcomes with the greatest likelihood of mortality occurring in victims of penetrating trauma when compared with blunt mechanisms (eg, falls, motor vehicle collisions [MVCs], bicycle crashes, pedestrians struck by a motor vehicle) and the greatest functional morbidity occurring in pedestrians struck by a motor vehicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcome analysis systems use both physiologic and anatomic data to estimate morbidity and mortality for an individual patient or for trauma populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

It is the only validated predictor of critical care outcome in pediatrics and incorporates information regarding cardiovascular and neurologic parameters, as well as acid-base, electrolyte, and hematologic values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In a retrospective study of 125 pediatric trauma patients, PRISM was a better predictor of resource utilization than was ISS, but underestimated mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

These scores have been shown to predict mortality with high discrimination using a limited number of variables. The PIM2 score has been shown to have comparable performance to PRISM III in certain countries and was found to be easier to use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. The PIM3 score requires only one hour of information while a PRISM III score needs 12 to 24 hours of data. Of note, both the PRISM III and PIM3 scores were developed using general Pediatric ICU patients, rather than a trauma-specific subset, and have not yet been validated for pediatric trauma patients outside of an ICU setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">International classification injury severity score (ICISS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ICISS is based on the anatomic injury diagnosis from the international classification of disease, ninth revision (ICD-9) and thus uses objective criteria rather than more subjective physiologic metrics. A survival risk ratio is calculated for a population based on the proportion of fatalities for each diagnosis. The probability of survival is then derived by the product of survival risk ratios from the three most severe injuries in an individual patient. Large observational studies using data derived from large registries indicate that the ICISS has shown good validity for prediction of mortality and resource use in adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and pediatric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] trauma patients.</p><p>However, in a single center observational study of almost 2000 pediatric trauma patients, the expert consensus-derived Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS) was superior to the ICISS in predicting mortality, possibly due to a loss of discrimination from the lack of physiologic parameters in the ICISS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30733484\"><span class=\"h3\">Pediatric trauma BIG score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The BIG score is calculated from the admission base deficit, international normalized ratio (INR), and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-trauma-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]:</p><p>BIG score = (base deficit) + [2.5 x INR] + [15 &ndash; GCS]</p><p>It was derived and validated in children and appears to predict mortality well regardless of whether the victims have blunt or penetrating mechanism of trauma.

They may also serve as a prognostic indicator in individual patients. However, they usually are not used to guide early resuscitation.
