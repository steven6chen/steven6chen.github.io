Glucagonomas are usually solitary, and the majority are located in the distal pancreas. Patients typically present in their fifth decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. While most glucagonomas are sporadic, up to 20 percent may be associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1 (MEN1). However, glucagonomas occur in only 3 percent of MEN1 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Glucagonomas are usually large (&gt;3 cm), and approximately 50 to 80 percent are metastatic at diagnosis. Unlike tumors complicated by carcinoid syndrome, however, liver metastases are not typically a prerequisite for the clinical syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1287588926\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION, NOMENCLATURE, AND HISTOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucagonomas are neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) derived from multipotential stem cells of endodermal origin. The World Health Organization classifies NETs arising within the digestive system based upon the extent to which they resemble their normal non-neoplastic counterparts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115945 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system#H369507898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;, section on '2017 WHO classification for pancreatic neoplasms'</a>.)</p><p>Nearly all reported cases of the glucagonoma syndrome have been associated with tumors originating in the alpha cells of the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Histologically, the tumors consist of cords and nests of well-differentiated NETs with few mitoses and a histologic appearance that is similar to that of other pancreatic NETs. The cells are arranged in a solid, trabecular, gyriform, or glandular pattern, with fairly uniform nuclei, salt-and-pepper chromatin, and finely granular cytoplasm. Glucagon is usually detectable within the tumor cells by immunoperoxidase staining, and glucagon mRNA may be detected by in situ hybridization. Characteristic alpha cell granules may be seen on electron microscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1108527112\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucagonoma syndrome is thought to be directly related to elevated glucagon levels. Glucagon, acting on the liver, increases both amino acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis from amino acid substrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The weight loss characteristic of glucagonoma may result from the catabolic action of glucagon and through glucagon-like peptides such as GLP-1. Necrolytic migratory erythema probably results from hyponutrition and amino acid deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Diarrhea may result from hyperglucagonemia and co-secretion of gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, serotonin, or calcitonin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the clinical features of glucagonoma syndrome are non-specific, the majority of patients are diagnosed late when the disease has metastasized. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1182955484\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight loss, often significant, is the most common presenting feature, occurring in 80 percent of patients with glucagonoma syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Necrolytic migratory erythema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is the presenting feature of glucagonoma syndrome in approximately 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. Although the rash can occasionally be the only symptom, in most cases patients have associated systemic symptoms. NME characteristically begins as erythematous papules or plaques involving the face, perineum, and extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73263\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73263 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Over the ensuing 7 to 14 days, the lesions enlarge and coalesce. Central clearing then occurs, leaving bronze-colored, indurated areas centrally, with blistering, crusting, and scaling at the borders. The affected areas are often pruritic and painful. The same process often affects the mucous membranes, resulting in glossitis, angular cheilitis, stomatitis, and blepharitis. Patients with NME often have associated hair loss and nail dystrophy.</p><p>The diagnosis of NME is made with skin biopsies obtained from the edge of the lesions, which reveal superficial necrolysis with separation of the outer layers of the epidermis and perivascular infiltration with lymphocytes and histiocytes. However, multiple biopsies are often required to demonstrate these findings. NME is not specific for glucagonoma syndrome and has been reported in association with other disorders in the absence of elevated glucagon levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

However, clinically significant hyperglycemia with diabetes mellitus is only present at diagnosis in approximately 40 percent of patients. Hyperglycemia due to glucagonoma syndrome does not usually result in diabetic ketoacidosis, since beta cell function is preserved and insulin secretion is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic diarrhea is the most frequent gastrointestinal manifestation of glucagonoma syndrome and is present in approximately 30 percent of patients with glucagonoma syndrome.

A normocytic normochromic anemia is present in up to 90 percent of patients. Anemia may be due to anemia of chronic disease or a direct effect of glucagon on erythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Amino acid levels are markedly diminished. Patients with glucagonoma may also have minor elevations of secondary hormones, including gastrin, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, serotonin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, and pancreatic polypeptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The diagnosis of glucagonoma is established with an inappropriately elevated fasting plasma glucagon level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1182955697\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum glucagon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of a glucagonoma requires the demonstration of increased plasma glucagon levels (&gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Plasma glucagon levels are usually elevated 10- to 20-fold in patients with glucagonoma (normal &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span>. Concentrations above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> are virtually diagnostic of glucagonoma. However, up to 70 percent of the immunoreactive glucagon may be biologically inactive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A blood glucose should be tested concurrently. Histologic diagnosis by biopsy is not required to make the diagnosis.</p><p>Conditions other than glucagonoma that can induce moderate elevations in the serum glucagon concentration (&lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> include hypoglycemia, fasting, trauma, sepsis, acute pancreatitis, abdominal surgery, Cushing's syndrome, and renal and hepatic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Idiopathic hyperglucagonemia syndrome, either familial or sporadic, is associated with a large molecular weight form of the peptide. In addition, other neuroendocrine tumors, such as carcinoid tumors, insulinomas, and gastrinomas, can secrete glucagon, although rarely in high enough levels to cause the classic clinical syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p>However, some glucagonomas are associated with serum levels of the peptide in the &quot;physiologically elevated&quot; range, even in the presence of necrolytic migratory erythema. Thus, in patients with the classic syndrome, a serum glucagon concentration below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> does not exclude a glucagonoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380691392\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) is not specific for glucagonoma syndrome and has been reported in association with hepatitis B and cirrhosis, jejunal and rectal adenocarcinoma, villous atrophy of the small intestine, and myelodysplastic syndrome in the absence of elevated glucagon levels.

We begin with helical (spiral) multiphasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of patients with a glucagonoma. We perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when CT shows indeterminate lesions that need further characterization. If cross-sectional imaging is inconclusive, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy (SRS), or 68-gallium-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotate (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> should be performed to identify the tumor. Because of its greater sensitivity, 68-Ga DOTATATE <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may be preferable to conventional SRS with 111-In pentetreotide, where available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

Intravenous contrast enhances the detection of smaller lesions, especially when images are obtained during the arterial phase. In addition, arterial phase and portal venous phase sequences can be used to maximize the conspicuity of liver metastases compared with the surrounding normal liver parenchyma. CT scans are highly accurate for detecting primary pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and, using multiphase imaging techniques, sensitivity is &gt;80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Since most pancreatic glucagonomas are more than 3 cm in size at presentation, a pancreatic mass can usually be identified by CT in the majority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The most common site of metastasis is the liver, followed by regional lymph nodes, bone, adrenal gland, kidney, and lung. Age, grade, and distant metastases are the most significant predictors of survival. Once the tumor is metastatic, cure is rarely, if ever, achieved. However, case series suggest that patients with metastatic disease have a prolonged survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. Five- and 10-year survival rates for patients undergoing resection of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (both pancreatic neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors) stratified by stage at presentation are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80523\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80523 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68311489\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucagonomas are rare functioning neuroendocrine tumors that secrete glucagon. They are usually solitary, and the majority are located in the distal pancreas. Approximately 50 to 80 percent are metastatic at diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucagonoma syndrome is thought to be directly related to elevated glucagon levels. Glucagon, acting on the liver, increases both amino acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis from amino acid substrates. Weight loss results from the catabolic action of glucagon and through glucagon-like peptides such as GLP-1. Necrolytic migratory erythema (NME) probably results from hyponutrition and amino acid deficiency. Hyperglucagonemia and co-secretion of gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, serotonin, or calcitonin lead to diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H1108527112\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucagonoma syndrome is characterized by NME, cheilitis, glucose <span class=\"nowrap\">intolerance/diabetes</span> mellitus, anemia, weight loss, chronic diarrhea, venous thrombosis, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Of these, weight loss and NME are the most prevalent symptoms at diagnosis. However, NME is not specific for glucagonoma syndrome and has been reported in association with other disorders. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucagonoma syndrome should be suspected in patients with NME with or without associated weight loss, glucose intolerance, chronic diarrhea, or venous thrombosis. The diagnosis of glucagonoma is established with an elevated fasting plasma glucagon level (&gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H3880566271\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging studies are required to accurately localize the tumor and stage the extent of disease. We begin with helical (spiral) multiphasic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of patients with a glucagonoma. We perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) when CT shows indeterminate lesions that need further characterization. If cross-sectional imaging is inconclusive, endoscopic ultrasound or somatostatin-receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">scintigraphy/Gallium-68-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-Octreotate</span> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT)</span> should be performed to identify the tumor. In addition, we perform somatostatin-receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">scintigraphy/68-Ga</span> DOTATATE <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> if the finding of extra-abdominal metastases would change management.
