Earlier reports used the terms &quot;atypical diabetes,&quot; &quot;Flatbush diabetes,&quot; &quot;diabetes type 1B,&quot; and &quot;ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot; to describe subsets of this condition, and it was noted that in some instances patients presented with DKA as the first manifestation of diabetes and evolved to insulin independence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While initially these reports suggested that the condition, now termed ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD), might be limited to persons of non-Caucasian ethnicity, its prevalence appears to be increasing in a wide range of ethnic groups worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>The classification, pathophysiology, natural history, and management of KPD will be reviewed here. Patients with islet autoantibodies who do not present with ketosis, including those termed &quot;latent autoimmune diabetes in adults&quot; (LADA), &quot;type 1.5 diabetes&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], and &quot;slowly progressing type 1 diabetes&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] are discussed elsewhere.

They also highlight subgroups for genetic and pathogenetic studies.</p><p>Ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) comprises a group of diabetes syndromes characterized by severe beta cell dysfunction (manifested by presentation with DKA or unprovoked ketosis) and a variable clinical course. These syndromes do not fit the traditional categories of diabetes defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). To date, attempts to differentiate patients with KPD into clinically distinct subgroups have resulted in four different classification schemes: the ADA system, a modified ADA system, a body mass index (BMI)-based system, and the A&szlig; system (based on the presence or absence of autoantibodies and the presence or absence of beta cell functional reserve).</p><p>In a longitudinal study comparing the four classification schemes for accuracy and predictive value, the A&szlig; system was shown to be the most accurate in predicting long-term insulin dependence 12 months after the index DKA event, with 99 percent sensitivity and 96 percent specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">ADA system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the American Diabetes Association (ADA) classification, type 1 diabetes is characterized by autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta cells, leading to absolute insulin deficiency. Markers of immune-mediated diabetes include antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and to the tyrosine phosphatase IA-2. Among patients presenting with DKA (absolute insulin deficiency), those who lack autoantibodies are referred to as &quot;idiopathic type 1&quot; or &quot;type 1b&quot;; the latter includes patients with the clinical appearance of type 2 diabetes, with some becoming insulin independent.

Patients with beta cell autoantibodies are classified as type 1a just as in the ADA scheme, while those who lack autoantibodies are distinguished retrospectively, based on long-term insulin dependence, into &quot;KPD insulin dependent&quot; (KPD-ID) and &quot;KPD non-insulin dependent&quot; (KPD-NID). Both type 1a and KPD-ID patients have clinical characteristics of type 1 diabetes with poor beta cell function, while subjects with KPD-NID have clinical characteristics of type 2 diabetes with preserved beta cell function for a prolonged duration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">BMI system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The body mass index (BMI)-based scheme separates KPD patients into lean (BMI &lt;28 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> clinically resembling type 1 with low beta cell function) or obese (BMI &ge;28 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> clinically resembling type 2 with preserved beta cell function) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">A&szlig; system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The collaborative group at Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Washington utilize a classification system (A&szlig; classification) that distinguishes four KPD subgroups based on the presence or absence of autoantibodies and the presence or absence of beta cell functional reserve, as measured by a fasting or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a>-stimulated C-peptide level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Beta cell secretory reserve'</a> below). The four subgroups are defined as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A+&szlig;- autoantibodies present, beta cell function absent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A+&szlig;+ autoantibodies present, beta cell function present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A-&szlig;- autoantibodies absent, beta cell function absent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A-&szlig;+ autoantibodies absent, beta cell function present</p><p/><p>A+&szlig;- and A-&szlig;- patients are immunologically and genetically distinct from each other but share clinical characteristics of type 1 diabetes with decreased beta cell function, and both subgroups would be termed type 1 diabetes (type 1 and 1b) in the current ADA classification system. A+&szlig;+ and A-&szlig;+ patients are immunologically and genetically distinct from each other but share clinical characteristics of type 2 diabetes with preserved beta cell functional reserve and would be termed type 2 diabetes in the ADA scheme.</p><p>A-&szlig;+ patients comprise the largest KPD subgroup (approximately 50 percent) in multiethnic cohorts of KPD patients in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72722 \">table 1</a>). They are also the patients who most commonly come to the notice of clinicians because they present with DKA yet have the clinical features and subsequent behavior of type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,14</a>]. In the interest of defining and investigating novel syndromes of beta cell dysfunction, the broader terminology of &quot;ketosis-prone diabetes&quot; with its four subgroups subsumed under the A&szlig; classification, rather than ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, is more useful and does not presume to define a syndrome a priori.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF KPD SYNDROMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoantibodies present, beta cell function absent or present</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a spectrum of beta cell destruction in patients with antibody-positive diabetes. Distinguishing A+&szlig;- from A+&szlig;+ ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) permits investigators to explore different autoimmune pathways leading to clinically distinct patterns of beta cell loss, such as different latencies and variable degrees of beta cell destruction.</p><p>The later onset and more moderate clinical course (ability to discontinue insulin for over two years following the index episode of diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA] in 50 percent of the patients) of A+&szlig;+ KPD compared with A+&szlig;- KPD appears to be related in part to epitope-specific antibodies to the 65-kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65). A specific amino-terminal epitope defined by monoclonal antibody DPD correlated with higher beta cell functional reserve and was associated with the milder A+&szlig;+ phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The mechanisms that result in this autoantibody specificity and give rise to variable beta cell functional reserve remain to be elucidated.</p><p>In a majority of healthy individuals, GAD65 antibodies (GAD65Ab) are present in the sera but are masked by anti-idiotypic antibodies; in contrast, overtly GAD65Ab-positive patients with autoimmune type 1 diabetes lack these anti-idiotypic antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Masked GAD65Ab specific for the epitope DPD are strongly associated with preserved beta cell functional reserve among patients with KPD. Absence of GAD65Ab(DPD) reactivity is associated with two human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II susceptibility haplotypes for autoimmune type 1 diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoantibodies and beta cell function absent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A-&szlig;- KPD is characterized by beta cell failure without evidence of autoimmunity. Some A-&szlig;- KPD patients may possess recently validated islet autoantibodies such as those against the zinc transporter (ZnT8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] or untested autoantibodies, such as SOX13 (SRY-related HMG box antigen 13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Alternatively, some A-&szlig;- KPD patients may be misclassified as &quot;A-&quot; because of a decline in autoantibody titers over time. In one cohort, only 10 percent of patients who were A-&szlig;- had new-onset diabetes when identified at presentation with DKA; the majority had had insulin-dependent diabetes for many years previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>However, a decline in antibody titer is less likely as GAD autoantibodies are reported to be quite durable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. In addition, extensive HLA typing reveals that the frequencies of major class II alleles associated with susceptibility to autoimmune type 1 diabetes are not significantly higher in A-&szlig;- KPD patients than in ethnic-matched population controls, whereas they are significantly higher in A+&szlig;- KPD patients, suggesting significant differences in the causes of absent beta cell function between the two populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The strong family history of diabetes among relatives of most A-&szlig;- KPD patients suggests a familial trait and the possibility that genes required for beta cell development, regeneration, or function may be defective. Potentially significant variants in the genes <em>TCF1, PAX-4, </em>and<em> PDX-1</em>, encoding the key beta cell transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor-1-alpha (HNF1a), PAX-4, and pancreas-duodenum homeobox-1 (PDX-1), are enriched in A-&szlig;- KPD patients compared with ethnicity-specific population controls; these may contribute to a monogenic etiology for the A-&szlig;- phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>While this subgroup is characterized by absence of humoral islet autoimmune markers, there could be a role for cellular islet autoimmunity. A significant proportion of A-&beta;- KPD patients manifest strong T-cell responses to islet antigens, and higher percentages of circulating proinflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoantibodies absent, beta cell function present</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The A-&szlig;+ phenotype is characterized by partially reversible beta cell dysfunction, which may be due to metabolic, genetic, or viral etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Increased oxidant stress in the islets may also contribute to A-&szlig;+ KPD. One study of West African patients suggested that X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency contributes to depressed beta cell defense against oxidant stress in the face of acute hyperglycemia in KPD patients, but its cause does not appear to be a genetic mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Short-term glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity do not appear to be critical factors in the development of beta cell decompensation in KPD patients of this subgroup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>In a study combining metabolomics with targeted kinetic measurements to investigate the pathophysiology of this KPD subgroup, a distinctive pathogenic sequence was uncovered: impaired ketone oxidation and fatty acid utilization for energy, leading to accelerated leucine catabolism and transamination of alpha-ketoglutarate to glutamate, with impaired tricarboxylic acid anaplerosis of glutamate carbon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These findings highlight a novel process of defective energy production and ketosis in this form of KPD.</p><p>Evaluation of a role for cellular islet autoimmunity (in these patients lacking humoral markers of islet autoimmunity) revealed that A-&szlig;+ KPD patients with a history of clinically evident precipitating factor for the index DKA (&quot;provoked&quot; A-&beta;+ KPD) often manifest strong T-cell responses to islet antigens and higher percentages of circulating proinflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes. In contrast, A-&beta;+ KPD patients without a clinically evident precipitating factor for the index DKA (&quot;unprovoked&quot; A-&beta;+ KPD) lack evidence for both humoral and cellular islet autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY OF KPD SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) after the initial episode of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) depends upon the presence of autoantibodies and long-term beta cell reserve. Long-term beta cell reserve is the key determinant of long-term glycemic control and insulin dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>The natural history of KPD is best detailed in large cohorts with longitudinal follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,11,12,22,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,12,22,34</a>]. One of the largest of these cohorts, the Houston cohort, includes 185 multiethnic adults patients admitted with DKA between 1999 and 2001 and followed for a mean of 5.5 years. The most frequent KPD subgroup was A-&szlig;+ (54 percent), followed by A-&szlig;-, A+&szlig;-, and A+&szlig;+ accounting for 20, 18, and 8 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The A+&szlig;- and A-&szlig;- KPD patients displayed a typical course of complete insulin dependence and difficulty in attaining and achieving excellent long-term glycemic control. Although there was no difference in the mean age of the patients admitted with DKA during study recruitment, there were significant group differences in mean age at diabetes diagnosis and duration of diabetes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72722 \">table 1</a>). Compared with patients with the A-&szlig;+ and A+&szlig;+ phenotypes, patients with the A+&szlig;- and A-&szlig;- phenotypes were diagnosed at an earlier age (approximately 25 versus 40 years) and had a longer duration of diabetes (approximately nine versus two years).</p><p>The majority of A+&szlig;+ KPD patients had new-onset diabetes. Shortly after resolution of DKA, approximately 50 percent of patients had adequate beta cell functional reserve and could discontinue insulin; the others remain insulin dependent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72722 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of A-&szlig;+ KPD patients had new-onset diabetes and developed DKA without a clinically evident precipitating factor (&quot;unprovoked&quot; A-&szlig;+ KPD), while the remainder had had longstanding diabetes prior to presentation with DKA and developed ketoacidosis in association with acute illness or noncompliance with antidiabetic treatment (&quot;provoked&quot; A-&szlig;+ KPD). Unprovoked A-&szlig;+ KPD patients displayed a striking male predominance (2.6:1, male:female) that is quite distinct from provoked A-&szlig;+ KPD patients (0.7:1); this gender imbalance has been noted also in patients with the unprovoked A-&szlig;+ KPD phenotype in other cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,34,35</a>].</p><p>Longitudinal data suggest other phenotypic differences between the unprovoked and provoked subgroups of A-&szlig;+ KPD patients. Prospective assessment of 83 unprovoked and 64 provoked A-&szlig;+ KPD patients revealed that despite equivalent degrees of hyperglycemia and beta cell functional reserve at initial testing following the index DKA episode, the two subgroups had different genetic characteristics, natural histories of beta cell function, and insulin requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Unprovoked A-&szlig;+ KPD was characterized by reversible beta cell dysfunction with male predominance and increased frequency of DQB1*0602 (resistance allele for autoimmune diabetes), whereas provoked A-&szlig;+ KPD was characterized by progressive loss of beta cell reserve and increased frequency of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) susceptibility alleles for autoimmune type 1 diabetes, DQB1*0302 and DRB1*04. In this prospective assessment, unprovoked DKA predicted long-term beta cell functional reserve, insulin independence, and glycemic control in KPD patients.</p><p>Longitudinal characterization of KPD patients presenting with concomitant acute pancreatitis and DKA reveals that despite greater clinical severity at presentation, KPD patients with acute pancreatitis have better preserved beta cell function than those without acute pancreatitis. &beta;+ KPD patients presenting with acute pancreatitis have worse long-term glycemic control than those with other causes of provoked DKA. Factors other than beta cell function negatively impact glycemic control in KPD patients presenting with acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>In a smaller cohort study of patients with new-onset, unprovoked DKA, beta cell functional reserve was preserved in a greater proportion of obese compared with lean patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,34</a>].</p><p>In another cohort study with 10-year follow-up, KPD patients with the probable A-&szlig;+ phenotype (unprovoked) initially achieved insulin independence and glycemic control with oral agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At the end of the follow-up period, 40 percent were still insulin independent. In those that required insulin, the mean duration until relapse to insulin dependence was 40 months. Some of these patients experienced relapsing and remitting ketosis.</p><p>Longer-term follow-up of a cohort of unprovoked A-&beta;+ KPD patients indicates that a fairly abrupt relapse to ketosis can occur, fairly soon after remission in some patients or after a long period of remission in others. Early relapse is associated with younger age, lack of robust increase (usually severalfold) of beta cell functional reserve, and suboptimal glycemic control after one year. Among unprovoked A-&beta;+ KPD patients, measurements of these objective parameters one year after the index DKA episode can be used reliably to justify clinical decisions and provide reassurance, if beta cell function has at least doubled over baseline, for continued insulin independence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A recent study of patients in Thailand who have a phenotype corresponding to unprovoked A-&beta;+ KPD suggests that those who maintain insulin independence may also be quite insulin sensitive, with low circulating leptin and high circulating adiponectin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF KPD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical management of ketosis-prone diabetes (KPD) includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute management of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outpatient management shortly after resolution of DKA, including classification of the patient according to KPD subgroup and evaluation of predictive factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term management</p><p/><p>Initial treatment is the same as for patients with type 1 diabetes and ketoacidosis.

Thus, a subset of patients will require long-term insulin therapy to prevent recurrent ketoacidosis.</p><p>As these patients are heterogeneous and the &quot;type&quot; of diabetes is unclear at presentation, they should all be maintained on insulin initially.

Patients of this subgroup follow one of two divergent clinical courses within the first two years of diagnosis; approximately 50 percent maintain stable beta cell function and remain insulin independent, while the others convert to &szlig;- status and become insulin dependent. Hence, identification of patients as A+&szlig;+ rather than simply &szlig;+ alerts the clinician to follow them closely. Furthermore, these are the patients in whom human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotyping provides additional prognostic markers of clinical behavior as the presence of specific autoimmune type 1 diabetes susceptibility alleles such as HLA DQB1*02 are associated with higher risk of progressive beta cell functional loss.

In regions where such testing is unavailable, future likelihood of insulin independence in atypically presenting patients can be assessed by reducing the insulin dose and monitoring serum glucose and serum or urine ketones. The safety of the latter approach depends upon a patient's ability to self-monitor and the attentiveness of the provider.

Patients are placed on twice daily NPH insulin at the time of hospital discharge, with the dose determined by the mean daily insulin requirement during the previous two hospital days. Patients with known diabetes may be given insulin at the dose they were receiving before the onset of DKA. In previously insulin-naive patients, another approach is to administer multidose insulin at a dose of 0.6 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per day, with 50 percent as regular or rapid-acting insulin (in divided doses before meals) and 50 percent as basal insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-of-ketosis-prone-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].
