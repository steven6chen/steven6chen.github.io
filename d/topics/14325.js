This inborn error of metabolism leads to an increase in the glyoxylate pool and later overproduction of oxalate.</p><p>The <em>AGXT</em> gene maps to chromosome 2q36-37 and encodes for a 43 kDa protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperoxaluria/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. More than 150 mutations have been identified in the <em>AGXT</em> gene, which are found in all 11 exons of the gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperoxaluria/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The mutations are predominantly single nucleotide substitutions (75 percent) including missense, nonsense, and splice site mutations, and the remaining mutations are due to deletions and insertions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperoxaluria/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>These mutations result in three different expressions of AGT protein and its activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperoxaluria/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of both immunoreactive AGT protein and AGT catalytic activity, which occurs in approximately 40 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of immunoreactive AGT protein and absence of AGT catalytic activity, which occurs in approximately 15 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of both immunoreactive AGT protein and AGT catalytic activity, but at levels that are 50 percent below normal values. In these patients, most of the AGT is localized in the mitochondria and not in the peroxisomes (mistargeting phenotype). Four mutations (Gly170Arg, Ile244Thr, Phe152Ile, and Gly41Arg) result in both expression of AGT protein and activity.</p><p/><p>In one study that sequenced the entire <em>AGXT</em> gene in individuals with liver biopsy-proven PH type 1, mutations were detected in 47 of 48 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperoxaluria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

There has been speculation that environmental factors or modifier genes are responsible for the range of phenotypes within a single pedigree.</p><p>There appears to be some correlation between genotype and phenotype for specific mutations of the <em>AGXT</em> gene. In particular, urinary oxalate excretion can significantly be reduced in patients with the most common mutation p.Gly170Arg (reported allelic frequency of 21.5 percent in Caucasian patients) by pyridoxine medication resulting in better long-term outcomes, when diagnosis is made early enough for medical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperoxaluria/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. A similar positive response to pyridoxine therapy is also seen in patients with p.Phe152Ile mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperoxaluria/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

In patients with PH type 1, urinary oxalate excretion exceeds 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/1</span>.73 m<sup>2 </sup>per day (normal &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperoxaluria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The increased urinary excretion of oxalate results in urinary calcium oxalate supersaturation, which leads to crystal aggregation, urolithiasis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nephrocalcinosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65169\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65169 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50463\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50463 \">image 1</a>). Calcium oxalate crystals are also deposited within the renal interstitium and renal tubule cells. Nephrocalcinosis or recurrent urolithiasis can cause renal parenchymal inflammation and fibrosis and, if persistent, end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperoxaluria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Other urinary complications associated with urolithiasis, such as infection and obstruction, also contribute to renal damage in affected patients.</p><p>The presence of nephrocalcinosis is associated with increased risk for renal failure, while the number of stones and stone events are not significantly associated with a risk of renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperoxaluria/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>As the glomerular filtration rate falls below 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, plasma oxalate levels increase because of reduced urinary oxalate excretion. When plasma oxalate exceeds 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L,</span> which is the plasma supersaturation threshold for calcium oxalate, calcium oxalate is deposited into other tissues including the retina, myocardium, vessel walls, skin, bone, and the central nervous system, which leads to the nonrenal manifestations of PH.

In this multicenter European cohort, 43 percent of patients were of North African or Middle Eastern descent.

In this cohort, 32 patients received an isolated kidney graft, and 26 patients received a combined liver and kidney. Three patients with a combined liver and kidney transplantation died with functioning allografts, which resulted in a lower five-year patient survival (67 versus 100 percent). However, the three-year kidney graft survival for survivors was higher with combined grafts compared with isolated kidney graft (95 versus 56 percent).

As renal function deteriorates, plasma oxalate exceeds 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> (the plasma supersaturation threshold for calcium oxalate), because of reduced urinary oxalate excretion. This leads to calcium oxalate deposition into nonrenal tissues including the retina, myocardium, vessel walls, skin, bone, and the central nervous system (systemic oxalosis).

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and laboratory manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PH type 2 generally have less severe disease than those with PH type 1. Patients primarily present with recurrent urolithiasis, are less likely to have nephrocalcinosis, and rarely progress to ESRD. (See <a href=\"#H60191838\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PH type 3 generally present early in life (mean age, two years) with nephrolithiasis. In contrast to the other two forms of PH, patients with PH type 3 typically do not have recurrent nephrolithiasis after six years and do not progress to ESRD. (See <a href=\"#H94201825\" class=\"local\">'Primary hyperoxaluria type 3'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnoses of PH are based on recognition of clinical findings suggestive of PH (eg, recurrent urolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis), a markedly increased urinary oxalate excretion, and confirmation by molecular genetic testing. In cases where genetic testing is negative, liver biopsy demonstrating decreased or absent activity of AGT for type 1 disease and <em>GRHPR</em> for type 2 is used to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to genetic testing, metabolic testing is useful in differentiation between types 1 and 2 PH, as urinary excretion of glycolate is strongly suggestive, but not absolutely diagnostic, of PH type 1, and patients with type 2 PH typically have elevated levels of L-glyceric acid. (See <a href=\"#H82374142\" class=\"local\">'Clinical diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H60191921\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential of PH includes secondary oxalosis due to increased oxalate intake or oxalate reabsorption due to small bowel disease. The different forms of PH are distinguished from each other and other inborn errors of oxalate and secondary causes of oxaluria by the metabolic screening and molecular testing. (See <a href=\"#H101664183\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PH should be diagnosed as soon as possible to initiate the following medical interventions to reduce calcium oxalate deposition and renal impairment in patients with type 1 and 2 PH. (See <a href=\"#H58187731\" class=\"local\">'Medical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend high fluid intake (greater than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) to decrease tubular fluid oxalate concentration and diminish intratubular oxalate deposition with a goal of urinary oxalate concentration below 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> throughout the entire 24-hour day (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend the use neutral phosphate (orthophosphate, in a dose of 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> but higher during periods of skeletal growth), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-citrate-and-citric-acid-powder-or-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium citrate-citric acid</a> (0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperoxaluria/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium oxide</a> (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> per m<sup>2</sup>) to reduce urinary calcium oxalate precipitation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with PH type 1, we recommend a three-month trial of pyridoxine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). In approximately 30 percent of patients with PH type 1, pyridoxine reduces urinary oxalate secretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with PH type 1 disease, although several transplant options (combined liver-renal transplantation, sequential liver and renal transplantation, isolated liver transplantation, and isolated renal transplantation) are currently available, it remains unclear what is the optimal approach. Until more data are available that better inform us regarding treatment choice, we perform a combination of liver-renal transplantation in patients with renal function impairment. (See <a href=\"#H58182972\" class=\"local\">'Transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with PH type 2 disease and ESRD, we suggest renal transplantation alone as the preferred procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
