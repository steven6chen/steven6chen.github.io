The structural changes include diffuse or focal destruction, sclerosis, acinar cell loss, fatty replacement, islet cell loss, inflammatory cell infiltrate, and pancreatic duct abnormalities. Intraductal obstruction may be caused by protein-plugs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calculi. Extraductal lesions such as trauma, pancreatic or hepatobiliary tumors, or surgical procedures may also lead to chronic inflammatory responses in the pancreas. </p><p>Because the pancreas has a large reserve capacity, symptoms of pancreatic failure do not develop until there is loss of over 90 percent of pancreatic exocrine function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most patients with chronic pancreatitis initially experience recurrent abdominal pain, which may progress to persistent pain. Less commonly, patients are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms until developing signs of advanced disease, such as diabetes mellitus or fat and protein malabsorption. With advances in diagnostic methods, the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is becoming more common in children.

As in adults, children may have more than one identifiable risk factor (eg, two genetic variants or a genetic variant and an anatomic abnormality). In one registry report, 21 percent of children with chronic pancreatitis had multiple risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

As in adults, children may have more than one genetic risk factor. Chronic pancreatitis has been associated with mutations in each of the following genes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>PRSS1</em></strong><strong> </strong>&ndash; Mutations in the cationic trypsinogen (serine protease 1) gene, called <em>PRSS1</em>, are present in up to 80 percent of cases of autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis. Prior to the identification of other genetic risk factors for chronic pancreatitis, this was called &quot;hereditary pancreatitis,&quot; a term which may now be confusing. Compared with other causes of chronic pancreatitis, patients with this disorder tend to present at a young age. The majority of affected individuals develop symptoms before the age of 20 years, typically at age 10 to 12 years, but often before the age of five [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The parenchyma of the pancreas is characterized by diffuse or focal infiltration or replacement by fibrotic tissue, as in chronic fibrosing pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

Of note, about one-half of patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreas divisum also have a genetic polymorphism in <em>SPINK1</em> or <em>CFTR</em>, as discussed above, suggesting that the genes act as cofactors. (See <a href=\"#H779227259\" class=\"local\">'Genetic'</a> above.) </p><p>Chronic pancreatitis has been described in association with biliary cysts (choledochal cysts), polycystic disease (which typically involves the kidney and liver but may affect the pancreas), or duplications of the pancreatic duct, stomach, or duodenum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>].

Establishing the diagnosis is important because the disease responds to glucocorticoids or immunomodulatory drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune pancreatitis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>AIP can occur as a primary pancreatic disorder or as part of multiorgan autoimmune disorders. It is usually characterized by relatively mild symptoms, with an enlarged pancreas on abdominal imaging studies, often with obstructive jaundice. The pancreatic duct usually is irregularly narrowed, although a variety of morphologies have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Adult patients with type 1 AIP often have elevated serum levels of gammaglobulin (especially IgG4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In children, serum IgG4 may not be elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Making the diagnosis is important because patients with AIP usually respond to corticosteroid therapy when treated early in the course of disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autoimmune-pancreatitis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autoimmune pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.) </p><p>Type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis is seen in association with other diseases of presumed autoimmune etiology including sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Acute and chronic pancreatitis have been described in children with inflammatory bowel disease (either Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis) and may precede the diagnosis of the bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. A common feature of these reports is the presence of colonic disease. In the setting of these diseases, the pathogenesis of the pancreatitis probably is multifactorial, including side effects of medications, but an autoimmune mechanism is also possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3734723367\"><span class=\"h1\">IDIOPATHIC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a thorough evaluation fails to identify risk factors for chronic pancreatitis, the disorder is termed &quot;idiopathic.&quot; As genetic testing has become more common, fewer cases of chronic pancreatitis fall into this category. In a large international registry, 11 percent of cases were considered idiopathic but some of these cases did not have genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Further elucidation of gene mutations associated with chronic pancreatitis may reduce the number of children diagnosed with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"#H779227259\" class=\"local\">'Genetic'</a> above.) </p><p>Two types of pancreatitis are considered &quot;idiopathic&quot; because their cause is unknown, but they are distinguished by their unique clinical features: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Idiopathic fibrosing pancreatitis</strong> &ndash; This type is characterized by fibrotic replacement of the pancreatic tissue, causing biliary obstruction and jaundice. (See <a href=\"#H1977949101\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic fibrosing pancreatitis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tropical pancreatitis</strong> &ndash; Tropical pancreatitis (also known as tropical calcific pancreatitis) is a phenotypic description of a form of chronic pancreatic seen in southern India and other parts of the tropics. Classically, it described chronic pancreatitis with an age of onset most commonly in childhood in which patients typically developed fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes, malnutrition, often culminating in early death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The histologic changes in the pancreas are similar to those of alcoholic pancreatitis, with fatty infiltration and often calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This classical presentation of tropical pancreatitis has become less frequent in the last few decades. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It was initially thought that tropical pancreatitis was the result of severe malnutrition or cassava (tapioca) ingestion. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. More recently, mutations in <em>SPINK1</em> <em>CFTR,</em> and other genes associated with Western chronic pancreatitis, have been identified in some patients with tropical pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>] (see <a href=\"#H779227259\" class=\"local\">'Genetic'</a> above). Alcohol use is also associated with tropical pancreatitis. Some investigators have suggested that tropical pancreatitis may occur through the same pathways as chronic pancreatitis in Western countries, or that there may be factors particular to the environment that trigger the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE RECURRENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute recurrent pancreatitis is a phenotypic description rather than a disease classification. Many believe that acute recurrent pancreatitis leads to chronic pancreatitis. In adults, about 70 percent of chronic pancreatitis patients had acute recurrent pancreatitis prior to receiving a diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Some patients with severe acute pancreatitis with widespread necrosis are left with scarring and duct destruction that becomes a chronic pancreatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is not a clear distinction between diseases that cause recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis and severe acute pancreatitis, and those causing chronic pancreatitis, although the distribution of risk factors is somewhat different. In a multicenter study of 155 children with acute recurrent pancreatitis, 48 percent had at least one gene associated with increased risk of pancreatitis and 33 percent had an obstructive risk factor. Toxic and metabolic risks were more common in children with acute recurrent pancreatitis than in those with chronic pancreatitis (26 versus 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-contributing-risk-factors-for-chronic-pancreatitis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21663063\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic pancreatitis can be associated with a variety of pathophysiologic mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65173\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65173 \">table 1</a>).

Imaging findings often resemble a mass in the pancreatic head. The biliary obstruction has been successfully managed by placements of stents during ERCP.
