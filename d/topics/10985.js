In addition, impure preparations of methotrexate may have played a role in some of the earlier reports of toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methotrexate-induced-lung-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Many series estimate that acute pulmonary toxicity develops in 1 to 8 percent of patients receiving methotrexate for rheumatologic condition, including rheumatoid arthritis, but some reports suggest an incidence as high as 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methotrexate-induced-lung-injury/abstract/14-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-22</a>]. On the other hand, others suggest that rates are much lower because not all cases of pneumonitis occurring in patients treated with methotrexate are directly attributable to the drug. The following examples show the frequency of pneumonitis among patients who received methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory diseases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a systematic literature review of 3463 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, 84 patients (2 percent) had some type of lung toxicity, but only 15 were felt to be definitive cases of pneumonitis attributable to methotrexate (0.43 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methotrexate-induced-lung-injury/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Adverse respiratory events were not statistically increased in those taking methotrexate; only one patient developed pneumonitis and that person was in the methotrexate group. While the data are reassuring for patients with these diseases who may take methotrexate, the relatively low total number of patients means that a small but clinically important risk cannot be completely excluded. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary complications of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> may be classified as inflammatory, infectious, and lymphoproliferative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methotrexate-induced-lung-injury/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory and fibrotic lung disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is the most common type of pulmonary toxicity associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and is characterized by a lymphocytic infiltration of the interstitium with epithelial cell hyperplasia, small, poorly formed granulomas, and sometimes eosinophilic infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methotrexate-induced-lung-injury/abstract/1-3,9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,9,17</a>].

Most researchers suggest that methotrexate pneumonitis is a form of hypersensitivity lung disease because there is typically fever, eosinophilia, an increase in CD4+ T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and a mononuclear cell infiltration of the lungs with granulomatous inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methotrexate-induced-lung-injury/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Others suggest that injury may result from a direct toxic effect of methotrexate on lung tissue, while a third theory proposes that impaired host resistance to acquired or latent viral infection (eg, cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus) underlies the observed pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methotrexate-induced-lung-injury/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. Support for direct toxicity comes from a mouse model that demonstrated alveolar epithelial injury, apoptosis, and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methotrexate-induced-lung-injury/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Finally, activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways and altered cytokine expression may contribute to the pulmonary inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methotrexate-induced-lung-injury/abstract/27,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30</a>]. </p><p>Pulmonary toxicity has occurred following both low and high doses and by a variety of routes of administration, suggesting that some of the pulmonary adverse effects may result from idiosyncratic mechanisms unrelated to folate antagonism.

However, whether methotrexate-immunosuppression has a direct effect on the malignant cells or an indirect effect via recrudescence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is not known. A portion of these cases (28 percent) are associated with EBV infection, a finding that is also seen in patients who are immunosuppressed in the setting of organ transplantation or AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methotrexate-induced-lung-injury/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Risk factors for methotrexate-induced lung toxicity include age greater than 60, rheumatoid pleuropulmonary involvement, previous use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, hypoalbuminemia, higher weekly doses of methotrexate, pre-existing lung disease, and decreased elimination of methotrexate. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Methotrexate-induced pulmonary toxicity may present in acute, subacute, or chronic forms; subacute presentations are most common. The acute presentation typically includes fever, chills, malaise, nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and chest pain; the subacute presentation is characterized by a more insidious onset of dyspnea, cough, and fever. The majority of patients who develop <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> pulmonary toxicity do so within the first year of therapy.

Up to 50 percent of patients with subacute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> lung toxicity have peripheral blood eosinophilia.
