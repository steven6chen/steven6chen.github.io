Thus, past estimates of long-term survival after CABG are of uncertain applicability to current practice. In addition, survival rates vary with the population studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The best available data on long-term survival after CABG come from two 2012 reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ASCERT study linked data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Data base and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (United States) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Fifteen-year patient survival was significantly higher with arterial grafts: 64 versus 53 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69211\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69211 \">figure 2</a>). The difference increased with time, suggesting that initial selection of an arterial graft had a more important influence on survival than progressive atherosclerosis in vessels that were not bypassed or were distal to the anastomosis. Patients with arterial grafts also tend to have fewer reoperations and a lower rate of MI or recurrent angina compared to those with SVGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Because of these and other data conclusively demonstrating a survival advantage and minimal if any excess morbidity, a left ITA to the LAD is now considered standard in all patient groups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14980327\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple arterial grafts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We individualize decision making with regard to placement of more than one arterial graft. For patients with a predicted longevity of more than 10 years who are not at high risk of sternal wound infection (obese, active smokers, those with poorly controlled IDDM, or those receiving steroid immunosuppression), placement of multiple arterial grafts, rather than one, is a reasonable choice.

Initial evidence supporting the concept that multiple arterial grafts improve long-term survival compared to a single arterial graft came from meta-analyses of observation studies. In a 2014 meta-analysis of nine studies (7313 patients with bilateral ITA [BITA] and 8270 with single ITA with at least nine years of follow-up) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. BITA was associated with a reduction in mortality (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.75-0.84). </p><p>However, a 2016 randomized trial did not find evidence of improved survival. The ART trial randomly assigned 3102 patients scheduled to undergo CABG to bilateral or single ITA grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At five years, the rate of death was not different between the two groups (8.7 versus 8.4 percent; hazard ratio 1.04, 95% CI 0.81-1.32). In addition, there was no significant difference in the rate of the composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, or stroke (12.2 versus 12.7 percent; hazard ratio 0.96, 95% CI 0.79-1.17). The rate of sternal wound complication was lower with a single graft (1.9 versus 3.5 percent [p = 0.005]), as was the rate of sternal reconstruction (0.6 versus 1.9 percent [p = 0.002]).</p><p>Total arterial revascularization reduces the incidence of early cardiac events compared to standard CABG that includes SVGs. This was illustrated in a trial of 200 patients who were randomly assigned to either total arterial or standard CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At one year, the total arterial group had significantly lower rates of recurrent angina (2 versus 13 percent for standard CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (0 versus 8 percent), and a significantly higher actuarial rate of freedom from death, MI, angina recurrence, graft occlusion, or PCI (96 versus 67 percent).

While long-term patency has been established, no study has shown higher survival rates.</p><p>The issue of whether the right internal thoracic or the radial artery is a better second arterial graft was evaluated in an observational study of 1001 patients undergoing first nonemergent CABG and who were receiving one of these two in addition to a left ITA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. SVGs were used as needed. The primary outcome was long-term overall survival and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE)-free survival, with the latter defined as a combined end point including myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac-related death, and repeat revascularization. After propensity-score matching, the following findings comparing bilateral ITA to left ITA plus radial artery were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of perioperative MACCE was lower (1.4 versus 7.6 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After a median follow-up of about 58 months, overall survival and MACCE-free survival were significantly better with bilateral ITA (hazard ratio 0.23, 95% CI 0.07-0.81 and 0.18, 95% CI 0.08-0.42, respectively). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of sternal dehiscence was similar (3.2 versus 3.6 percent).</p><p/><p>Use of the radial artery requires an evaluation for adequate ulnar artery flow to prevent the loss of hand function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].

The radial artery is particularly prone to spasm, possibly because of its large medial cross-sectional area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A variety of vasodilator agents, most commonly calcium channel blockers, have been used to prevent spasm of radial grafts after implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>If possible, radial artery grafts should be avoided in patients with chronic renal disease who are at risk for requiring dialysis.

For example, in a report from the CASS registry of patients who underwent CABG for three vessel disease, placing grafts to three or more vessels was independently associated with improved survival at five years (87 to 90 percent versus 78 percent with a graft to only one vessel) and event-free survival at six years (30 versus 23 percent with a graft to only one vessel) in patients with severe but not mild to moderate angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>The applicability of these older studies to the current era is uncertain and the effect of other confounding high-risk factors is difficult to control. </p><p>The following studies do not support an advantage to CR:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review from the BARI trial comparing CABG to PCI (bare metal stents), there was no independent survival advantage from CR compared to IR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the ARTS I trial comparing CABG to PCI (bare metal stents) in patients with multivessel disease, there was no difference in mortality out to five years in the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], despite a higher rate of CR with CABG (84 versus 71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-long-term-clinical-outcomes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

However, the above findings suggest that not all patients who undergo CABG require CR. In the setting of a left ITA conduit to the LAD, IR may be appropriate for non-LAD vessels that are small or to vessels that supply only a small amount of viable myocardium. In addition, IR, as part of a strategy to simplify the surgical procedure in order to reduce operation-related complications, may be reasonable. This may be a situation in which a combined (staged) revascularization approach, with both CABG and PCI, may be reasonable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14980586\"><span class=\"h2\">Vein graft failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The issue of whether vein graft patency affects long-term outcomes in patients who receive a left ITA graft was evaluated in the PREVENT IV trial of over 1800 patients who underwent CABG and had an angiogram performed up to 188 months after surgery.
