Reconstruction can be done using man-made materials, called &quot;implants,&quot; or using tissue taken from other parts of your body, called &quot;flaps.&quot;</p><p>If you are planning to have surgery to remove a breast, called a mastectomy, talk to your surgeon about reconstruction before you have the mastectomy. Your mastectomy might need to be done in a certain way for you to be able to have the type of reconstruction you want.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14059005\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need breast reconstruction after mastectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, you do not need it. The decision to have reconstruction is totally up to you. Some women feel better about themselves or feel more normal if they have reconstruction after mastectomy. The important thing is that you have a choice about what to do.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14059012\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I decide not to have reconstruction?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you decide not to have reconstruction, you can wear a special bra called a &quot;mastectomy bra.&quot; It has a pocket for a soft plastic breast on the side where your breast was removed. That way you'll look more even, and your clothes will probably fit better.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14059019\"><span class=\"h1\">When can I have my breast reconstructed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast reconstruction can be done at the time of mastectomy or later. The timing for you will depend on the stage of your cancer and what other treatments you need. Also, if you want to delay reconstruction for personal reasons, you can ask your doctor about doing that.</p><p>Women with early-stage cancer or who are having mastectomies to prevent cancer can have the reconstruction at the same time as their mastectomy. This is called &quot;immediate reconstruction.&quot;</p><p>Women with a later-stage or large cancer sometimes need to have radiation after mastectomy. (Radiation is a treatment that kills cancer cells or stops them from growing.) These women sometimes need to delay reconstruction until the radiation treatment is finished. This is called &quot;delayed reconstruction.&quot; The delay is needed because radiation could damage the reconstructed breast. There is also concern that an implant could keep radiation from reaching the right areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14059026\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the different ways that surgeons can reconstruct a breast?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2 main ways are with implants or with flaps. Plus, there are several kinds of flaps. The best reconstruction approach for you will depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How big your breasts are to begin with</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much extra body fat you have and where</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you are overweight or have health problems (such as diabetes or heart or lung disease)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you have had surgery before and on what part of your body, because scars might affect which tissue can be used</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14059033\"><span class=\"h1\">How does reconstruction with an implant work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A breast implant is basically a breast-shaped container that is filled with salt-water (called &quot;saline&quot;) or something that feels like Jell-O (called &quot;silicone&quot;). The implant can be inserted partly or completely under a layer of muscle in the chest.</p><p>Getting an implant usually involves 2 steps. First, the surgeon inserts a device called an &quot;expander.&quot; Often another piece of material (called &quot;ADM&quot;) is added to support the expander, and later the implant. The expander stretches the skin and muscle in the chest. The surgeon gradually adds more and more fluid to the expander until the skin and muscle are stretched enough for the size of the implant being used. Then, the surgeon does another surgery to replace the expander with the implant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69825\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69825 \">figure 1</a>). Implants are best for women with smaller breasts that don't droop.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14059040\"><span class=\"h1\">How does reconstruction with a flap work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on which type of flap is used. The most commonly used flaps are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DIEP flap</strong> &ndash; A DIEP flap is taken from the belly. It is made up of skin and fat, but not muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82619\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82619 \">figure 2</a>). Connecting these flaps to a good blood supply can be harder than for other flaps. That means the surgery can be more complicated and take longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TRAM flaps</strong> &ndash; A TRAM flap is also taken from the belly, but is made up of skin, fat, and muscle. There are 2 kinds of TRAM flaps. Both kinds of TRAM flaps can be done only in women who have enough belly fat to make a flap. After surgery, the belly looks flatter, like it does after a &quot;tummy tuck.&quot; Women who have this type of flap have a scar along their bikini line from hip to hip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When the muscle in the flap stays attached to the blood vessels that supply it, it is called a &quot;pedicled TRAM flap&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79289\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79289 \">figure 3</a>). This type of flap is tunneled under the skin from the belly to the new breast pocket.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When the flap is completely disconnected from the belly and its blood vessels, it is called a &quot;free TRAM flap&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58550\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58550 \">figure 4</a>). This type of flap is attached to a new set of blood vessels in the chest. It doesn't stay connected, so it does not have to be tunneled to its new location.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lat flap</strong> &ndash; A Lat flap is taken from the back and is made up of skin, fat, and muscle. The flap stays attached to its blood supply and is tunneled under the skin from the back to the chest. Women who have this kind of flap have a scar on their back beneath the bra line. They also often also get an implant, because there is not enough fat on the back to make a new breast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72302\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72302 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Flaps taken from other places</strong> &ndash; Women who do not have enough belly fat to make good TRAM or DIEP flaps can have flaps taken from other parts of their body. For instance, doctors sometimes take flaps from the rear end or inner thigh.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14059047\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my nipple be reconstructed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want it to be, yes. Nipple reconstruction is usually done a few months after the breast construction is done. To make a new nipple, the surgeon can rearrange the tissue that is already there or use tissue from another part of the body. Surgeons also sometimes tattoo the nipple and the area around the nipple to make it the right color.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14059054\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my new breast match my other breast?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As much as possible, yes. But the new breast will never be exactly like the breast you had before or exactly like your other breast. Plus, you won't have normal feeling (sensation) in the new breast. If you don't like the difference between them, your surgeon might be able to operate on your other breast to make them look more similar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14059061\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I choose which kind of reconstruction to have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Only some of the reconstruction types will be appropriate for you. But if you think you would rather have 1 type of reconstruction over another, ask your surgeon if that approach would work for you. He or she can tell you if your choice makes sense, and if not, why not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1867646715\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems should I watch for after surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women do not have serious problems after breast reconstruction. But there are some problems that can happen, either right after the surgery or later on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you had <strong>either type</strong> of reconstruction (implant or flap) &ndash; Problems can include infection, blood or fluid coming from the area where you had surgery, or pain that does not go away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you had an <strong>implant</strong> &ndash; The most common problem is called &quot;capsular contracture.&quot; This is when scar tissue around the implant becomes hard and tight. This can cause the breast to feel firm or sore, or change shape. Other possible problems include the implant deflating, bursting, or moving out of place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you had a <strong>flap reconstruction</strong> &ndash; In some cases, the flap does not get enough blood. This can lead the skin to change color, or the breast to feel hard. Some women can develop a bulge or hernia where the tissue was removed to make the flap.</p><p/><p>Call your doctor or nurse if you think you have any of these problems. Some of them need treatment right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14059219\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-treatment-for-early-stage-breast-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing treatment for early-stage breast cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breast-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common breast problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cancer screening (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-guide-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breast cancer guide to diagnosis and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-procedures-for-breast-cancer-mastectomy-and-breast-conserving-therapy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Surgical procedures for breast cancer &mdash; Mastectomy and breast conserving therapy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breast cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-stage-breast-cancer-treatment-in-postmenopausal-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Early-stage breast cancer treatment in postmenopausal women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-stage-breast-cancer-treatment-in-premenopausal-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Early stage breast cancer treatment in premenopausal women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-medical-therapy-for-her2-positive-breast-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adjuvant medical therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
