Despite their frequent presentation in primary care, unhealthy alcohol and other drug use often go unrecognized. Findings from clinical trials support screening of adult primary care patients followed by a brief counseling intervention for unhealthy alcohol use, but not for drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, substance abuse and substance dependence, were replaced by one diagnosis, substance use disorder, in DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

SBIRT does not appear to be efficacious for drugs other than alcohol, and it has not been sufficiently studied to determine efficacy for individuals with a moderate to severe alcohol use disorder (ie, alcohol dependence in DSM-IV). Results of clinical trials of SBIRT in settings other than primary care are mixed. </p><p>The brief intervention reviewed here is for patients identified by screening, excluding patients identified through their request for help from the primary care clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. People seeking help have a higher level of readiness and severity when compared with populations identified by screening. Screening for unhealthy use is reviewed separately.

As an example, a meta-analysis of eight trials of 2784 patients found that brief intervention decreased the proportion of patients drinking risky amounts one year later compared with patients who did not receive brief intervention (57 versus 69 percent; absolute risk reduction of 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A meta-analysis of 14 trials reported consumption outcomes for intention-to-treat participants at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Receiving brief intervention decreased patients&rsquo; drinking by an additional 3.6 standard drinks per week compared with patients not receiving brief intervention and found a similar risk difference for risky amounts (11 percent).</p><p>A clinical trial that has been used as the main basis for simulation modeling found brief intervention in this population to reduce health care utilization and result in cost savings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In that trial, 774 patients with unhealthy alcohol use identified by screening for risky drinking amounts were randomized to brief intervention or usual care in 17 primary care practices with a total of 64 physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The intervention, consisting of two 10- to 15-minute physician discussions and a nurse follow-up phone call, decreased consumption more than usual care, an effect that persisted at 36 months. Hospital use was lower over a four-year period in patients assigned to the intervention compared with patients receiving usual care (420 versus 664 days). The intervention was estimated to have saved $546 per patient in medical costs and $7780 per patient in total (including societal) costs (primarily due to a reduction in motor vehicle crashes). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114013502\"><span class=\"h3\">Inpatient care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systematic reviews of randomized trials of brief intervention for alcohol use in hospitals, including trauma services, did not find that brief intervention following screening of inpatients reduced consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

The last group had lower alcohol consumption during the 12-month follow-up period compared with the advice-only group.

In the three trials that reported the outcome, brief intervention led to decreased alcohol-related injury. Other trials, limited to patients with unhealthy use treated for traumatic injury, had mixed findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Examples of trials conducted in emergency care settings include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial randomly assigned 899 people with unhealthy alcohol use but who did not have AUDIT scores consistent with DSM-IV dependence (ie, &gt;19) to brief intervention or screening-only control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Brief intervention was associated with reduced drinking compared with the control group and with reduced driving after drinking (29 versus 42 percent) at 12 months. This trial enrolled people with heavier drinking compared with a prior, negative trial (20 to 21 versus 12 to 14 drinks per week) at the same site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], suggesting that there may be a narrow band of severity associated with response to brief intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical trial in nine emergency departments randomly assigned 1204 patients with unhealthy alcohol use to receive an educational pamphlet, brief advice, or longer counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There were no differences in unhealthy alcohol use, drinks per day, alcohol-related problems, readiness to change, or patient satisfaction at 6 or 12 months. These results suggest that the very small benefits seen in some individual efficacy trials can be lost in implementation even when done in the context of a trial.</p><p/><p>More research is needed into whether brief intervention is effective for specific subpopulations in hospital and emergency settings.

Although evidence for efficacy from individual randomized trials suggests either benefit or no benefit, but not harm, the confidence intervals from at least five alcohol screening and brief intervention trials include the possibility of harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

A brief intervention, particularly if done poorly, could lead to increased substance use. Training necessary for clinicians to do brief intervention properly is often more extensive than can be disseminated easily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].</p><p>It is possible that stigma related to substance use documented in the medical record could lead to lower quality care. Breech of the confidentiality of that information could have social consequences. Depending on local law, for example, a pregnant woman identified as using drugs could be jailed for harming the child when born, or a patient injured while drinking may be denied health insurance benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/72-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-77</a>]. </p><p>Screening and brief intervention could theoretically harm the clinician-patient relationship. In several alcohol brief intervention randomized trials, attrition has been higher in intervention groups than in control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, patients counseled for unhealthy alcohol use in an observational study perceived their quality of care to be better than those not counseled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/78-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-81</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114012816\"><span class=\"h1\">ADMINISTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although brief intervention can be delivered by different types of clinicians and non-clinicians who have been trained to do them, the best evidence for efficacy among patients identified by screening is for brief intervention done by the patient&rsquo;s primary care clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/4,5,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7-9</a>]. However, there are other options for implementing screening and brief intervention with specialized staff <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electronic support. </p><p>A meta-analysis of 52 randomized trials of alcohol brief intervention involving 29,891 patients found little evidence for differences in efficacy by clinician type or content of brief intervention.

Responsibilities can be split where a medical assistant screens patients prior to their visit with the physician, who interprets the results and does the brief intervention. </p><p>Evidence is accumulating that brief intervention done at least in part by non-physicians in primary care has similar efficacy to those done by physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other health professionals can be trained to incorporate screening and brief intervention into their roles in primary care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. This model has been used by large screening, brief intervention referral and treatment programs funded by federal grants to many states in the United States. </p><p>Employment of behavioral health specialists (eg, psychologists, social workers) in primary care settings has been advocated as a means of improving access to mental health and substance-related care. Screening and brief intervention could be part of this role, though research is needed on the efficacy of such an approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies#H71601971\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;, section on 'Primary care'</a>.)</p><p>Traditional addiction counselors may not be well suited to screening and brief intervention, at least not without additional training. In general, addiction counselors have little familiarity with patients who use alcohol and other drugs but do not have a relatively severe substance use disorder. Since the majority of patients identified by screening in primary care settings will not have a severe disorder, and since mutual help groups and other abstinence-based approaches are inappropriate and may even be counter-productive for such patients, counselors need training to reorient their approach and become familiar with a new condition. Some may find the reorientation difficult or impossible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114012830\"><span class=\"h2\">Online resources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tools for clinicians and patients have been developed to support brief intervention:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Materials addressing alcohol use at <a href=\"http://rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/&amp;token=V9NFmPZ23r34AfCpNLspaRV2zDCxILRcEzOttFB+WdSRrPiF7b7URTauVfOFGOrZ&amp;TOPIC_ID=14832\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov</a> include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A drinking diary can help patients see how much they are drinking </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A worksheet structures an accounting of pros and cons of drinking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A worksheet facilitates development of a plan for change</p><p/><p>They can easily be adapted to address drug use.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The National Institute of Drug Abuse makes available an online assessment tool based on the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test for clinicians to identify unhealthy drug use and determine level of risk (<a href=\"http://nida.nih.gov/nidamed/&amp;token=0i13p4OTjHAPEgMMyMIinuzk1/sNfWVEZxTskyrQinSvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=14832\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">nida.nih.gov/nidamed/</a>).
