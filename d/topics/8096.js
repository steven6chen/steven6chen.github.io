Hemolytic anemia refers to anemia caused by hemolysis; some patients with hemolysis in whom production of new RBCs can be increased to compensate for RBC destruction may not be anemic.</p><p>Hemolysis and hemolytic anemia can be classified in several ways, all of which are helpful in the patient evaluation and management:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intrinsic or extrinsic</strong> &ndash; Hemolysis can be caused by an <span class=\"nowrap\">intrinsic/intracorpuscular</span> property of the RBC such as an abnormal hemoglobin or membrane defect that makes the cell more susceptible to hemolysis, to an external factor such as an antibody, or both. In most cases, intrinsic defects are inherited and <span class=\"nowrap\">extrinsic/extracorpuscular</span> defects are acquired. Drug-induced hemolysis is an extrinsic form of hemolysis, but in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, an intrinsic RBC enzyme defect hemolysis can be dramatically increased in the setting of exposure to an oxidant drug.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immune or non-immune</strong> &ndash; Hemolysis can be immune or non-immune. Immune hemolysis is caused by autoantibody mediated destruction of RBCs, termed autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). AIHA in turn can be classified by the temperature at which the antibody destroys the cells. Warm AIHA, in which hemolysis occurs at body temperature, is most commonly seen. Cold AIHA, also called cold agglutinin disease, results from antibodies to RBC antigens that occasionally develop in the setting of specific infections. In contrast, non-immune hemolysis is due to a mechanism that does not involve antibodies. Drug-induced hemolysis can be immune, when a drug induces formation of drug-dependent autoantibodies, or non-immune, when a drug causes oxidant injury. Other mechanisms exist, some of which remain poorly understood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intravascular or extravascular</strong> &ndash; Hemolysis can occur in the intravascular space (ie, in the circulation) or extravascularly (in the liver and spleen). Intravascular hemolysis is associated with liberation of hemoglobin into the circulation, which can cause significant morbidity from renal failure and even disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). In severe cases, there may be both intravascular and extravascular components.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3333556037\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF DRUG-INDUCED HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two major mechanisms of drug-induced hemolytic anemia involve drug-induced antibody-mediated red blood cell (RBC) destruction and drug-induced oxidative hemolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3669117604\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug-induced oxidative hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal RBCs have a substantial potential to undergo auto-oxidative destruction. Each RBC contains hemoglobin-bound heme at a concentration of 20 mM, most of which is bonded to oxygen by the ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) atom in heme. During the formation of oxyhemoglobin from deoxyhemoglobin and molecular oxygen, one electron is partially transferred from heme iron to the bound oxygen, forming a ferric-superoxide anion complex (Fe<sup>3+</sup>&mdash;O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>). During deoxygenation, most of the oxygen leaves the molecule as molecular oxygen, but a small amount leaves as a superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) radical. The partially transferred electron in superoxide is not returned to the iron moiety, leaving the iron in the ferric state and forming methemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>HbFe<sup>2+</sup>O<sub>2</sub> &#160; &mdash;&gt; &#160; HbFe<sup>3+</sup> &#160; + &#160; O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup></p></div></div><p>Normally, auto-oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin occurs spontaneously at a slow rate, converting 0.5 to 3 percent of the available hemoglobin to methemoglobin per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Methemoglobin is then reduced back to hemoglobin, predominantly through the NADH-dependent reaction catalyzed by cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-methemoglobinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and pathogenesis of methemoglobinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another important pathway protecting RBCs against oxidative injury via the production of NADPH is the hexose monophosphate shunt. RBCs contain relatively high concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH), a sulfhydryl-containing tripeptide that functions as an intracellular reducing agent. Under normal circumstances, GSH in conjunction with glutathione peroxidase rapidly inactivates methemoglobin. These reactions result in the conversion of GSH to oxidized glutathione (GSSG). GSH levels are restored by glutathione reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of GSSG to GSH. This reaction requires the NADPH generated by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77081\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77081 \">figure 1</a>). As a result, patients with G6PD deficiency are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis by a number of drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74254 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency&quot;, section on 'Inciting drugs, foods, illnesses'</a>.)</p><p>At steady-state levels, methemoglobin accounts for approximately1 percent of total hemoglobin. Exogenous compounds including many of the drugs described below may oxidize hemoglobin to methemoglobin directly, by means of a metabolic derivative, or by generating O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during their metabolism.</p><p>The ferric heme molecules in methemoglobin are unable to bind oxygen. In addition, the accompanying ferrous hemes in the hemoglobin tetramer have increased affinity for oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As a result, the oxygen dissociation curve is left-shifted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 2</a>) and oxygen delivery to the tissues is impaired. Methemoglobin is not directly harmful to red cells. However, if there is a large oxidative assault, methemoglobin is converted to hemichromes (variably denatured hemoglobin intermediates). Continued oxidation results in irreversible hemichrome oxidation, precipitation, and eventually the formation of Heinz bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790 \">picture 1</a>). Removal of membrane-attached Heinz bodies via the monocyte-macrophage system in the spleen can produce bite cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Hemichromes are an important source of RBC injury in a number of hemolytic states, including the thalassemias and the unstable hemoglobin variants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of beta thalassemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unstable-hemoglobin-variants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unstable hemoglobin variants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oxidative denaturation of hemoglobin also leads to its cross-bonding. As a result, hemoglobin is no longer free to flow in the cytosol of the RBC. This in turn results in the puddling of hemoglobin on one side of the cell and an empty veil of membrane on the other side, producing bite cells or hemiblister cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The third most abundant protein in the red cell is peroxiredoxin 2, an enzyme that competes with catalase and glutathione peroxidase in removing hydrogen peroxide. No human disorder related to deficiency of this enzyme has been identified thus far, but mice deficient in this protein develop a Heinz-body hemolytic anemia, which becomes apparent as they age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The oxidative attack is directed at both hemoglobin (where methemoglobin may account for as much as 50 to 60 percent of total hemoglobin) and the red cell membrane. However, these sites may not be easily separable because some of the precipitated hemichromes and Heinz bodies lie against the cytosolic face of the membrane. The hemichromes by themselves, or their iron portions acting as a Fenton reagent, mediate the generation of hydroxyl free radicals, which add their effect to that of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide via the following reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &#160;+ &#160;Fe<sup>2+</sup> &#160; &mdash;&gt; &#160; OH<sup>-</sup> &#160;+ &#160;Fe<sup>3+</sup> &#160;+ &#160;OH<sup>&bull;</sup> (hydroxyl radical)<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> (superoxide anion) &#160;+ &#160;Fe<sup>3+</sup> &#160; &mdash;&gt; &#160; O<sub>2</sub> &#160;+ &#160;Fe<sup>2+</sup></p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p><strong>SUM:</strong> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> &#160;+ &#160;O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> &#160; &mdash;&gt; &#160; O<sub>2</sub> &#160;+ &#160;OH<sup>-</sup> &#160;+ &#160;OH<sup>&bull;</sup></p></div></div><p>Oxidative injury can also lead to lipid peroxidation, crosslinking of membrane proteins, and the formation of adducts between spectrin and denatured globin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Hemichromes and Heinz bodies (denatured hemoglobin intermediates and precipitated forms, respectively) can interfere with membrane function both directly or via oxidation of membrane proteins and lipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unstable-hemoglobin-variants#H11446176\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unstable hemoglobin variants&quot;, section on 'Hemoglobin precipitation and Heinz body formation'</a>.)</p><p>These erythrocytes also have decreased deformability, a characteristic that promotes trapping in the spleen and in other sinusoidal structures. This trapping can occur regardless of whether Heinz bodies are located against the membrane. Susceptibility to phagocytosis by macrophages may also be increased. These features may account for the extravascular destruction of RBCs. In some cases, however, the oxidative lesions are so severe that there is also intravascular hemolysis, with hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria.</p><p>Other mechanisms such as in drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy are discussed separately.

Once the drug is stopped, hemolysis diminishes rapidly, the rate depending upon the clearance of the drug.</p><p>The direct Coombs test in the immune complex type of drug-induced AIHA is usually positive with anti-C3 antisera but negative with anti-IgG antisera. The indirect antiglobulin test is positive only if the drug and a source of complement are added to the reaction mixture; under those conditions, the red cells have C3 on the surface but IgG is not detected. The antibody may also be detected by its ability to immunologically hemolyze the red cells; this hemolysis may be increased by using the red cells of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.</p><p>For many years, it was thought that the drug did not react with the red cell and that the red cell was an &quot;innocent bystander.&quot; It is now thought that the reaction is a typical haptene reaction in which the drug forms a loose complex with a membrane glycoprotein (the Rh complex in many cases); the epitope is comprised of both components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemolytic-anemia-due-to-drugs-and-toxins/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].
