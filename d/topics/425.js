The median age at diagnosis is 71. Approximately 70 percent of cases develop over the age of 65; 40 percent are 75 years or older. The United States Census bureau projects that by the year 2030 the number of Americans over age 65 will double [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result, the number of patients over the age of 70 presenting for colorectal cancer care is expected to rise.</p><p>Surgical resection is the only curative treatment for locoregional colon cancer, and outcome is most closely related to the extent of disease at presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81414\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81414 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

However, for older patients, who may have age-related organ function decline and comorbid conditions that may limit life expectancy, special attention must be paid to the risks of chemotherapy, including both treatment-related toxicity and quality of life issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Age-related organ function decline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging is commonly accompanied by a decline in the function of critical organ system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Liver/renal</span> function &ndash; Declining liver and kidney function with age can alter cancer drug metabolism and elimination. Of the drugs commonly used in the adjuvant setting to treat colon cancer, only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> is predominately cleared by the kidney.

Chemotherapy dose reduction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delay may be necessary.</p><p/><p>Another alternative is the use of hematopoietic growth factor support during treatment. However, there is no role for primary prophylaxis with myeloid growth factors. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) support primary prophylaxis with myeloid growth factors only for chemotherapy regimens that have a risk of febrile neutropenia &ge;20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Of these, liver and kidney disease place patients at greatest risk of noncancer-related death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Among patients undergoing surgery for colon cancer, severe comorbidity increases the complexity of cancer management, and it decreases both overall and cancer-specific survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79620\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79620 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>For seriously ill patients with severe comorbid illness that diminishes life expectancy (particularly to one year or less), the risks of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon cancer may outweigh its benefits. On the other hand, for patients who have multiple but not life-threatening comorbid conditions, the benefits of adjuvant therapy appear to be preserved without an increased risk of severe chemotherapy toxicity or hospitalization during adjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Several comorbidity indices are available, and all appear useful for predicting which patients are likely to have lower levels of overall and cancer-specific survival after colon cancer surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One such tool, the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72047 \">table 4</a>). In one series, patients with a CCI of &ge;3 had a significant twofold higher risk of colon cancer-specific mortality, and a CCI of 2 or higher was associated with a significant 1.49-fold higher rate of overall mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The available data suggest that older patients are just as willing to try chemotherapy as their younger counterparts, but less willing to endure severe treatment-related side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in elderly persons&quot;, section on 'Quality of life issues'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Measures of physical function and reserve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronological age is a poor marker of a patient's functional status. Several methods of functional assessment are available, but there is no single valid measure that is both feasible in routine clinical practice, and can reliably predict <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> improve outcomes of older patients.

There are two widely used scales, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 5</a>) and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 6</a>).</p><p/><p>PS tends to underestimate the degree of functional impairment in the older patient. However, both the ECOG PS and KPS are useful to assess a patient's ability to tolerate chemotherapy. Regardless of age, patients with a poor PS (eg, ECOG PS &gt;2, KPS &lt;60) usually tolerate chemotherapy poorly.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ADL and IADL scales &ndash; A more comprehensive understanding of an older patient's functional state can be obtained by use of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales. ADL refers to the skills that are necessary for basic living, and include feeding, grooming, transferring, and toileting. IADL refers to the skills required to live independently in the community, including shopping, managing finances, housekeeping, preparing meals, and the ability to take medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comprehensive geriatric assessment &ndash; Assessment of functional status with the ADL and IADL scales is a component of the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) that is used by geriatricians to identify frail older patients at high risk of adverse outcomes such as falls, hospitalization, and death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frailty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frailty&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Incorporating a thorough geriatric assessment of function using the CGA can aid treatment decision-making in older cancer patients. There is no uniform CGA measurement tool, but all include some multidisciplinary assessment of the following domains: physical function, comorbid conditions, psychological state, social support, cognitive function, nutrition, and polypharmacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68620\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68620 \">table 7</a>).

Parameters included within this model include age, type of cancer, the proposed chemotherapy regimen, renal and hematologic function, hearing, and activity levels from the comprehensive geriatric assessment (ability to take medications, physical activity, social activity).

Almost all of the trials demonstrating the benefits of chemotherapy were conducted in both stage II and III disease but almost without exception, the survival benefits were limited to stage III disease. Although adjuvant chemotherapy is routinely offered to patients with higher-risk stage II disease (fewer than 13 lymph nodes in the surgical specimen, a T4 primary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>), perforation, lymphovascular or neural invasion, poorly differentiated histology), there are no data that support the view that these features identify those patients with stage II disease who might derive relatively greater benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. In fact, at least some data from the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results <span class=\"nowrap\">(SEER)/Medicare</span> database indicate that adjuvant chemotherapy does not substantially improve overall survival in patients over the age of 65 with stage II colon cancer, with or without any of these poor prognostic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

However, the survival and disease-free survival (DFS) benefit was limited to stage III disease. In an exploratory analysis there was an absolute difference in five-year DFS that favored FOLFOX in the subgroup of stage II patients with high-risk tumors, but it was not statistically significant (82 versus 75 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.72) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The optimal duration of oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant therapy is evolving. Based upon preliminary results from the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) collaboration (six randomized trials of six versus three months of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy) reported at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], we continue to suggest six months of oxaliplatin-based therapy for individuals with high-risk stage III disease (T4N1 or N2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>)). On the other hand, given the small predicted loss of DFS benefit (absolute difference 0.2 percent at three years) and the significantly lower rates of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> neuropathy, it seems reasonable to limit adjuvant therapy to three months in patients with low-risk disease (T1-3,N1), which makes up about 60 percent of all stage III colon cancers. However, the data from the IDEA collaboration are preliminary, and overall survival results are not yet mature. In the interim, patients with lower-risk stage III cancers who place a high value on minimizing their risk of a disease recurrence may still choose six months of adjuvant therapy, with oxaliplatin doses modified based upon neurotoxicity. If three months of adjuvant therapy is chosen, subset analysis of the IDEA collaboration suggests that oxaliplatin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> may be a better choice than oxaliplatin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> and short-term infusional FU (although this was not a randomized comparison in any of the six trials), and it avoids the need for an ambulatory infusion pump. Whether these data can be extrapolated to high-risk stage II disease is unclear. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere.
