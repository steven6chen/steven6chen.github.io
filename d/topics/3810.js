Bicuspid aortic valve typically occurs sporadically, but may occur as an autosomal dominant inherited disorder with variable penetrance. It may occur as an isolated lesion or associated with other congenital cardiovascular defects or aortopathy syndromes. A bicuspid aortic valve may develop significant aortic regurgitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stenosis and is at risk for infective endocarditis. Bicuspid aortic valve patients often have aortic root <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ascending aortic dilatation, with the prevalence of aortic enlargement increasing with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Bicuspid aortic valve is a risk factor for aortic aneurysm and acute aortic dissection, which is related to underlying aortopathy, cystic medial degeneration, and hemodynamic factors.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical presentation and diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve. Treatment of patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease is discussed separately.

A raphe or fibrous ridge is the site of fusion of the two conjoined cusps and is identifiable in most cases. There is a wide spectrum of bicuspid aortic valves, including partial or complete leaflet fusion, the presence or absence of a raphe or multiple raphes, and different orientations of the true commissures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The right and left coronary leaflets are the most commonly fused (70 to 86 percent) with the true commissures oriented in anterior-posterior position (typical pattern). Right and noncoronary leaflet fusion with right-left leaflet orientation (atypical pattern) occurs in 12 percent, while left and noncoronary leaflet fusion (3 percent) is the least common type of bicuspid aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The coronary arteries usually arise in front of the cusps in which a raphe is present.</p><p>Leaflet orientation may affect valve function with fusion of the right and noncoronary leaflet associated with greater valvular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Leaflet orientation may also predict the pattern of aortopathy and is associated with differential regional aortic wall stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19286711\" class=\"local\">'Aortic dilation and aortic dissection'</a> below.)</p><p>Calcification of the bicuspid aortic valve increases with age and occurs more rapidly than that seen with tricuspid aortic valve. There is abnormal leaflet motion and turbulence during the cardiac cycle in bicuspid aortic valves and this may play a role in premature degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22208366\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of the bicuspid aortic valve has been estimated at approximately 1 percent of the population, with a 2 to 3:1 male to female ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A necropsy series of 21,417 cases reported 293 bicuspid valves (prevalence 1.37 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Of 20,946 military recruits, the prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve was 0.8 percent by echocardiographic survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There are groups with a higher prevalence of bicuspid aortic valves, including up to 50 percent of patients with coarctation of the aorta and 30 percent of Turner syndrome females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22208373\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3305763\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large family studies have found a prevalence of a bicuspid aortic valve to be approximately 9 percent in first degree relatives of the individual with a bicuspid aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The heritability of bicuspid aortic valve has been estimated as 89 percent, suggesting that most cases are familial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Inheritance patterns for familial bicuspid aortic valve with ascending aortic aneurysm are also consistent with an autosomal dominant pattern with reduced penetrance and there is variable expressivity so some family members have an isolated bicuspid aortic valve, some have an ascending aortic aneurysm, some have both, and some carriers have no manifest disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, careful screening of the aortic valve and ascending aorta is necessary for first degree relatives of patients with bicuspid aortic valve or premature thoracic aortic aneurysm, as recommended below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/1,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12,13</a>].</p><p>When faced with the patient with a bicuspid aortic valve and ascending aortic aneurysm, one must consider whether the aortic aneurysm is related to the bicuspid aortic valve alone (bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy) or whether it is related to another disease or aneurysm syndrome (such as bicuspid aortic valve with thoracic aortic aneurysm or other syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Bicuspid aortic valve disease has been linked to a mutation on chromosome 9q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] as well as to potential loci at 5q, 13q, 15q, and 18q in individuals with familial bicuspid aortic valve and aneurysm syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].</p><p>Other syndromes associated with bicuspid aortic valve and ascending aortic aneurysm include Turner syndrome (bicuspid valve present in approximately 30 percent), Loeys-Dietz syndrome (due to mutations in <em>TGFBR1</em> and <em>TGFBR2</em>; bicuspid valve reported in 2.5 to 17 percent), and familial thoracic aortic aneurysm syndrome due to <em>ACTA2</em> mutations (bicuspid aortic valve reported in 3 percent) and <em>MAT2A</em> mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83657\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83657 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3305756\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend screening of first degree relatives for bicuspid aortic valve (and aortic root and ascending aorta dilation) as recommended in the 2008 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> adult congenital heart disease guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Similarly, the 2010 guidelines for management of patients with thoracic aortic disease recommend evaluation of first-degree relative of patients with bicuspid aortic valve, premature onset of thoracic aortic disease with minimal risk factors, <strong><span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</strong></span> a familial form of thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection for the presence of a bicuspid aortic valve and asymptomatic thoracic aortic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> valvular heart disease guidelines note that screening of first-degree relatives is clearly appropriate if the patient with bicuspid aortic valve has associated aortopathy or family history of valvular heart disease or aortopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> guidelines note that many valve experts also recommend screening of all first degree relative of patients with bicuspid aortic valve but data are lacking on the impact of screening on outcomes and on the cost-effectiveness of this approach. </p><p>Screening is generally performed by echocardiography and should include assessment of the aortic root and ascending aorta. A study of echocardiography screening of 207 siblings (median age seven years) of 181 children with bicuspid valve found bicuspid aortic valve in 10 percent of siblings screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When performing screening, it is important to visualize the ascending aorta. If the ascending aorta is not well seen by echocardiogram, then CT or MRA is recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22208380\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED CARDIOVASCULAR LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bicuspid aortic valve may exist alone or associated with other congenital cardiovascular and aortic disorders. These include coarctation of the aorta, supravalvular aortic stenosis, subvalvular aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], patent ductus arteriosus, and sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83657\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83657 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Turner syndrome is due to complete or partial absence of one X chromosome and is commonly associated with bicuspid aortic valve (approximately 30 percent) and other cardiovascular defects (coarctation of the aorta, elongated aortic arch, partial anomalous pulmonary venous return) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with Turner syndrome are at increased risk of aortic dissection and criteria for prophylactic surgery to replace the dilated aortic root are adjusted for the small body surface area of Turner women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

With progressive aortic stenosis, the ejection murmur becomes harsher and later peaking and the ejection sound diminishes or becomes inaudible. When aortic regurgitation is present, a diastolic decrescendo murmur is heard best at the left lower sternal border. When the aortic regurgitation murmur is loudest at the right midsternal border, a dilated ascending aorta may be present.

When aortic aneurysm is present, especially involving the aortic root, it is important to evaluate the patient for features of an underlying aortopathy syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Findings of a bicuspid aortic valve include: systolic doming, eccentric valve closure, leaflet redundancy, leaflet prolapse, presence of a raphe, elliptical orifice of valve during systole, distinct opening pattern, and a dilated aortic root or ascending aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One must evaluate the valve carefully in systole, as a raphe may simulate a trileaflet appearance during diastole. The finding of eccentric valve closure has limited sensitivity and specificity since up to 25 percent of bicuspid aortic valves do not demonstrate eccentric valve closure and some tricuspid aortic valves show eccentric closure. </p><p>When unexplained aortic dilatation is discovered and bicuspid aortic valve disease is not completely excluded by transthoracic echocardiogram, transesophageal echocardiogram or cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) may be very useful in diagnosing or excluding an underlying bicuspid aortic valve. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2969923268\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transthoracic echocardiogram has a sensitivity and specificity for detecting bicuspid aortic valve as high as 92 and 96 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When significant calcification and stenosis complicate the bicuspid valve, it may be difficult to discern the valve leaflet number accurately. By the time aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis is required, the accuracy of the transthoracic echocardiogram for discerning leaflet number is substantially less. In a study of 100 patients (mean age 70 years) with aortic stenosis undergoing aortic valve replacement, the echocardiogram was considered interpretable in 86 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Congenitally malformed valves were present in 44 patients and tricuspid valves in 42 patients. Valve structure was concordant by echocardiogram in 57 of 86 cases (66 percent). </p><p>Echocardiography generally establishes the diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve and also provides an evaluation of aortic valve dysfunction and associated lesions. Patients with bicuspid aortic valve should undergo primary imaging by Doppler echocardiography, including assessment of any aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation and measurement of aortic root and ascending aorta diameters, as recommended by the 2008 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> adult congenital heart disease guidelines as well as the 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> valve disease guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/18,19,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,28</a>]. The echocardiogram should also assess any coexistent lesions such as dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta, septal defects, and coarctation of the aorta. </p><p>Transesophageal echocardiogram is not generally required to diagnose bicuspid aortic valve but when performed has a high sensitivity of detecting the bicuspid aortic valve (approaching 100 percent) unless significant valvular calcification is present, which lowers the accuracy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1026135\"><span class=\"h2\">Other imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) or CMR are recommended for evaluating the size and anatomy of the aortic root and ascending aorta when these cannot be adequately assessed by echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p>Since echocardiography is generally diagnostic, other imaging modalities are rarely needed to examine the bicuspid aortic valve itself. When performed, multidetector CT (MDCT) and MRI have high accuracy for diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve (sensitivity and specificity of 94 and 100 percent for MDCT and 100 and 95 percent for MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>MRI can be helpful for assessment of the regurgitant volume when quantification of aortic regurgitation by echocardiography is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

There are different definitions of what degree of aortic enlargement is necessary to be considered an aneurysm, one being an enlargement of the aorta segment at least 50 percent greater than that expected for an unaffected individual of the same age and gender. Women have smaller aortic diameters than men and it is important to consider age, gender, and body surface area in determining the significance of the aortic size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A true aneurysm involves all three layers of the arterial wall. It is important to obtain an accurate measurement of the aorta perpendicular to the long axis of blood flow or using double oblique techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Since varying criteria have been used to identify thoracic aortic aneurysm, recommendations for monitoring and treatment of aortic disease generally include specific numeric thresholds for aortic diameter.

Of the 38 patients with pure aortic regurgitation, the aortic media was normal in 53 percent and abnormal in 47 percent.</p><p>Alterations in mechanical properties of the aorta have been observed in bicuspid aortic valve patients. Patients with bicuspid aortic valve have reduced aortic elasticity and distensibility, as demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. First degree relatives of the patient with bicuspid aortic valve and aortic aneurysm may also have abnormal aortic elastic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>There is increasing evidence in support of abnormal hemodynamic effects and associated regional aortic wall shear stress from bicuspid aortic valve flow patterns as an underlying cause for bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy and possibly the various aortic phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p>The bicuspid aortic valve exhibits abnormal leaflet folding, wrinkling, and increased leaflet doming, which can result in turbulence even in the absence of a stenotic lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The aortic curvature and regions of turbulent flow may also play a role. Markedly abnormal helical flow patterns in the ascending aorta of patients with bicuspid aortic valve with and without aortic aneurysms have been demonstrated, and this abnormal helical flow correlates with abnormal wall shear stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/1,2,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,60</a>]. Further studies examining aneurysmal aortic tissue from sites of increased wall shear stress document a strong correlation between elevated regional wall shear stress and greater degrees of cystic medial degeneration, increased matrix metalloproteinase activity, and increased TGF-beta expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3306429\"><span class=\"h3\">Impact of coarctation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a series of 622 adult patients with bicuspid aortic valve (mean age 32 years) followed during the period 1989 to 2006, the prevalence of ascending aortic complications (aneurysm &gt;55 mm aortic dissection or rupture) was 8 percent in patients with bicuspid aortic valve plus coarctation versus 4 percent in patients with bicuspid aortic valve alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Among the 341 patients with a bicuspid aortic valve and no baseline aortic complications who were followed for a median of seven years, the incidence of developing complications was significantly higher in the group with coarctation of the aorta (130 versus 20 per 10,000 patient-years; hazard ratio 7.5, 95% CI 2.0-28).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H656577826\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

There is a 2 to 3:1 male predominance. (See <a href=\"#H22208366\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve is generally established by transthoracic echocardiography. Echocardiographic features include systolic doming, eccentric valve closure, presence of a raphe, elliptical opening, and a dilated ascending aorta. It is important to determine leaflet number and appearance in systole since a raphe can simulate a trileaflet appearance in diastole. (See <a href=\"#H1026128\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bicuspid aortic valve is usually sporadic, but may be inherited as an autosomal dominant condition with incomplete penetrance and may be a component of an underlying thoracic aortic aneurysm syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H22208373\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ascending aorta in bicuspid aortic valve disease should be completely visualized by echocardiogram (and MRI or CT if necessary) to evaluate for associated aortopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiographic screening of first degree relatives of the patient with a bicuspid valve is recommended, especially if the patient with bicuspid valve has associated aortopathy or a family history of valvular heart disease or aortopathy. (See <a href=\"#H3305756\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with bicuspid aortic valve develop significant aortic stenosis much more frequently than significant aortic regurgitation and are at risk for infective endocarditis. (See <a href=\"#H22208401\" class=\"local\">'Valve disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with bicuspid aortic valve are at risk for aortic dilation (most commonly involving the ascending aorta) and aortic dissection. These aortic complications are caused by an underlying aortopathy with cystic medial degeneration as well as hemodynamic factors and abnormal aortic wall shear stress. (See <a href=\"#H19286711\" class=\"local\">'Aortic dilation and aortic dissection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H96373955\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology of aortic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bicuspid aortic valve is frequently associated with other congenital cardiovascular defects, including coarctation of the aorta, supravalvular aortic stenosis, subvalvular aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect, and sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. The combination of bicuspid aortic valve and coarctation of the aorta is associated with high risk of aortic complications. (See <a href=\"#H22208380\" class=\"local\">'Associated cardiovascular lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516719592\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would&nbsp;like to thank Drs.
