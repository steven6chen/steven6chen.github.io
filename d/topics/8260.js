The elderly have weaker bone and are more likely to fall due to poorer balance, medication side effects, and difficulty maneuvering around environmental hazards. Clinicians in many fields are involved in caring for patients with hip fractures and should be familiar with the basic assessment and management of these injuries.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the major types of hip fractures, including basic anatomy, fracture classification, and clinical and radiographic assessment. The details of surgical treatment are beyond the scope of this review. Prevention of hip fractures, preoperative assessment and the prevention and management of common medical complications associated with hip fractures are all discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical consultation for patients with hip fracture&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worldwide, the total number of hip fractures is expected to surpass 6 million by the year 2050 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A total of 310,000 individuals were hospitalized with hip fractures in the United States alone in 2003, according to data from the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), accounting for 30 percent of all hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately one-third (101,800) of fracture patients went on to receive a hip replacement. The estimated cost for treatment is approximately 10.3 to 15.2 billion dollars per year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. From 1996 to 2010, there was a decline in the incidence of hip fractures in the Unites States with a total of 258,000 recorded for hospitalized patients. While the reasons are not entirely clear, possible explanations include the release of several bisphosphonates as well as lifestyle changes that include an increased focus on calcium and vitamin D supplementation, avoidance of smoking, moderation of alcohol use, awareness of falls, and regular weightbearing exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Hip fractures substantially increase the risk of death and major morbidity in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. These risks are especially high among nursing home residents, particularly men, patients over age 90, those with cognitive impairment and other comorbidities, individuals treated nonoperatively, and those who cannot ambulate independently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In-hospital mortality rates range from approximately 1 to 10 percent depending upon the location and patient characteristics, but rates are typically higher in men, although this discrepancy appears to be declining in some areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. One-year mortality rates have ranged from 12 to 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3,9,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,18,19</a>], but may be declining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Approximately one-half of patients are unable to regain their ability to live independently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A meta-analysis of prospective studies found the relative hazard for mortality during the first three months following a hip fracture to be 5.75 (95% CI 4.94-6.67) in older women and 7.95 (95% CI 6.13-10.30) in older men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although it decreases over time, the increased risk of death likely persists, according to this review and other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, one large prospective case-control study found no increased risk of mortality after the first year following a hip fracture among women 70 years or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>A large review of hip fractures in the United States found that femoral neck and intertrochanteric fractures occur with approximately the same frequency in patients between the ages of 65 and 99 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Intracapsular (ie, femoral neck) fractures occur about three times more often in women. The highest rates were found among white women. Intertrochanteric extracapsular fractures also occur in a 3:1 female to male ratio. Subtrochanteric fractures show a bimodal distribution (20 to 40 years and over 60 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Isolated trochanteric fractures occur more often in young, active adults between the ages of 14 and 25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Eighty-five percent of less severe trochanteric avulsion fractures occur in patients under 20 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Trochanteric fractures in elderly patients usually result from direct trauma (eg, fall), but can be associated with pathologic injury (eg, fracture through bone metastases).

It is estimated that approximately 30 to 60 percent of community-dwelling older adults fall each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Approximately 90 percent of hip fractures in the elderly occur from a simple fall from the standing position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Women sustain hip fractures more often due to their higher rates of osteoporosis. The lifetime risk of hip fracture is 17.5 percent for women and 6 percent for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. On average, women who sustain a femoral neck fracture are 77 years old and men are 72 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Low socioeconomic status is associated with an increased incidence of hip fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Cardiovascular disease may also be associated with an increase in the risk of hip fracture among older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], as may some endocrine disorders (eg, diabetes, hyperthyroidism), and a number of medications that increase the likelihood of falling (eg, benzodiazepines, opioids, antidepressants) or weaken bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Patients with a low BMI (&lt;22) appear to be at higher risk of hip fracture compared with those with a higher BMI (22 to 25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. While fracture risk levels off at BMIs of 25 or more in younger individuals, among women age 70 to 79 the risk of hip fracture continues to decrease with increasing BMI.

These issues, including fall prevention and the treatment of osteoporosis, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-prevention-in-community-dwelling-older-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls: Prevention in community-dwelling older persons&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-fracture-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic fracture risk assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hip joint is a &quot;ball and socket&quot; joint consisting of the acetabulum (socket) and the femoral head (ball) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90460 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75798 \">picture 2</a>). The femoral neck connects the femoral head to the proximal portion of the femoral shaft and attaches to the intertrochanteric region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54598\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54598 \">figure 1</a>). The term &quot;hip fracture&quot; is applied to fractures in any of these locations.</p><p>Disruption of the blood supply to the head and neck of the femur can impair fracture healing in these structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74955 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59744\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59744 \">figure 3</a>). An extracapsular vascular ring encircles the base of the femoral neck. This ring gives rise to feeder vessels (ascending cervical arteries) that run parallel to the femoral neck up to the femoral head. The arteries of this ring are supplied by the medial and lateral femoral circumflex arteries, which arise from the deep femoral artery. The foveal artery (a branch of the obturator artery) provides supplementary blood flow to the femoral head. It courses through the ligamentum teres into the fovea. However, the foveal artery alone is not thought to be adequate to meet the needs of the femoral head.</p><p>The femoral head is a sphere that is slightly flattened superiorly. The arrangement of its cancellous bone is oriented along the principal lines of stress. Most important of these arrangements are the primary medial trabeculae (which resist compression) and the primary lateral trabeculae (which resist tension). These structures enable the bone to endure the strong forces exerted across the proximal femur. As an example, a force 2.6 times body weight is transmitted across the hip in a one-legged stance.</p><p>The prognosis of hip fractures varies by anatomic location. The intertrochanteric region contains a large amount of cancellous bone with a good blood supply. Therefore, intertrochanteric fractures typically heal well if reduction and fixation are properly performed. However, intertrochanteric fractures can become displaced because of the actions of the iliopsoas muscle, which pulls on the lesser trochanter, and the major external rotator and abductor muscles of the hip, which pull on the greater trochanter.</p><p>In contrast to the intertrochanteric region, the femoral neck has little cancellous bone, a thin periosteum, and a relatively poor blood supply that can be disrupted by injury. Fractures in this area have a higher incidence of complications, such as avascular necrosis and degenerative changes in the femoral head.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">FRACTURE CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hip fractures are classified by anatomic location and by fracture type. The general categories include intracapsular (femoral neck and head) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75798\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75798 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55859\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55859 \">figure 4</a>) and extracapsular (intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54598\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54598 \">figure 1</a>) fractures. Extracapsular is defined as extending from the extracapsular femoral neck to the area just distal to the lesser trochanter.</p><p>For reasons discussed above, intracapsular fractures have a higher rate of nonunion or malunion and are more likely to lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head. Subtrochanteric fractures have an increased need for implant devices, such as intramedullary nails (or rods) and have higher rates of implant failure due to the high stresses placed upon this part of the femur. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic considerations'</a> above.)</p><p>Distinct classification schemes for femoral neck fractures and intertrochanteric fractures are described below. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Femoral neck fractures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Intertrochanteric fractures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial care of the patient with a hip fracture consists primarily of providing adequate analgesia and consulting an orthopedic surgeon. Pain is often undertreated in the elderly, which is inhumane and increases the risk of delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Intravenous opioids provide faster relief, but intramuscular or oral medications may be used. If resources are available, regional nerve blocks are highly effective at reducing pain and minimizing the sedation and other potential complications caused by opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity nerve blocks: Techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients at higher risk for hemorrhage, it is prudent to obtain blood for type and screen or type and crossmatch at the time of presentation. According to retrospective studies, patients at higher risk have at least two of the following features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age over 75 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial hemoglobin below 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (SI 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritrochanteric fracture</p><p/><p>Comorbidities (eg, ischemic heart disease) must be considered when determining the need for blood transfusion or other interventions.

Conditions associated with the fracture may include dehydration, possibly complicated by rhabdomyolysis due to prolonged down time.

The tenuous blood supply to the femoral neck increases the risk of complications, such as avascular necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74955 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59744\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59744 \">figure 3</a>). The presence of a fracture-dislocation further increases such risks. Hip anatomy is discussed in greater detail above.

Among the elderly, there are several possible mechanisms of injury:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fall directly onto the lateral hip</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A twisting mechanism in which the patient's foot is planted and the body rotates</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sudden spontaneous completion of a fatigue (or insufficiency) fracture, which then causes a fall</p><p/><p>In younger individuals, femoral neck fractures generally occur as a result of major trauma, such as a motor vehicle collision or a fall from a height. The femur is usually axially loaded. If the hip is abducted at the time of injury, a femoral neck fracture occurs; if adducted, the result is often a fracture-dislocation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and examination findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elderly patients usually describe the sudden onset of hip pain, either before or following a fall, and the inability to walk, although some patients with a minimally impacted fracture may continue to bear weight. A displaced hip fracture usually involves a significant amount of groin pain and the leg may appear externally rotated and shortened. Typically there is little bruising because the fracture is intracapsular. With insufficiency fractures, there may be no obvious history of trauma and the patient may complain of vague knee, buttock, groin, or thigh pain.</p><p>Particularly with elderly patients, the clinician should determine the reason for any fall (eg, syncope, stroke), assess for additional orthopedic and internal injuries, and initiate management as indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs of the hip, including an anterior-posterior (AP) view with maximal internal rotation and a lateral view, should be obtained in all patients with a suspected hip fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89081\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89081 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89080\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89080 \">image 2</a>). Comparison with the uninvolved hip can be helpful and therefore an AP pelvis radiograph is frequently obtained.</p><p>Radiographs should be examined for alterations in the normal trabecular pattern, defects in the cortex, and shortening or angulation of the femoral neck. The normal angle between the femoral neck and the femoral shaft on an AP radiograph is 45 degrees. The angle between the medial femoral shaft and the trabecular lines running through the shaft to the femoral head is 160 to 170 degrees. Alterations in these angles suggest a fracture.</p><p>The Garden classification scheme is based upon radiographic appearance and is used specifically for femoral neck fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 is an impaction fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60318\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60318 \">image 3</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 is a nondisplaced fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74524\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74524 \">image 4</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 3 involves varus displacement of the femoral head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F90773\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90773 \">image 5</a>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 4 involves complete loss of continuity between fragments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59095\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59095 \">image 6</a>)</p><p/><p>If plain radiographs are unrevealing but pain is significant and clinical suspicion is high or the patient is at high risk, a bone scan or MRI can determine the presence of a fracture. MRI has the advantages of earlier fracture detection and the absence of radiation exposure. It can take up to 72 hours following an injury before diagnostic findings appear on a bone scan.</p><p>Several studies highlight the importance of obtaining additional imaging when indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. In one retrospective study of 764 patients with hip pain evaluated in the emergency department for a possible fracture, 24 fractures were identified using MRI among the 545 patients whose initial radiographs were negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In another observational study, a femoral neck or intertrochanteric fracture was identified by MRI in 46 of 100 consecutive patients being evaluated for hip fracture whose initial plain radiographs were unrevealing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for orthopedic consultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Femoral neck fractures should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon, as most will require surgical fixation.

Co-management with an orthopedic surgeon may be appropriate in such circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of femoral neck fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary care clinician often plays an important role in assessing the patient's preinjury level of function and comorbidities to help determine appropriate goals for treatment. Ambulatory patients should be treated aggressively, typically with surgical intervention, with the goal of restoring their preinjury level of activity as quickly as possible.</p><p>Debate continues among surgeons as to whether open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) or arthroplasty is the best treatment for appropriate surgical candidates. In a systematic review of this subject that included 19 trials (3044 participants), internal fixation was found to result in lower morbidity in several categories, including blood loss and risk of deep wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, patients treated with arthroplasty had significantly lower reoperation rates. No differences were identified in mortality or regaining previous residential status. Treatment with a total or partial hip arthroplasty allows for earlier recovery and may reduce the risk of avascular necrosis and nonunion. A subsequent retrospective analysis of a database of 9640 patients undergoing operative repair of a hip fracture reported that ORIF of femoral neck fractures was associated with the highest percentage of total adverse events and major adverse events (primarily death), whereas hemiarthroplasty was associated with a higher percentage of minor adverse events (eg, urinary tract infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>Nonoperative management is generally reserved for debilitated patients but may be reasonable in patients with stable, impacted fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. One randomized trial of 23 patients reported that 10 of 16 patients treated conservatively developed a nonunion while none of those treated surgically did so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, a prospective study of nonoperative treatment for patients with impacted femoral neck fractures (n = 170) found that 86 percent healed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The authors concluded that such management is reasonable, but should be restricted to patients over 70 years and in poor health. Mortality in the study population was 16 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection and thromboembolism are potentially life-threatening complications associated with hip fractures for which prophylaxis should be given. The prevention and management of these complications is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical consultation for patients with hip fracture&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Femoral neck fractures have a relatively high rate of complications compared with extracapsular hip fractures. Potential complications following surgical repair include infection, chronic pain, dislocation, nonunion, avascular necrosis (AVN), and posttraumatic arthritic changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reported nonunion rates range from 0 to 4 percent to over 30 percent. Selection bias may play a role in this wide range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A number of factors determine the risk of nonunion, including patient age, bone density, fracture displacement, fracture comminution, reduction quality, and the prosthetic device and its position. Nonunion or loss of reduction can present with groin, hip, or thigh pain that never fully resolves following surgery, or increases after a period of improvement.</p><p>Radiographs should be obtained periodically for a minimum of three years following surgery to screen for the development of AVN. Patients with displaced fractures are at greatest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. AVN may be painless initially but causes pain and limits motion over time. Typically, the pain is localized to the groin or ipsilateral buttock region, but may manifest as referred knee pain, and increases with weightbearing. Radiographic assessment using a MRI or bone scan is necessary when AVN is suspected. Changes on plain radiographs do not reliably appear until six months after AVN first develops. MRI is used to assess patients with titanium hardware; a bone scan is used in those whose fracture fixation hardware is ferromagnetic.

In the younger population, there is a high incidence of associated internal and orthopedic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and examination findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elderly patients usually describe hip pain, swelling, and ecchymosis. The injured leg may be shortened and externally rotated if the fracture is displaced. As opposed to femoral neck fractures, intertrochanteric fractures are extracapsular and significant ecchymosis may be present, depending upon the time elapsed since the injury. A large amount of blood can be lost into the thigh and hemodynamic status should be closely monitored.</p><p>The patient will have local tenderness over the trochanteric area, but should not have tenderness over the distal femoral shaft or pelvis.

In stable fractures, the lesser trochanter is not displaced, there is no comminution, and the medial cortices of the proximal and distal fragments are in alignment.

Infection and thromboembolism are potentially life-threatening complications for which prophylaxis should be given. The prevention and management of these complications is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical consultation for patients with hip fracture&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nonunion is reported in only 1 to 2 percent of intertrochanteric fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This is likely because the fracture occurs primarily in cancellous bone. Nonunion is typically diagnosed by a persistent radiolucent defect at the fracture site four to seven months after fracture fixation. However, in patients with abundant callous formation, loss of alignment may be the sole radiographic finding.</p><p>The rates of avascular necrosis (AVN) and nonunion are lower with intertrochanteric fractures than with femoral neck fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. However, overall mortality and functional outcome is generally worse with intertrochanteric fractures. One case series reported a 15 percent mortality rate after intertrochanteric hip fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hip-fractures-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. This relatively high rate was attributed to the number of major perioperative medical problems and postoperative complications.</p><p>Fixation failure occurs in up to 20 percent with some fracture patterns, typically within four months of fixation. AVN occurs at higher rates in patients with more complex or displaced fractures and in women. The typical appearance is varus collapse of the proximal fragment and cutout of the compression screw.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">TROCHANTERIC FRACTURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated trochanteric fractures usually result from forceful muscular contraction of a fixed limb and occur most often in young, active adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Pertinent anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The greater trochanter is a bony prominence on the lateral aspect of the proximal femur.

The general categories include intracapsular (femoral neck and head) and extracapsular (intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric) fractures. Fracture classification is described further in the text.
