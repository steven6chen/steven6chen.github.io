The most common presentation of PG is the rapid development of one or more painful, purulent ulcer with undermined borders on sites of normal or traumatized skin. </p><p>Although multiple local and systemic therapies have been utilized for PG, high quality efficacy studies are lacking for most interventions. Topical and systemic corticosteroids, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, and systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> are among the most commonly utilized pharmacologic agents. </p><p>The management and prognosis of PG will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of PG are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyoderma gangrenosum: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1178500\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The careful exclusion of other disorders that may cause cutaneous ulceration is an important first step in the management of lesions that appear consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). This is of particular importance since certain therapies utilized for PG can be ineffective or harmful in other diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H24503942\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyoderma gangrenosum: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H4374004\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyoderma gangrenosum: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>As a result of the paucity of data on interventions for PG, definitive guidelines for patient management are lacking. The approach to the treatment of PG is primarily guided by small uncontrolled studies and clinical experience. In general, patients are managed with a combination of topical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic therapies that suppress the inflammatory process and wound care measures that optimize the environment for wound healing. Although initial signs of improvement may be evident within days of the start of treatment, weeks to months are often required to achieve complete ulcer healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>For patients with mild PG (few superficial ulcers or vegetative PG), the local administration of corticosteroids or a calcineurin inhibitor can be sufficient for treatment. In contrast, systemic therapy is typically necessary in patients with more extensive PG. Glucocorticoids are the most common systemic drugs prescribed since a rapid response is often observed, and the drugs are relatively low in cost and are easily administered. Systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is an alternative first-line treatment for patients who cannot tolerate systemic glucocorticoid therapy. </p><p>A wide variety of other systemic immunomodulatory drugs can be utilized as alternative or adjunctive treatments for PG that fails to respond sufficiently to first-line therapies. Examples include biologic drugs, conventional immunosuppressants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Infliximab</a> has demonstrated efficacy for PG in a randomized trial, and its concomitant utility in Crohn's disease favors the use of this drug in patients with both diseases. In patients with mild PG that is resistant to local therapy, we often prescribe a trial of dapsone or minocycline, which are generally well tolerated, prior to treatment with immunosuppressive therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) and alkylating agents are treatment options that are typically reserved for patients with severe, refractory disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>PG frequently occurs in association with other medical disorders, most commonly inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic malignancy, and arthritis. Although the course of the disease does not always parallel PG, treatment of the associated disorder sometimes results in improvement in PG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H4373281\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyoderma gangrenosum: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Associated disorders'</a> and <a href=\"#H1178633\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The treatment options for PG are reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H603390\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the severity of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) influences the choice of initial therapy. Although local interventions successfully induce healing in some patients with mild disease, patients with more extensive PG require systemic therapy to arrest disease activity. Documentation of the size, number, and location of ulcers and serial clinical photographs are useful for following the response to therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1178507\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of wound care in PG is to create an optimal environment for wound healing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1796381\"><span class=\"h3\">Local care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wounds should be cleansed gently with tepid sterile saline or a mild antiseptic prior to dressing changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Wound dressings that promote a moist wound environment and do not adhere to the wound base are preferred, as they may be beneficial for healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management#H456664428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;, section on 'Importance of moisture'</a>.)</p><p>The selection of a specific type of wound dressing depends on the nature of the wound and patient and clinician preferences. As an example, patients with wounds that are highly exudative may benefit from the use of more absorptive wound dressings, such as alginates to avoid tissue maceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management#H55268776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;, section on 'Wound dressings'</a>.)</p><p><strong>Pathergy</strong> (exacerbation of lesions at sites of trauma) can occur in PG. Thus, unnecessary traumatic insults to the wound, such as the use of wet to dry dressings and the application of caustic substances (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a>) should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyoderma-gangrenosum-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H24503928\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyoderma gangrenosum: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the area of ulceration or erosion, attention should also be paid to the surrounding skin. Use of a barrier cream or ointment, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a> paste or petrolatum, may help to prevent skin breakdown at the wound edge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Patients should be monitored for clinical signs of wound infection (eg, fever, warmth, swelling, malodor, lymphangitic streaks, increased drainage, or pain), and should be treated appropriately with antibiotics if infection occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Hyperbaric oxygen has been reported to be of benefit for wound healing in a few patients with PG, but data are insufficient to recommend the routine use of this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1796199\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the potential for pathergy, the role of surgery for wound management in PG is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Surgical procedures are considered only in select cases, such as those in which accumulation of necrotic tissue presents a risk for infection or where vital tissues such as tendons or ligaments are exposed in the ulcer bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Although multiple cases in which PG worsened following surgical intervention have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>], documentation of cases in which gentle debridement, skin flaps or grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>], split thickness grafts with negative pressure wound therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and the application of bioengineered keratinocyte autografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] or allogenic cultured dermal substitutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] appeared to be beneficial in PG exists. To minimize the likelihood of pathergy, performance of surgical procedures should be limited to periods of good disease control, and patients should be concomitantly treated with systemic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Although stoma closure can lead to resolution of peristomal PG, recurrence of PG may be common after relocation or revision of a stoma. In a retrospective chart review of 44 patients with peristomal PG, 10 of 15 patients (67 percent) who underwent relocation or revision of a stoma developed recurrent PG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1178521\"><span class=\"h2\">Limited disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local interventions can be used as initial therapy in patients with mild, localized PG (eg, few superficial ulcers or vegetative PG). When effective, local treatment is preferred due to the relatively low risk of serious adverse effects. The most common interventions utilized are topically or intralesionally administered corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors. Local therapy should be delivered to the ulcer's inflamed periphery.</p><p>No randomized trials of topical or intralesional therapies for PG have been performed, and additional studies are necessary to determine the best approach to local management. We typically utilize a superpotent topical corticosteroid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> 0.05% ointment) as initial therapy. Improvement is usually evident within two to three weeks. In patients who fail to demonstrate improvement with a superpotent topical corticosteroid within this time period, we attempt treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> 0.1% ointment or systemic therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1178528\"><span class=\"h3\">Local corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although topical corticosteroids are frequently prescribed as primary and adjunctive therapies in PG, data on the efficacy of these agents are limited to a few retrospective studies and case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20</a>]. High potency or superpotent topical corticosteroids, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate, are usually applied once or twice daily (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>). A multicenter prospective cohort study that evaluated outcomes of topical therapy in 66 patients with PG supports benefit of topical corticosteroid treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Most patients (74 percent) received clobetasol propionate 0.05%; the remaining patients received topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> 0.03 or 0.1% ointment. At six months, 28 of the 64 patients (44 percent) for whom information on healing was available had healed on topical therapy alone, including 20 of 47 (43 percent) treated with clobetasol and 5 of 10 (50 percent) treated with topical tacrolimus. The median time to healing was 145 days. Initial ulcer size was a significant predictor of time to healing. In a separate open-label study in which 5 of 13 patients treated with clobetasol 0.05% ointment or lotion achieved complete healing, the average time to healing was 6.5 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Although some clinicians, including ourselves, avoid intralesional injections due to concern for the induction of pathergy, case reports have documented efficacy of intralesional corticosteroid therapy in PG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23-26</a>]. Concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> between 6 and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> have been utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The corticosteroid is injected circumferentially into the ulcer periphery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intralesional-injection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intralesional injection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cutaneous atrophy is one of the most common adverse effects of topical and intralesional corticosteroid therapy. Adverse effects are reviewed in greater detail separately.

In one uncontrolled study, a compounded formulation of 0.3% tacrolimus in a carmellose sodium paste appeared to be effective for peristomal PG; 7 of 11 patients treated with the tacrolimus formulation and 5 of 13 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> 0.05% lotion or ointment achieved complete healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> is commercially available as a 0.03% and 0.1% ointment. We typically instruct the patient to apply the 0.1% ointment once to twice daily. Improvement may be evident within the first few days to weeks of treatment. However, complete healing of an ulcer may take several weeks to a few months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Treatment is usually well tolerated; occasionally, patients experience mild burning sensations at the site of application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Other calcineurin inhibitors may have benefit for PG, but fewer data are available on these agents. A case report documented improvement with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimecrolimus</a> 1% cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Improvement with topical or intralesional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> has been described in a few patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1178542\"><span class=\"h2\">More extensive disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with PG cannot be managed with local therapy alone. Systemic treatment is used as a first-line intervention in PG that is not limited to a few superficial ulcers or a solitary plaque of vegetative PG. Systemic agents are also appropriate for patients with mild PG that fails to improve with local therapy.</p><p>The systemic therapies utilized in PG are immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents that calm the inflammatory process to allow for wound healing. Systemic glucocorticoids often induce a rapid response and are typically used as initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In patients who cannot tolerate or fail to respond to systemic glucocorticoids, treatment with systemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> can be attempted. Of note, topical or intralesional corticosteroids and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> are often used as adjuncts to systemic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1178528\" class=\"local\">'Local corticosteroids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1178535\" class=\"local\">'Local calcineurin inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1180235\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple case reports, case series, and our clinical experience support the use of systemic glucocorticoids for the treatment of PG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,37</a>]. The response of PG to systemic glucocorticoid varies, as demonstrated in a single-blind randomized trial (n = 112) that found a similar pace of improvement among patients assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> (initial dose 0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) and patients assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> (initial dose 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) over the first six weeks of treatment, but only a 47 percent rate of complete healing in both groups after six months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Placebo-controlled randomized trials assessing efficacy of systemic glucocorticoids are lacking.</p><p>We typically initiate treatment with 0.5 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or its equivalent, with a maximum dose of 60 mg of prednisone per day. In very aggressive or painful disease, intravenous pulse corticosteroids (1 g <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> per day for one to five days) can be used as initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>The response to systemic glucocorticoids is usually rapid; stabilization of the disease is often evident within the first week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Pain also tends to improve soon after the initiation of treatment. However, since complete ulcer healing may take weeks to months, and long-term therapy with systemic glucocorticoids is associated with significant adverse effects, glucocorticoids are tapered as soon as is feasible. We typically begin to taper glucocorticoids once disease progression has stopped and clear signs of improvement are noted (reductions in pain, visible inflammation, and wound size).</p><p>We aim to taper and discontinue glucocorticoids within 4 to 10 weeks and monitor patients closely for continued improvement. We usually add a glucocorticoid-sparing agent (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>) to maintain improvement during and after tapering.

Overall, 68 percent of patients achieved complete remission within six months, and 95 percent were in remission within three years.</p><p/><p>The effect of treatment of associated underlying medical disorders on disease activity in patients with PG is variable, as the course of PG does not always parallel that of the related underlying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyoderma-gangrenosum-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Pyoderma gangrenosum (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2054609\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an uncommon inflammatory and ulcerative disorder that may occur independently or in association with a variety of systemic diseases. (See <a href=\"#H1178493\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on treatments for PG are limited and definitive guidelines for patient management are lacking. Treatment typically involves the use of one or more topical or systemic immunomodulatory agents. (See <a href=\"#H1178500\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound care measures in PG are intended to optimize the environment for wound healing. Wound dressings that maintain a moist wound environment are preferred. Due to the potential for pathergy (exacerbation of PG at sites of tissue injury), unnecessary trauma should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H1178507\" class=\"local\">'Wound management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of surgery is controversial in PG due to the possibility of the induction of pathergy. Surgical procedures should be avoided in most cases. Surgery may be necessary in select cases, such as those in which tissue necrosis presents a risk for infection or in which exposure of vital tissues such as tendons or ligaments is present. (See <a href=\"#H1796199\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of PG influences the approach to treatment. For patients with mild, localized PG (few superficial ulcers or a plaque of vegetative PG), we suggest initial treatment with a high potency or superpotent topical corticosteroid or topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients with mild PG who fail to improve with local interventions should be treated with systemic therapy. We often attempt treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> prior to the initiation of more aggressive immunomodulatory therapies. (See <a href=\"#H1178521\" class=\"local\">'Limited disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with more extensive PG, systemic treatment is indicated. We suggest initiating treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> with or without systemic glucocorticoids may be used as an alternative first-line therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1178542\" class=\"local\">'More extensive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A wide variety of other systemic immunomodulatory agents appear to have efficacy in PG. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Infliximab</a> was effective for PG in a randomized trial, and may be particularly useful in patients who require treatment of both PG and Crohn's disease. The cost of infliximab and the requirement for infusion are potential limiting factors for the use of infliximab therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1178549\" class=\"local\">'Second-line and adjunctive therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is estimated that with treatment, more than half of patients with PG achieve wound healing within one year, and almost all patients achieve remission with longer follow-up. However, relapses can occur after long periods of disease remission. (See <a href=\"#H1178633\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyoderma-gangrenosum-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bennett ML, Jackson JM, Jorizzo JL, et al.
