The definitive diagnosis of renal allograft dysfunction still requires an invasive allograft biopsy, which remains the gold standard for the assessment of graft status. Given their low sensitivity, existing markers fail to detect subclinical changes, and pathologic processes are often recognized at a relatively advanced stage. &quot;Protocol&quot; or screening biopsies have been proposed in kidney transplant recipients to identify early pathologic changes that may be evident before graft dysfunction. However, a number of limitations reduce the utility of screening biopsies in clinical practice: Biopsies are invasive, and complications may occur; sampling errors may jeopardize their diagnostic utility; and the procedures are costly and labor intensive.

Although several such markers have been found to provide good diagnostic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prognostic utility, few, if any, are used in clinical practice, and there is insufficient evidence that their use will lead to meaningful improvements in graft outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review investigational methods in the diagnosis of acute rejection of the renal allograft. The clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of renal allograft rejection, and the evaluation and diagnosis of renal allograft dysfunction, are discussed separately.

Assessment of the predictive performance of a biomarker (ie, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values) requires knowledge of the actual diagnosis. Because allograft biopsies are considered the gold standard, it is impossible to determine their sensitivity and specificity, despite known limitations of biopsy data. Specifically, the problem of sampling error likely results in biopsies that do not include tissue that is adversely affected by pathologic processes, thereby increasing the proportion of false-negative tests (ie, the absence of a histologic lesion is not proof of the absence of this lesion). However, no other diagnostic method can provide information about the true state of the allograft, and, therefore, the actual diagnostic performance of the allograft biopsy remains unknown. In addition, pathologists frequently vary in their interpretation of biopsy findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-care-of-the-adult-kidney-transplant-recipient#H2431306029\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of care of the adult kidney transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Renal biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2803572088\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum creatinine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum creatinine concentration is one of the primary markers used to monitor renal allograft function in clinical practice. Early graft function, as determined by measurement of serum creatinine at one year posttransplant, has been shown to predict long-term graft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, at an individual level, a serum creatinine value is neither sensitive nor specific for graft injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Subclinical rejection develops in the absence of overt graft dysfunction. In addition, an increase in serum creatinine after transplantation may reflect a variety of underlying processes including acute tubular injury, immunosuppressive drug toxicity, obstructive nephropathy, and infection-associated nephropathy.

Several observational studies have shown that increased urine protein excretion posttransplant is an important and independent predictor of graft failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. However, albuminuria and proteinuria are nonspecific markers of graft injury, and an association between proteinuria and specific pathologic processes in the renal allograft has not been well described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/8,9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,14</a>]. One study of 1518 renal transplant recipients evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic performance of measuring proteinuria after transplantation, at the time of graft dysfunction (with clinically indicated biopsies), and during routine clinical follow-up (with protocol biopsies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. After three months posttransplant, proteinuria &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/24</span> hours at the time of a clinically indicated biopsy had a high specificity (85 to 91 percent) but low sensitivity (21 to 48 percent) for the combination of transplant glomerulopathy, microcirculation inflammation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> de <span class=\"nowrap\">novo/recurrent</span> glomerular disease. Thus, biomarkers that are more sensitive for detecting potentially treatable graft injuries are needed.

Low levels of DSAs, which are not a contraindication to transplant, may subsequently lead to a wide spectrum of antibody-mediated graft injuries and, therefore, require individual risk assessment. While advances in screening methods have increased the sensitivity for detecting very low levels of DSAs, the specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of DSA for the risk of developing antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) have decreased. As an example, in one study of 402 deceased-donor renal transplant recipients, the sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of a remote positive complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch for detecting subsequent ABMR were 41, 97, and 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. By comparison, with the single-antigen (Luminex) bead assay, the sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of a preformed DSA on the peak serum were 91, 85, and 35 percent.

However, despite the widespread use of posttransplant monitoring for DSAs, the utility of this strategy to noninvasively diagnose ABMR or predict long-term graft outcomes has not been clearly evaluated. In one study of 281 indication biopsies (ie, biopsies performed in the setting of allograft dysfunction) in 244 renal transplant recipients, the presence of DSA (both preexisting and de novo) at the time of allograft biopsy was associated with the diagnosis of ABMR (odds ratio [OR] 3.6 and 10.4 for mean fluorescence intensity [MFI] of 1000 to 3000 and &gt;3000, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, many patients with DSAs did not have ABMR, suggesting that DSA should be considered as a risk factor for rather than diagnostic of ABMR. Another study reported an association between de novo DSAs and the histologic findings of peritubular capillaritis and C4d deposition on allograft biopsy, but the percentage of biopsies meeting the criteria for ABMR was not provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2061370073\"><span class=\"h1\">NONINVASIVE BIOMARKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The limitations of existing markers of renal allograft dysfunction highlight the need for innovative, robust, and, ideally, noninvasive methods to predict and diagnose acute and chronic graft injury. The development of &quot;omics&quot; methods (eg, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) in the field of transplantation has paved the way for the development of several candidate biomarkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>].

The interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT), which measures IFN-gamma secretion by recipient T cells in response to donor antigens, is one test that has been used to assess antidonor T cell alloreactivity in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Several studies have found that pretransplant T cell alloreactivity, as determined by the IFN-gamma ELISPOT, may be associated with an increased risk of posttransplant acute rejection and lower posttransplant graft function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-29</a>]. However, in one multicenter observational study of 176 renal transplant recipients, a correlation between pretransplant ELISPOT reactivity and acute rejection or posttransplant graft function was only observed in patients who did not receive induction therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a> (rATG)-Thymoglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. One study found that the persistence of donor-specific T cell alloreactivity at 6 months after transplantation, under conditions of potent immunosuppression, was associated with subclinical T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) and worse allograft function at 12 months posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Although assays such as the IFN-gamma ELISPOT may be helpful in monitoring T cell alloreactivity, wider application may be limited by their laborious, time-consuming, and impractical use in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3353510235\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular blood biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have identified potential biomarkers in peripheral blood that may identify patients with acute renal allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/32-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-41</a>]. The following discussion will focus on important advances in the field of peripheral blood messenger RNA (mRNA) and donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) analysis and the diagnosis and prediction of acute rejection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3469527830\"><span class=\"h3\">Kidney Solid Organ Response Test (kSORT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Kidney Solid Organ Response Test (kSORT) is a microarray-based assay that was developed to detect patients at high risk for acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The test, performed on a peripheral blood sample, employs quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to measure the relative mRNA expression levels of 17 genes known to be associated with acute rejection or leukocyte trafficking. A correlation-based algorithm is then used to generate risk scores and classify patients into high, low, or indeterminate risk of acute rejection. The utility of the kSORT assay was evaluated in a large multicenter study of 436 adult and pediatric renal transplant recipients (Assessment of Acute Rejection in Renal Transplantation [AART]) with paired peripheral blood samples and renal allograft biopsies (performed for allograft dysfunction or as part of a clinical protocol) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The kSORT assay was able to predict patients at high risk of acute rejection (either TCMR or antibody-mediated rejection [ABMR]) with a sensitivity and specificity of 92 and 93 percent, respectively. In addition, kSORT was able to identify 12 of 16 biopsies with subclinical rejection and could predict clinical rejection in more than 60 percent of samples collected within three months before the diagnosis of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection. However, the test was unable to distinguish between acute TCMR and ABMR.</p><p>A subsequent study evaluated the use of kSORT and the IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays (see <a href=\"#H2080638379\" class=\"local\">'Functional cell-based immune monitoring'</a> above) in predicting subclinical acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Among 75 renal transplant recipients who received six-month protocol biopsies, 22 (29 percent) had evidence of subclinical acute rejection (17 with subclinical TCMR, 4 with subclinical ABMR, 1 with subclinical mixed rejection). The kSORT assay independently predicted subclinical acute rejection with high accuracy (specificity and positive predictive value [PPV] of 98 and 93 percent, respectively), while the ELISPOT test was able to rule out subclinical TCMR with high precision (specificity and negative predictive value [NPV] of 70 and 93 percent, respectively). Combined use of both the kSORT and ELISPOT assays improved the predictive probability for subclinical acute rejection and the ability to distinguish between subclinical TCMR and ABMR.</p><p>Larger studies in unselected patient populations are needed to further assess the clinical utility of the kSORT assay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3939242827\"><span class=\"h3\">Donor-derived cell-free DNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During allograft rejection, large amounts of dd-cfDNA are released from the injured allograft into the bloodstream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

A three-gene signature of CD3-epsilon mRNA, IFN-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) mRNA, and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was able to distinguish between renal biopsy specimens showing acute TCMR and those without rejection with a sensitivity of 71 to 79 percent and specificity of 72 to 78 percent. In addition, the molecular signature could distinguish acute TCMR from borderline rejection, acute ABMR, or chronic allograft nephropathy with a sensitivity and specificity of 79 and 71 percent, respectively. Evaluation of the three-gene signature in repeated urine samples over time suggested that this test could also predict the development of acute TCMR weeks before the onset of graft dysfunction.</p><p>While these results appear promising, the potential for extensive degradation of mRNAs in urine is one important limitation of this assay.

The following studies illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an initial study that profiled urinary miRNAs of stable transplant patients and those with acute TCMR, miR-10a, miR-10b, and miR-210 were strongly deregulated in the urine of patients with acute TCMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Fifty-six miRNAs were identified as differentially expressed in biopsy samples with <span class=\"nowrap\">IF/TA;</span> five of these (miR-142-3p, miR-204, miR-107, miR-211, and miR-32) were confirmed using an independent set of samples. Differential expression of miR-142-3p, miR-204, and miR-211 in the urine of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IF/TA</span> was also observed. Findings of a second study suggested that the combination of miRNA profiling of biopsy and urine samples could be used to monitor graft function and predict progression to chronic allograft dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p>These preliminary findings will need to be validated in independent and unselected populations to assess the diagnostic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prognostic accuracy as well as the clinical utility of urine miRNAs. In addition, as the aforementioned studies quantified miRNAs in whole urine, urine cell pellets, or cell-free urine supernatant, the ideal medium to be used for urine miRNA profiling is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1596512771\"><span class=\"h3\">Urine proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of urinary immune-related proteins have been identified as biomarkers of acute rejection of the renal allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. As examples, elevated urinary levels of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands 9 and 10 (CXCL9 and CXCL10) have been associated with acute TCMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/64-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-71</a>]. In a multicenter observational study of 280 adult and pediatric renal transplant recipients (Clinical Trial in Organ Transplant [CTOT1]) that evaluated multiple urinary proteins and mRNAs as biomarkers of acute rejection, elevated urinary CXCL9 levels had a PPV and NPV of 68 and 92 percent, respectively, for diagnosing Banff &ge;1A TCMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Urinary levels of CXCL10 are also elevated in patients with ABMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a study of 244 renal transplant patients, elevated urinary CXCL10 levels had a PPV and NPV of 55 and 86 percent for the diagnosis of ABMR. However, increased urinary CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels have also been detected in patients with BK virus (BKV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], suggesting that these chemokines may represent markers of allograft inflammation rather than specific diagnostic markers of acute rejection.</p><p>Some studies have suggested that measuring urinary chemokines may have prognostic value in renal transplant recipients. One study, for example, found that urinary concentration of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2, also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MPC1]) at six months posttransplant was a predictor of severe <span class=\"nowrap\">IF/TA</span> and graft dysfunction at two years posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. In the CTOT1 study cited above, patients with stable allografts and low urinary CXCL9 levels at 6 months posttransplant were least likely to subsequently develop TCMR or a reduction in estimated GFR (eGFR) between 6 and 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Similarly, in another study, low urinary CXCL10 levels at one and three months posttransplant were associated with improved rejection-free allograft survival at one year posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Urinary CXCL10 at three months independently predicted the subsequent development of clinical acute rejection with a PPV and NPV of 13 and 97 percent, respectively. Although the PPV was low, the high NPV suggested that urinary CXCL10 levels could serve to identify patients at low risk of rejection who might be optimal candidates for immunosuppressive drug weaning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267431526\"><span class=\"h3\">Urine proteomics/peptidomics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-throughput methods have been used to identify proteomic and peptidomic signatures of acute rejection in urine and blood samples. Several studies have suggested that proteomic or peptidomic signatures can be used to noninvasively diagnose acute rejection with high sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Proteins and peptides differentially expressed in patients with acute rejection have been identified, including fragments of collagens, beta-2-microglobulin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, and uromodulin. In addition, the high-throughput approach has enabled pathway-enrichment analysis that has uncovered key pathogenic processes, such as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen presentation; IFN-gamma and integrin signaling; complement activation; platelet function; and keratin sulfate, glycosaminoglycan, and collagen metabolism.</p><p>While these findings support the applicability of proteomic approaches in the diagnosis of acute rejection, additional points need to be addressed. As an example, fewer studies have performed proteomic profiling of other histopathologic entities such as subclinical rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>], ABMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/79-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-83</a>], mixed rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>], and chronic rejection phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/80,81,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81,85</a>], which have only more recently been specifically defined in the Banff classification system. In addition, the lack of large-scale studies prevents the assessment of confounding factors, such as urinary tract infection, cytomegalovirus infection, or BKV nephropathy, or of superimposed histologic lesions such as acute tubular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>] that may associate with distinct proteomic signatures. Thus, longitudinal evaluation of these new assays should be performed in unselected, consecutively recruited patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Another aspect that has not been addressed is the potential use of proteomic approaches as prognostic biomarkers (ie, to anticipate rejection or graft outcome) or as predictive biomarkers (ie, to assess response to antirejection treatment). Finally, implementing proteomic markers into widespread clinical application will require standardization of the preanalytical procedures for sample preparation and development of simplified test systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3507312152\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the biomarkers discussed above, medical imaging methods have also been developed as noninvasive approaches to diagnosing graft dysfunction and assessing graft status.

The following studies illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, microarray results from 403 renal transplant biopsies (35 with a diagnosis of TCMR) were used to derive a classifier that assigned TCMR scores to all biopsies; scores were then compared with the histologic diagnosis of the biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Transcripts that distinguished biopsies with TCMR from other transplant biopsies were primarily associated with effector T cell and macrophage infiltration and activation. Molecular scores correlated with histologic lesions of TCMR (tubulitis and interstitial infiltration) with an accuracy of 89 percent. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of a high TCMR molecular score (&ge;0.1) for predicting the histologic diagnosis of TCMR were 62 and 92 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a parallel study from the same group, microarray results from the same 403 renal transplant biopsies (56 with a <span class=\"nowrap\">histologic/donor-specific</span> antibody [DSA] diagnosis of ABMR) were used to derive a classifier that assigned ABMR scores to all biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Most of the transcripts that distinguished biopsies with ABMR from other transplant biopsies were expressed in natural killer (NK) cells or endothelial cells or were interferon (IFN)-gamma inducible. A positive ABMR molecular score (&ge;0.2) had a PPV and NPV of 64 and 91 percent, respectively, for predicting the <span class=\"nowrap\">histologic/DSA</span> diagnosis of ABMR. In addition, ABMR molecular scores were strongly associated with DSA positivity and were an independent predictor of graft failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The performance of the TCMR and ABMR molecular scoring systems was prospectively evaluated in a multicenter study (Integrated Diagnostic System in the International Collaborative Microarray [INTERCOM]) of 300 renal transplant biopsies from 264 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. Histologic diagnoses of TCMR or ABMR (including C4d-positive ABMR, C4d-negative ABMR, and mixed ABMR and TCMR rejection) were present in 11 and 15 percent of biopsies, respectively. A TCMR molecular score of &ge;0.1 predicted the histologic diagnosis of TCMR (including borderline rejection) with a PPV and NPV of 49 and 94 percent, respectively. Similarly, an ABMR molecular score of &ge;0.2 predicted the diagnosis of ABMR or mixed rejection with PPV and NPV of 50 and 94 percent, respectively. There was no significant difference in the ABMR score between biopsies with C4d-positive ABMR and those with C4d-negative ABMR. A positive ABMR score in late biopsies (performed more than one year posttransplant) was significantly associated with death-censored graft loss at three years (hazard ratio [HR] 2.93, 95% CI 1.97-4.36); no association between the TCMR score and death-censored graft loss was observed.</p><p/><p>Collectively, the results of these studies demonstrate that molecular phenotyping of renal transplant biopsies is capable of discriminating between rejection and nonrejection at least as well as, if not better than, histologic evaluation and DSA alone. Discrepancies between molecular and histologic diagnoses, as evidenced by the relatively low PPVs in the studies discussed above, reflect a combination of issues including histologic errors or ambiguity, MMDx errors, and sampling differences (ie, different biopsy cores assessed by histology and MMDx) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Microarray analysis of renal allograft biopsy tissue has also been used to predict the risk of fibrosis and allograft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-methods-in-the-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

The definitive diagnosis of renal allograft dysfunction still requires an invasive allograft biopsy, which remains the gold standard for the assessment of graft status. Given their low sensitivity, existing markers fail to detect subclinical changes, and pathologic processes are often recognized at a relatively advanced stage. (See <a href=\"#H1302659884\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of currently used biomarkers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Innovative strategies have been developed to circumvent the limitations of existing biomarkers. Several noninvasive monitoring tools have been proposed that use easily accessible biologic fluids such as urine and blood, allowing frequent and sequential assessments of a recipient's immune status. These include functional cell-based assays and the evaluation of molecular expression, at the messenger RNA (mRNA) or protein level, on a wide spectrum of platforms. Molecular technologies, including the molecular microscope diagnostic system (MMDx), have been developed over the past decade as a refinement of the histologic evaluation of the allograft biopsy. The translation and validation of exploratory findings and their implementation into standard clinical practice remain challenging. Dedicated, prospective, interventional trials are required to demonstrate that the use of these biomarkers improves patient or transplant outcomes.
