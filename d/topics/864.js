The condition is characterized by the progressive loss of terminal hairs on the scalp in a characteristic distribution. The anterior scalp, mid scalp, temporal scalp, and vertex of the scalp are typical sites of involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83802%7EDERM%2F83804%7EDERM%2F63010%7EDERM%2F83805\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83802 graphicRef83804 graphicRef63010 graphicRef83805 \">picture 1A-D</a>). &quot;Male balding&quot; and &quot;male pattern hair loss&quot; are additional terms used to refer to this condition.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of androgenetic alopecia in men will be reviewed here. Other causes of nonscarring alopecia and the treatment of androgenetic alopecia are discussed separately.

In humans, all terminal hair follicles are present at birth, and follicular growth occurs in cyclical manner. The growth cycle for follicles on the scalp consists of three main phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The growth phase, termed <strong>anagen</strong>, lasts two to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The duration of this phase determines the hair length.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The involutional phase, termed <strong>catagen</strong>, lasts two to three weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The resting phase, termed <strong>telogen</strong>, lasts two to three months. Hair is released from the hair shaft and shed at the end of telogen, and the next hair cycle is initiated. Telogen hairs are characterized by a mature root sheath, or &quot;club,&quot; at the proximal end (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50528 \">figure 1</a>). The term <strong>exogen</strong> has been used to describe the phase of active shedding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>In the normal scalp, approximately 80 to 90 percent of follicles are growing (anagen), about 5 to 10 percent are resting (telogen), and 1 to 3 percent are undergoing involution (catagen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Each day, up to 100 hairs are shed from the scalp and about the same number of follicles enter anagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21714527\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of male androgenetic alopecia varies by age and race. Approximately 30 percent of Caucasian men will develop androgenetic alopecia by age 30, 50 percent by age 50, and 80 percent by age 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Signs of androgenetic alopecia may first appear during adolescence. In one study, 16 percent of 15 to 17-year-old males had clinical evidence of androgenetic alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. About 15 percent of men never develop androgenetic alopecia apart from the normal post-pubertal temporal recession that develops in nearly all men. </p><p>Androgenetic alopecia is less common in Asian and African-American men than Caucasians and also starts later in life in these populations. Estimates suggest that African-American men are four times less likely to develop androgenetic alopecia than Caucasian men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>A family history of androgenetic alopecia is often present in balding men, but a negative history does not exclude the diagnosis. Men with a greater number of family members affected by male androgenetic alopecia are at an increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In particular, studies have found a high concordance of balding between fathers and sons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. For example, a study of 572 men evaluated in a dermatology clinic for concerns unrelated to androgenetic alopecia found that young men with a balding father were more than five times more likely to have androgenetic alopecia than young men with fathers without the condition (relative risk 5.5, 95% CI 1.26-23.99) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21714534\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the name suggests, the pathogenesis of male androgenetic alopecia involves both hormonal (androgens) and genetic factors. Balding is considered an androgen-dependent trait that requires a genetic predisposition. </p><p>The perception of hair &quot;loss&quot; in androgenetic alopecia results from a genetically determined and hormonally influenced shortening of the anagen phase, rather than the complete cessation of hair growth in affected areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This shift in the hair cycle results in a reduction of the anagen:telogen ratio of hair follicles from a normal ratio of 12:1 in a non-balding scalp to less than 5:1 in sites of androgenetic alopecia. The shortened anagen phase leads to the production of shorter, thinner hair shafts, a process often called <strong>follicular miniaturization </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83781\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83781 \">picture 2</a>). As additional follicles undergo miniaturization, hair coverage of the scalp progressively decreases. Eventually, the anagen phase may become so short that hair produced by a follicle fails to reach the skin surface. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21714541\"><span class=\"h2\">Androgens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of androgens in the pathogenesis of male androgenetic alopecia is well established. Androgenetic alopecia develops after puberty, a phase associated with a dramatic increase in androgen production. Moreover, early studies showed that males castrated before puberty did not develop androgenetic alopecia unless they were treated with testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The cellular effects of androgens are mediated through the androgen receptor. Consistent with an important role of androgens in androgenetic alopecia, patients with androgen insensitivity syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the androgen receptor, do not develop the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of disorders of androgen action&quot;, section on 'Complete androgen insensitivity (CAIS)'</a>.)</p><p>Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the key androgen involved in the induction and promotion of male androgenetic alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. DHT is a potent metabolite of testosterone, and compared to testosterone, DHT has a several-fold greater affinity for the androgen receptor. The conversion of testosterone to DHT is mediated by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. The 5-alpha-reductase enzyme exists in two isoforms in scalp hair follicles &ndash; type 1 and type 2. The type I isoform of 5-alpha-reductase is located in sebaceous glands, epidermal and follicular keratinocytes, dermal papillae cells, and sweat glands. The type 2 isoform is located in the outer root sheath of hair follicles as well as the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate. Although both isoforms have a role in androgenetic alopecia, the role of the type 2 isoform is greater. The importance of 5-alpha-reductase is evidenced by the absence of androgenetic alopecia in men with mutations in the 5-alpha-reductase type 2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] as well as the beneficial effects of inhibitors of 5-alpha-reductase (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dutasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dutasteride</a>) on androgenetic alopecia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Follicular miniaturization is caused by a hormonally-mediated process that occurs at the level of the hair follicle dermal papilla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. At the cellular level, DHT binds to the androgen receptor, and the hormone-receptor complex then activates the genes responsible for the gradual transformation of large, terminal follicles to smaller follicles with a shortened anagen phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. The transforming growth factor-beta gene may be one of the genes involved in this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Intrinsic differences in hormone metabolism and hormone receptors may contribute to the development of male androgenetic alopecia. Young men with androgenetic alopecia have higher levels of cellular 5-alpha-reductase and a higher quantity of androgen receptors in the balding scalp than in the non-balding scalp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, production rates of DHT are higher in men with androgenetic alopecia than in men without the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although plasma testosterone concentrations are similar in balding and non-balding men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], elevated levels of unbound testosterone (the active fraction of testosterone) have been detected in some men with androgenetic alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21714548\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetics play an important role in male androgenetic alopecia. In one study of approximately 500 monozygotic male twins and 400 dizygotic male twins between the ages of 25 and 36, 80 percent of the variance in the extent of hair loss was attributed to genetic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Both maternal and paternal genetics appear to be involved and the mode of inheritance is best viewed as polygenic with variable penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,27</a>].</p><p>Numerous studies have identified genetic susceptibility loci for androgenetic alopecia including the androgen receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">(AR)/EDAR2</span> locus on the X chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] , the <span class=\"nowrap\">PAX1/FOXA2</span> locus on chromosome 20p11 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], and HDAC9 gene on chromosome 7p21.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Chromosome 3q26 may also have a contributory role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21714555\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Androgenetic alopecia is characterized by varying degrees of hair thinning and nonscarring terminal hair loss that typically begins in the temporal scalp, midfrontal scalp, or vertex area of the scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83802%7EDERM%2F83804%7EDERM%2F63010%7EDERM%2F83805\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83802 graphicRef83804 graphicRef63010 graphicRef83805 \">picture 1A-D</a>). The severity of involvement of these three areas is highly variable; some men bald more at the vertex and other men exhibit the most severe hair loss anteriorly. It is important to note that the vast majority (96 percent) of Caucasian men develop a minor amount of recession of the frontal hairline and temples after puberty (less than 2 cm); this has been termed &quot;hairline maturation&quot; and does not correlate with the future development of androgenetic alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The midoccipital scalp is not usually affected in men with androgenetic alopecia, which allows for the transplantation of occipital hairs to other areas of the scalp during surgical hair restoration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men#H335327\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p>The Hamilton-Norwood scale provides a helpful guide to classify male pattern hair loss. The scale divides the clinical findings into seven stages and offers a visual depiction of the sequential stages of balding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86709\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86709 \">figure 2</a>). The scale also describes a less common type A variant of hair loss in which men demonstrate only the progressive movement of the anterior hairline posteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86709\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86709 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, not all men with androgenetic alopecia follow the hair loss patterns outlined by the Hamilton-Norwood scale. For example, 10 percent of men have a pattern that resembles female androgenetic alopecia (preservation of the frontal hairline and terminal hair loss in the central scalp) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Androgenetic alopecia is a continuous process that slowly progresses over the course of many years. It occurs in waves of activity, with some men noticing more rapid intervals of hair loss at certain times of their lives followed by periods of minimal activity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21714562\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of androgenetic alopecia in males is usually straightforward and can be made by obtaining a history from the patient and performing an examination of the patient&rsquo;s hair and scalp. A history of slowly progressive, patterned hair loss with evidence of follicular miniaturization and a negative hair pull test on examination is highly suggestive of androgenetic alopecia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H638534\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Hair pull test'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21714569\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Follicular miniaturization is one of the earliest signs of androgenetic alopecia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83781\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83781 \">picture 2</a>). The presence of miniaturized hairs can be seen either by examining the caliber of hair fibers against a color contrasting background or by using a handheld microscope or dermatoscope. Dermoscopy may reveal anisotrichosis (variations in hair follicle diameter) long before hair loss becomes clinically visible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The miniaturized hairs can be of various lengths and diameters since the effects on individual follicles are independent. The presence of uneven hair lengths and texture is consistent with androgenetic alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A family history of similar hair loss is often present in men with androgenetic alopecia (see <a href=\"#H21714527\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above). Rapid hair loss or hair loss accompanied by itching, burning, or scalp tenderness requires further evaluation since these features are not associated with androgenetic alopecia.</p><p>Dermoscopy of the scalp (also known as trichoscopy) may be useful for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Dermoscopic features of male androgenetic alopecia include hair diameter diversity, perifollicular <span class=\"nowrap\">pigmentation/peripilar</span> signs, and yellow dots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Focal atrichia may also be present.

However, since androgenetic alopecia has distinctive histological features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>], biopsies can be used to confirm the diagnosis in the infrequent cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain. </p><p>A 4 mm punch biopsy is the preferred procedure for obtaining a tissue specimen for diagnosis. We usually obtain two biopsies, one for horizontal (transverse) sectioning and one for vertical sectioning. Horizontal sectioning of the tissue specimen allows for visualization of more follicles and tends to yield more useful results than vertical sectioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Horizontal sections </strong>&ndash; The histological features of androgenetic alopecia are more readily seen in horizontal sections. Depending on the severity of the clinical findings, these show a variable mixture of terminal, vellus, and vellus-like hair follicles in the dermis. The vellus and vellus-like hairs are less than 0.03 mm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Terminal hairs (greater than 0.06 mm) are seen in the reticular dermis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The ratios of anagen to telogen (A:T) hair follicles and terminal to vellus (T:V) hair follicles are altered in androgenetic alopecia and can be readily evaluated with horizontal sections. In the course of androgenetic alopecia, the A:T ratio is reduced from 12:1 to less than 5:1. The T:V ratio is reduced from 7:1 to less than 2.5:1 in more advanced cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These alterations in the T:V ratio can be extremely helpful in the diagnosis of androgenetic alopecia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vertical sections </strong>&ndash; Vertical sections show terminal hair follicles rooted in the subcutaneous and reticular dermis and vellus hair follicles located more superficially in the papillary dermis. Vertical columns of connective tissue, known as follicular stelae or follicular streamers can be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,41</a>]. In androgenetic alopecia, the follicular stelae that originate in the deep dermis and underlie vellus hairs in the more superficial dermis may represent connective tissue that previously surrounded terminal hair follicles prior to miniaturization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p/><p>Inflammation is not uncommon in histologic specimens from androgenetic alopecia despite the fact it is classified as a noninflammatory form of hair loss. Mild perifollicular lymphohistiocytic inflammation is present in one-third of biopsies and moderate inflammation is present in approximately 40 percent of specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This inflammation differs significantly from the intense peribulbar inflammation that is typically found in alopecia areata. Mild, perifollicular fibrosis is an additional feature that may be detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This fibrosis differs from the extensive scarring with obliteration of hair follicles seen in cicatricial alopecias. </p><p>The presence of inflammation or fibrosis may have prognostic significance in androgenetic alopecia. In a study of male patients with androgenetic alopecia treated with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a>, 55 percent of 22 men with inflammation or fibrosis responded to minoxidil compared with 77 percent of 22 men without histopathologic evidence for inflammation or fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Further studies are necessary to confirm this finding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21714583\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common hair disorders in the differential diagnosis of androgenetic alopecia are diffuse alopecia areata and telogen effluvium. It is important to remember that androgenetic alopecia may coexist with these conditions, further adding to the challenge of diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21714590\"><span class=\"h3\">Diffuse alopecia areata</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse alopecia areata is usually more acute in onset than androgenetic alopecia, typically does not follow a patterned distribution, and may be associated with hair loss on other body sites. Nail pitting may occur in alopecia areata, but is not a feature of androgenetic alopecia. Miniaturized hairs can be seen in both alopecia areata and androgenetic alopecia. A punch biopsy is helpful in difficult cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alopecia areata&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21714597\"><span class=\"h3\">Telogen effluvium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the patterned hair loss of androgenetic alopecia, telogen effluvium generally leads to hair loss over the entire scalp, resulting in reduced hair volume. Telogen effluvium is usually associated with an acute event and the results of the hair pull test are positive. A history of a precipitating event or drug is helpful. A biopsy may assist with distinguishing androgenetic alopecia from telogen effluvium.

The prevalence of male androgenetic alopecia varies among ethnicities. (See <a href=\"#H21714527\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both hormonal and genetic factors contribute to the development of male androgenetic alopecia. The effects of dihydrotestosterone on susceptible follicles leads to follicular miniaturization, which manifests clinically as the replacement of terminal hairs by short, thin (vellus) hairs. (See <a href=\"#H21714534\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inheritance of male androgenetic alopecia is complex and likely involves both paternal and maternal factors. The mode of inheritance is best described as polygenic with variable penetrance. (See <a href=\"#H21714548\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The appearance of male androgenetic alopecia varies among individuals. The temporal, anterior, mid scalp, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vertex areas of the scalp are typically affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83802%7EDERM%2F83804%7EDERM%2F63010%7EDERM%2F83805\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83802 graphicRef83804 graphicRef63010 graphicRef83805 \">picture 1A-D</a>). The occipital scalp is usually spared. The loss of terminal hairs slowly progresses over the course of years. (See <a href=\"#H21714555\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of androgenetic alopecia is usually made clinically. For the infrequent cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain, a biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Horizontal sectioning of the biopsy specimen is preferred. (See <a href=\"#H21714562\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An association between androgenetic alopecia and cardiovascular disease has been reported. Although there are no specific guidelines for the detection or prevention of cardiovascular disease in men with androgenetic alopecia, clinicians should remain cognizant of the possibility of an increased risk in this population.
