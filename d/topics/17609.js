Most patients with HFpEF also display normal LV volumes and evidence of diastolic dysfunction (eg, abnormal pattern of LV filling and elevated filling pressures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8</a>]. By contrast, HF with a reduced EF (HFrEF) is characterized by increased LV volumes and reduced EF. Previously, HFpEF was termed &quot;diastolic HF&quot; and HFrEF was described as &quot;systolic HF.&quot; </p><p>HFpEF should be distinguished from other causes of HF with an LVEF &gt;50 percent such as valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, and high output HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54975\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54975 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of patients with HFpEF will be reviewed here. Issues related to etiology, prevalence, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and pathophysiology are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellular-mechanisms-of-diastolic-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellular mechanisms of diastolic dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials in HFpEF have produced neutral results to date and treatment is largely directed toward associated conditions (eg, hypertension) and symptoms (eg, edema). Recommendations for pharmacologic therapy are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H777472241\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>This approach is consistent with recommendations for treatment of patients with HFpEF included in the 2013 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> HF guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The following two strong recommendations were included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic and diastolic hypertension should be controlled in accordance with published clinical practice guidelines to prevent morbidity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretics should be used to relieve symptoms due to volume overload.</p><p/><p>Similar recommendations were included in the 2016 European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The management of HFpEF differs from the management of HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) given differences in the evidence base for therapy. The results of clinical trials have demonstrated that while neurohumoral antagonists such as beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as well as cardiac resynchronization are effective in HFrEF, these therapies do not decrease morbidity and mortality in HFpEF. These data suggest that there are fundamental differences in the pathophysiology underlying HFrEF versus HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. All the therapies that improve mortality in HFrEF also reverse the LV dilatation in HFrEF. Since patients with HFpEF either have no or minimal LV dilatation, it may not be surprising that these agents have not been as effective in HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Although asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction is a risk factor for development of HFpEF and mortality (see <a href=\"#H13537491\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction'</a> below), data are lacking on the efficacy of therapy to reduce the risk of progression to HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519925273\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important component of treating a patient with HFpEF is treating the contributing factors and comorbidities that are frequently present and significantly impact the clinical course. The most common include hypertension, lung disease, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation (AF), obesity, anemia, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and sleep disordered breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These comorbidities have an important impact on the clinical course, and the majority of subsequent hospitalizations in patients with HFpEF are not due to HF. The impact of statins and exercise training may be mediated through effects on the comorbidities. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519925750\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lowering systemic blood pressure reduced the rate of the subsequent development of HF in several large randomized hypertension treatment trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. The choice of a specific antihypertensive agent must be individualized in the presence of coexisting diseases such as diabetes mellitus or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, there may be class specific effects. In ancillary analysis of data from the ALLHAT trial, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> reduced the incidence of new-onset HFpEF compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxazosin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], whereas both lisinopril and the chlorthalidone were effective in reducing the incidence of HFrEF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to remember that the studies above deal with HFpEF prevention rather than treatment. At this time, there is no compelling evidence that hypertension control improves signs or symptoms of HF in patients with HFpEF. Indeed, previous placebo-controlled trials testing neurohumoral antagonists that lower blood pressure did not show any effect on HF severity end points despite documented reductions in blood pressure.</p><p>The uncertain clinical significance of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the treatment of hypertension is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical implications and treatment of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519925894\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrial fibrillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AF is common in HFpEF, identified at some time point in two-thirds of patients, and its presence is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. As suggested in the 2013 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> HF guidelines, AF is managed in patients with HFpEF according to published clinical practice guidelines to improve symptomatic HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. LV filling in HFpEF occurs largely in late diastole and is more dependent than normal hearts on atrial contraction. Tachycardia is also deleterious by shortening the time of diastole. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>For these reasons, restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm are preferred when AF occurs in patients with HFpEF. When this cannot be achieved, rate control becomes important. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are the usual first-line agents, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> most often being used in patients with HFrEF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation: Recommendations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A combination of these drugs may be required to achieve adequate heart rate control. It is important to measure heart rate during moderate exercise and not to base heart rate control solely on values obtained in the resting state.</p><p>An important component of the management of AF, regardless of whether rhythm control or rate control is chosen, is anticoagulation to prevent systemic embolization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519925981\"><span class=\"h3\">Myocardial ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myocardial ischemia in HFpEF can result from epicardial CAD, high wall stress, or microvascular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common among patients with HFpEF. As an example, a series of patients with HFpEF reported that two-thirds of patients had anatomically significant CAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The presence of CAD was an independent predictor of increased mortality, along with greater deterioration in LV systolic function over time.</p><p>Patients with HFpEF and symptoms and signs of ischemia are treated with standard therapy including beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. Nitrates are often prescribed, but the reduction in preload can lead to hypotension in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with coronary artery disease with drug-resistant ischemic HFpEF may require coronary revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a single-center, retrospective series, revascularization was associated with improved survival and less deterioration in EF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, prospective trial data are not available regarding the effects of revascularization in HFpEF.

However, observational data suggest that statins might be of benefit in patients with HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Randomized trials are required to confirm these observations. We recommend use of statins in patients with HFpEF who have an indication for statin therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statin-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statin therapy in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519925283\"><span class=\"h2\">Conditions to avoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management includes avoidance and treatment of common precipitants of HF exacerbations such as tachycardia, abrupt severe elevations in systemic blood pressure, ischemia, and AF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Caveats include avoidance of excessive preload reduction. The patient who has LV diastolic dysfunction with a small, stiff LV chamber may be particularly susceptible to excessive preload reduction, which can lead to underfilling of the LV, a fall in cardiac output, and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In patients with severe LVH due to hypertension or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, excessive preload reduction can also create subaortic outflow obstruction. For these reasons, diuretics or venodilators such as nitrates and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers must be administered with caution. Careful attention is required for symptoms of ventricular underfilling such as weakness, dizziness, near syncope, and syncope. Overdiuresis can also result in prerenal azotemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment#H17931529\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiorenal syndrome: Prognosis and treatment&quot;, section on 'Diuretics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519926288\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise training improves exercise capacity and quality of life in HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. For patients who are able to exercise, we offer referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program including dynamic exercise training. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation in patients with heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-programs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation programs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During exercise in healthy individuals, diastolic function is enhanced so that LV input remains precisely matched to LV output, despite the shortened duration of diastole resulting from the associated tachycardia. This is achieved in the normal LV by a rapid and marked decrease in intraventricular pressure during early diastole, thereby creating a greater LV &quot;suction&quot; effect, which enhances the transmitral pressure gradient without increasing left atrial pressure. This mechanism is lost in patients with diastolic dysfunction; as a result, dyspnea with exertion is often their most common complaint. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Normal response to exercise'</a>.) </p><p>Exercise training is the only intervention shown to improve exercise capacity and quality of life in HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Several small randomized trials suggest that exercise training improves functional capacity and quality of life in patients with HFpEF without any clear effects on cardiac function, as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H113444405\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'For heart failure with preserved or mid-range ejection fraction'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3659871008\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For obese patients with HFpEF, weight loss may be helpful. As compared with non-obese HFpEF patients, those with obesity display more profound HF severity, including greater plasma volume expansion, more abnormal hemodynamics, and worse exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A trial reported improvements in exercise capacity and reduction in fat mass with caloric restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], but further study regarding different methods to achieve weight loss is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519926427\"><span class=\"h2\">Serial assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with HFpEF should be evaluated periodically to assess status, the response to therapy, and potential need for changes in management. Each visit should include assessment of ability to perform activity of daily living, volume status and weight, current use of medications, alcohol, tobacco, illicit drugs, and alternative therapies, as well as diet and sodium intake.</p><p>Monitoring of serum natriuretic peptide levels to optimize medical therapy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure#H27657882\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure&quot;, section on 'Chronic HF'</a>.)</p><p>The CHAMPION randomized trial found that use of an implantable hemodynamic monitor decreased HF hospitalizations in a population of patients that included patients with HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The reasons for possible efficacy may include more appropriate titration of medications as well as earlier recognition of problems.

Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for all patients with HF. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all individuals six months of age and older.

Based upon the available evidence, we suggest treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist in patients with HFpEF who can be appropriately monitored. Diuretics are used to treat volume overload, but as noted above, care must be taken to avoid volume depletion. Other medications such as ARBs, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and beta blockers are used as need to treat hypertension but lack proven efficacy to alter clinical outcomes in HFpEF. We recommend against use of phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors, organic nitrates such as isosorbide, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> (aside from use for ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation) to treat HFpEF.

The study was conducted in 206 patients from the United States and Canada and 160 patients from Russia.

Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (The Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-and-atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Heart failure and atrial fibrillation (The Basics)&quot;</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beyond the Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8053301\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An important component of treating a patient with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is treating the contributing factors and comorbidities that are frequently present and significantly impact the clinical course. The most common include hypertension, lung disease, coronary artery disease, obesity, anemia, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and sleep disordered breathing. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Treatment overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of HFpEF is largely governed by management of associated conditions and symptoms since trial data are limited. The general principles for treatment of HFpEF are control of pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema with diuretics, treatment of systolic hypertension, prevention of rapid heart rates, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation, and coronary revascularization in patients with coronary heart disease with ischemia judged to contribute to symptoms of HF. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Treatment overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An important caveat is that the patient who has left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction with a small, stiff LV chamber is particularly susceptible to excessive preload reduction, which can lead sequentially to underfilling of the LV, a fall in cardiac output, and hypotension. As such, if diuretic or venodilators such as nitrates are indicated, they must be administered with caution. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Treatment overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm is preferred when atrial fibrillation occurs in patients with HFpEF. When this cannot be achieved, rate control becomes important. (See <a href=\"#H519925894\" class=\"local\">'Atrial fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not using a beta blocker for HFpEF in the absence of an alternative indication, such as angina (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with clear evidence of HFpEF (including increased brain natriuretic peptide) who can be carefully monitored for changes in serum potassium and renal function, we suggest treatment with a mineralocorticoid antagonist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H777472318\" class=\"local\">'Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend against use of organic nitrates, phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> (except for ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation) to treat patients with HFpEF (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H885140013\" class=\"local\">'Ineffective drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise training is the only intervention shown to consistently improve exercise capacity and quality of life in HFpEF. For patients who are able to exercise, we offer referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program including dynamic exercise training. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-programs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation programs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H519926288\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac rehabilitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic LV diastolic dysfunction is a predictor of future cardiovascular morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H13537491\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with HFpEF experience morbidities (eg, hospitalization for HF) at a rate that is virtually the same as that seen in patients with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF). Mortality rates in both HFpEF and HFrEF are high; published data on differences in mortality rates are conflicting. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients (ie, HFpEF)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14384738\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would like to thank Drs.
