They most frequently occur on the heels and soles of the feet due to friction from shoes and socks during walking or running. They may also occur on the toes, especially with improper fitting footwear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/forefoot-and-midfoot-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-overview-of-causes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For example, narrow shoes cause blisters on the outside portions of the great and little toes; shoes that are too big may cause blisters on the tips of the toes from the foot sliding within the shoe. Blisters can be prevented by ensuring that shoes fit properly and that socks stay dry. Socks that wick moisture away from the skin (eg, acrylic, polyester, or wool socks worn over polyester socks) also decrease the likelihood of a blister.

Typical objects causing these injuries include nails, pins, other metal objects, wood, stones, and glass. These wounds have a significant risk for infection. When evaluating plantar puncture wounds in children and adolescents the clinician should determine when the injury occurred, whether the patient was barefoot or wearing shoes, and what object caused the wound, if known. The wound should be examined with the patient prone and, for actively bleeding wounds, a tourniquet or blood pressure cuff applied so that the field is bloodless. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications of puncture wounds&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds#H29291341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications of puncture wounds&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Imaging is warranted when there is a clinical suspicion of a retained foreign body. Plain radiographs can detect many radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, glass, stones, or metallic objects). Wood, plastic, and other radiolucent objects can be located with ultrasound. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are also helpful methods of localizing a retained foreign body when plain radiographs or ultrasound fail. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot be used when metallic objects are present.

Typically, nonabsorbable sutures are used for wound closure and are kept in place for approximately 10 days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closure of minor skin wounds with sutures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lacerations to the sole of the foot frequently involve cuts caused by sharp objects that the patient steps on while barefoot and foreign bodies are an important consideration. Imaging is warranted when there is a clinical suspicion of a retained foreign body. Plain radiographs can detect many radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, glass, stones, or metallic objects). Wood, plastic, and other radiolucent objects can be located with ultrasound. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are also helpful methods of localizing a retained foreign body when plain radiographs or ultrasound fail.

A posterior tibial nerve block provides an alternative approach that may provide better pain control during the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques#H1413150773\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity nerve blocks: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Ankle block'</a>.)</p><p>Lower extremity wounds are more prone to infection than lacerations with better perfusion (eg, face or scalp lacerations). Thus, patients should have a wound check within a few days of wound closure and should be given careful instructions regarding proper wound care, including no swimming, no immersion while bathing, and how to monitor for infection.

Depending upon the severity of injury, there is some degree of swelling, discoloration, and tenderness around the first MTP joint. Passive extension of the great toe may be limited in the acute setting and is most painful. Passive gliding of the first MTP joint in a plantar direction along the plane of the joint can be performed to assess the stability of the plantar ligament complex.</p><p>The sprain is graded as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I &ndash; Sprain of the plantar capsular ligament complex that is painful but not disabling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II &ndash; Partial rupture of the plantar capsular ligament complex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III &ndash; Sprain with severe swelling and ecchymosis, weakness of great toe flexion, and instability of the first MTP joint</p><p/><p>The management of first metatarsophalangeal joint sprain is discussed separately.

The ligaments that connect the tarso-metatarsal joints are disrupted with Lisfranc sprains. The Lisfranc ligament complex attaches the lateral aspect of the medial cuneiform to the medial aspect of the proximal second metatarsal. They may be injured when the foot is plantar-flexed and excessive weight or axial force is applied to the joint (eg, player falling onto the heel of a plantar-flexed foot) or if the forefoot is pinned and the body is pulled backwards (eg, falling backwards off a windsurfing board or horse while the foot remains in the foot strap or stirrup).

While often absent in isolated tarsometatarsal (TMT) sprains, plantar ecchymosis is essentially pathognomonic for Lisfranc injuries. When a Lisfranc injury is suspected, the clinician should carefully assess the dorsalis pedis pulse and for the presence of a compartment syndrome.

Ecchymosis and swelling are usually present and occur within the first few hours after injury. Palpation along the foot or digit frequently reveals point tenderness at the fracture site. However, the dorsum of the foot or toe may be diffusely swollen and tender, making it difficult to pinpoint the fracture location by examination alone. Of note, tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal after an inversion injury is highly suggestive of a fracture and may <strong>not</strong> be accompanied by significant swelling soon after the injury. With displaced fractures and dislocations, deformity is usually apparent.

Any wound should be carefully examined to exclude communication with the fracture site (ie, an open fracture). Devitalized skin may slough and convert a closed fracture into an open one. Injury to surrounding soft tissue including the nail and nail bed can occur, particularly with crush injuries. Subungual hematoma is often a marker of an underlying distal phalanx fracture.

Overpronation and tight shoes are often associated with the condition.</p><p>Ultrasound offers an inexpensive option for identifying Morton neuroma with accuracy comparable to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and can help to distinguish a neuroma from intra-metatarsal bursal swelling or synovitis in<em> </em>adjacent joints.</p><p>Morton neuroma is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-forefoot-pain-in-adults#H308762690\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of forefoot pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Morton neuroma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15751464\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foot pain in the young athlete can originate in the bones (fractures), ligaments (sprains), muscles and tendons, or fascia. Careful localization of the pain can help to narrow the differential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63409\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63409 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71857\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71857 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H481178505\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common acute injuries of the mid- and forefoot in children and adolescents consist of friction blisters, wounds to the sole of the foot, stubbed toes with subungual hematoma or phalangeal fractures, and metatarsal fractures. Forced hyperextension of the first toe may cause a metatarsophalangeal joint sprain. Lisfranc complex injuries are less commonly seen but warrant prompt referral to an orthopedic surgeon with pediatric expertise. (See <a href=\"#H481178547\" class=\"local\">'Acute injuries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overuse injuries of the mid- and forefoot include flexor hallucis longus tendinitis and tibialis posterior tendinitis. Less commonly, children and adolescents can develop plantar fasciitis and flexor digitorum longus tendinitis. (See <a href=\"#H481178554\" class=\"local\">'Overuse injuries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among arch abnormalities, flexible pes planus (flat feet) is most common and typically describes functional flat feet that are physiologic and asymptomatic. Patients with painful flexible pes planus warrant evaluation for associated ligamentous laxity, tight heel cords, and tibialis posterior tendon dysfunction. Rigid pes planus (flat feet) and pes cavus (fixed high arch) warrant specialty referral to evaluate underlying abnormalities such as tarsal coalition (pes planus), neuromuscular disease (pes cavus), or talipes equinovarus (residual club foot causing pes cavus). (See <a href=\"#H13694411\" class=\"local\">'Arch abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bony abnormalities that may occur in children and adolescents include K&ouml;hler disease (navicular osteochondrosis, primarily seen in children younger than 10 years of age) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64819\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64819 \">image 2</a>), Freiberg disease or Freiberg infraction (metatarsal avascular necrosis), Iselin disease (fifth metatarsal traction apophysitis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F102855\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef102855 \">image 3</a>), bunions, bunionettes, and sesamoiditis (sesamoid stress fracture). Tarsal coalition, a fibrous bony connection between two or more of the tarsal bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F52540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52540 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66078\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66078 \">image 1</a>), is a condition that is present at birth but becomes symptomatic only during the second decade as the coalition(s) ossify. Patients with tarsal coalition often present with rigid flat feet. (See <a href=\"#H481178561\" class=\"local\">'Bone conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous or deeper infections (cellulitis or abscess) involving the sole of the foot frequently follow disruption of the skin (eg, blister, puncture wound, or insect bite) or may arise from a retained foreign body such as a splinter, rock, or piece of glass. Extension of infection may cause an osteomyelitis. Plantar warts commonly occur on pressure points in the ball of the foot and the heel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53424\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53424 \">picture 8</a>). Tarsal tunnel syndrome and Morton neuroma are neuropathies caused by compression or inflammation of the tibial nerve or interdigital nerve, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H481178568\" class=\"local\">'Infectious and neurologic conditions'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Clinically Oriented Anatomy, 7th ed, Moore KL, Dalley II AF, Agur AMR (Eds), Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia 2014.</li><li class=\"breakAll\">Lipman GS, Krabak BJ.
