However, up to 10 percent of adults in the United States abuse ethanol, and worldwide acute ethanol intoxication is associated with numerous complications, including traffic accidents, domestic violence, homicide, and suicide. Death from alcohol poisoning remains a major concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Uncomplicated ethanol intoxication is estimated to be responsible for over 600,000 emergency department visits each year in the United States alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-benefits-and-risks-of-moderate-alcohol-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular benefits and risks of moderate alcohol consumption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risky-drinking-and-alcohol-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An overview of the pathophysiology, clinical features and management of acute ethanol intoxication in adults will be presented here. The health effects of chronic alcohol abuse, the recognition and management of alcohol withdrawal, and ethanol intoxication in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethanol-intoxication-in-children-epidemiology-estimation-of-toxicity-and-toxic-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethanol intoxication in children: Epidemiology, estimation of toxicity, and toxic effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the Department of Health and Human Services and the United States Department of Agriculture, one standard drink contains approximately 0.5 ounces of ethanol&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This corresponds to 12 fluid ounces of regular beer, 5 fluid ounces of wine, or 1.5 fluid ounces of 80-proof distilled spirit. In the United States, powdered alcohol was approved by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau in 2015 under the brand name Palcohol. These products are typically 50 percent alcohol by weight and are intended to be mixed to form a product that is 10 percent alcohol by volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Ethanol is also found in a variety of common household products, including mouthwash, perfume, cologne, cooking extracts, and over-the-counter medications.</p><p>Ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH) is a water-soluble alcohol that rapidly crosses cell membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Absorption of ethanol occurs via the gastrointestinal system, primarily in the duodenum and remainder of the small intestine (approximately 80 percent) and stomach (approximately 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. When the stomach is empty, peak blood ethanol levels are reached between 30 and 90 minutes after ingestion. There are no data on how the absorption of powdered alcohol may differ from its liquid form, but presumably the absorption is similar.</p><p>The primary pathway of ethanol metabolism occurs in the liver via alcohol dehydrogenase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although the majority of ethanol metabolism is hepatic, other tissues do contribute. Alcohol dehydrogenase is also located in the gastric mucosa. The enzyme is found in decreased quantities in women. Less &quot;first-pass metabolism&quot;, combined with a smaller volume of distribution, may explain the enhanced vulnerability of women to acute complications of alcohol intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-alcoholic-liver-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Alcohol metabolism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ethanol intoxication is common among patients requiring emergency care, although it is rarely the primary reason for acute presentation. In one study, ethanol was detected in 15 to 40 percent of unselected emergency department patients, depending on geographical location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Binge drinking, which is generally defined as consuming &ge;5 alcoholic drinks on a single occasion, generally results in acute intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Signs and symptoms of acute ethanol intoxication vary with severity and can include slurred speech, nystagmus, disinhibited behavior, incoordination, unsteady gait, memory impairment, stupor, or coma. Hypotension and tachycardia may occur as a result of ethanol-induced peripheral vasodilation, or secondary to volume loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Signs associated with particular serum ethanol concentrations in nonalcoholics are described below. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Serum alcohol concentration and associated signs'</a> below.)</p><p>Acute alcohol intoxication can also induce multiple metabolic derangements including hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fasting-ketosis-and-alcoholic-ketoacidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fasting ketosis and alcoholic ketoacidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: A CRITICAL CONSIDERATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol intoxication as a cause of altered mental status is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be considered only after ruling out more serious conditions such as head trauma, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, hepatic encephalopathy, and other metabolic and physiologic derangements. For head trauma in particular, existing clinical decision rules such as the Canadian CT Head Rule and NEXUS criteria may not have adequate sensitivity in intoxicated patients with minor head injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, intoxication with other alcohols (methanol or ethylene glycol) should be suspected in patients with severe metabolic acidosis and an increased anion gap. Similarly, isopropyl alcohol ingestion should be suspected in a patient with unexpectedly increased levels of serum ketones or acetone without metabolic acidosis in the setting of clinical alcohol intoxication. All alcohol poisonings are associated with an increased osmolal gap, if the patient presents soon after the ingestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52568\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52568 \">table 1</a>). Of note, other drugs are often ingested or otherwise taken along with alcohol, and appropriate evaluation should be performed as indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Isopropyl alcohol poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-osmolal-gap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum osmolal gap&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of the critically ill adult with an unknown overdose&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20503888\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum alcohol concentration and associated signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurements from serum provide the most accurate determination of a patient&rsquo;s alcohol level. Alternative methods, such as breath analysis, provide more rapid results, but often give slightly lower ethanol concentrations than those obtained from venous blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In most of the United States, the legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit is 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. </p><p>The signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication vary widely depending upon: the patient&rsquo;s genetics; the type, amount, and rate of alcohol intake; and the frequency and pattern of alcohol use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In individuals who do not abuse alcohol, the clinical effects of ethanol intoxication are relatively more predictable. Conversely, the effects of inebriation on individuals with a history of chronic alcohol abuse are unpredictable and such patients may demonstrate little clinical evidence of intoxication even with BACs over 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (88 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p>Among patients who do not abuse alcohol, clinical signs often associated with particular ranges of the BAC are as follow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64642\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64642 \">table 2</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a BAC between 0.01 and 0.10 percent (&lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> euphoria and mild deficits in coordination, attention, and cognition may be observed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a BAC between 0.10 and 0.20 percent, an individual experiences greater deficits in coordination and psychomotor skills, decreased attention, ataxia, impaired judgment, slurred speech, and mood variability. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a BAC between 0.20 to 0.30 percent, severe alcohol intoxication results in a lack of coordination, incoherent thoughts, confusion, and nausea and vomiting. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the BAC exceeds 0.30 percent, stupor and loss of consciousness can occur. Some patients experience coma and respiratory depression, and death is possible. </p><p/><p>It should be noted that the clinical signs and symptoms of alcohol intoxication may <strong>not</strong> correlate with the BAC depending upon the factors described above and whether the concentration is increasing or decreasing; effects may be more prominent when levels are rising (so-called Mellanby effect).</p><p>It is also important to recognize that co-ingestion of other substances such as sympathomimetic drugs, opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and &lsquo;designer drugs&rsquo; may either antagonize or augment the effects of alcohol, making the BAC an unreliable predictor of clinical symptoms. As one important example, the use of alcohol mixed with energy drinks (AmEDs), particularly among young adults and adolescents, has been increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and the combined effects of caffeine and ethanol can present a complex clinical picture. While caffeine may antagonize some effects of alcohol, other potentially harmful effects likely persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Overall, it remains unclear to what extent AmEDs affect alcohol-induced psychomotor impairment and sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20503981\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory studies are usually unnecessary in patients with an isolated mild ethanol intoxication. For patients with moderate to severe but uncomplicated ethanol intoxication (ie, not requiring intubation, not initially hypoglycemic, no history or clinical signs of trauma), we initially obtain a serum ethanol concentration and basic chemistry studies (serum glucose, basic electrolytes). Thereafter, assuming no initial laboratory abnormalities, a serum glucose concentration can be monitored every eight hours, while serum electrolytes do not need to be remeasured. This approach assumes that the patient is purely &quot;intoxicated&quot; and does not develop any acute changes in clinical status (eg, seizures).&nbsp;Patients with significant concomitant problems require more intensive monitoring based upon their comorbidities and injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general approach to any poisoned patient must include the following elements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation: including recognition that poisoning has occurred, identification of the agent (or agents) involved, assessment of the severity, and prediction of toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management: consisting of supportive care, prevention of drug absorption, and when appropriate, the administration of antidotes and enhancement of drug elimination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal decontamination of the poisoned patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enhanced-elimination-of-poisons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enhanced elimination of poisons&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The treatment for isolated acute ethanol intoxication is primarily supportive. As a general rule, all intoxicated patients should receive a rapid bedside glucose determination, followed by dextrose infusion if hypoglycemia is present. In addition, all patients presenting with acute ethanol intoxication should be carefully assessed for occult traumatic injuries and should be asked whether they have ingested or otherwise taken other drugs or potentially harmful substances. Patients presenting with coma secondary to ethanol intoxication should receive at least 100 mg of parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> to prevent or treat Wernicke's encephalopathy, along with dextrose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wernicke-encephalopathy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wernicke encephalopathy&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wernicke-encephalopathy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wernicke encephalopathy&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with acute ethanol intoxication and altered sensorium can be agitated, violent, and uncooperative. In such cases, the use of chemical sedation may be needed to prevent the patient from harming themselves or others. Benzodiazepines and typical antipsychotics are frequently used in these patients, but caution must be taken as these drugs can worsen the respiratory depression caused by alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-emergency-management-of-the-acutely-agitated-or-violent-adult#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and emergency management of the acutely agitated or violent adult&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>Once the acute intoxication is managed, appropriate evaluation or referral for possible substance abuse should be made. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Efficacy, adverse effects, and administration&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risky-drinking-and-alcohol-use-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risky drinking and alcohol use disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild ethanol intoxication and ethanol clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with mild ethanol intoxication will require only observation and serial examination until clinical sobriety has been achieved. In patients with a clear history of alcohol intake and mild ethanol intoxication, and without signs of volume depletion, intravenous (IV) catheter insertion and fluid hydration are not usually necessary.</p><p>There is wide variation in the metabolism of ethanol. The unhabituated drinker clears ethanol from the blood stream at an approximate rate of 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3 to 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> per hour. Patients with chronic ethanol abuse can clear ethanol at a rate of 25 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.5 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> per hour, or even faster in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, the disposition of these patients should not be based solely on the measured (or calculated) serum alcohol concentration. Patients with mild intoxication can be safely discharged when no longer clinically intoxicated and deemed by the clinician to be no danger to themselves or others. Ideally, the patient should be discharged into the care of a competent, sober individual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderate ethanol intoxication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with moderate ethanol intoxication with signs of volume depletion, hypotension or malnutrition may require IV catheter insertion and fluid hydration. At a moderate to severe level of intoxication any alteration in the level of consciousness must be further investigated.</p><p>If there is a clear history of alcohol consumption and serial examinations demonstrate improvement in the patient's mental status, further work-up and routine laboratory tests may not be necessary. However, if there is any question of possible occult trauma or if the patient's mental status does not improve after serial examinations, a computed tomographic scan of the head should be obtained, along with other diagnostic tests as indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe ethanol intoxication (ethanol poisoning)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with severe ethanol intoxication must be provided aggressive supportive care. At high BACs, special attention must be paid to the patient&rsquo;s respiratory status, including frequent reassessment of the airway and breathing. If the patient is unable to protect their airway or has inadequate respiration, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are required. </p><p>In patients with evidence of volume depletion or hypotension, IV hydration with isotonic crystalloid is given. All patients presenting with coma secondary to ethanol intoxication should receive parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> to prevent or treat Wernicke's encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wernicke-encephalopathy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wernicke encephalopathy&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wernicke-encephalopathy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wernicke encephalopathy&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with severe intoxication, activated charcoal and gastric lavage are generally <strong>NOT </strong>helpful because of the rapid rate of absorption of ethanol from the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with severe intoxication requiring aggressive supportive care may be kept in the Emergency Department in an observation unit or admitted to the hospital. Most patients presenting with coma or other significant complications of ethanol intoxication require admission for close monitoring until sobriety is achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE DIRECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute and chronic effects of alcohol abuse result in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Efforts have been made to create novel therapies that accelerate the clearance of alcohol. As an example, metadoxine, a pyrrolidone carboxylate of pyridoxine, appears to be safe and effective in lowering blood alcohol levels and improving symptoms following acute intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in humans with acute alcohol intoxication, metadoxine decreased the half-life of ethanol in the blood, resulting in more rapid ethanol clearance and faster recovery times compared to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethanol-intoxication-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Metadoxine is not yet approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute ethanol intoxication, and its use should be considered experimental.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3683710\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients who are critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222). In addition, some hospitals have clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inpatient care. Whenever available, these are invaluable resources to help in the diagnosis and management of ingestions or overdoses.
