Before you can start using your inhaler, you need to put in the cartridge. This is the part that contains the medicine. To do this:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press the safety catch on the side of the inhaler. This releases the clear plastic base.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the base</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Push the narrow end of the cartridge into the inhaler until it clicks </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Push on the cartridge to make sure it is in all the way. You can press it against a table top or other hard surface to do this.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put the clear plastic base back on, and press until you hear a click</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the cartridge is in the inhaler, do not remove it or the base again.</p><p/><p>Also, before you use your soft mist inhaler for the first time, you need to prepare it to release the right dose of medicine. This is called &quot;priming.&quot; To prime your inhaler:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the inhaler upright with the cap closed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twist the clear base to the right until it clicks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open the cap and point the inhaler at the floor, away from your face</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press the button on the side until you see a mist come out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeat these steps 3 more times</p><p/><p>If you have not used your inhaler for more than <strong>3 days</strong>, you should do 1 &quot;priming cycle&quot; before using it. That means following the first 4 steps above to release 1 spray of medicine.</p><p>If you have not used your inhaler for more than <strong>3 weeks</strong>, do all the steps above. That means going through the priming cycle and repeating it for a total of 4 sprays of medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2086494268\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I use a soft mist inhaler?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each inhaler comes with its own directions. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use yours. In general, to use a soft mist inhaler, you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the inhaler upright with 1 hand, with the cap closed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use your other hand to turn the clear base to the right until it clicks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open the cap.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathe out slowly and completely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put the mouthpiece in your mouth, holding the inhaler horizontally. This means it should be pointing toward the back of your throat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close your lips around the mouthpiece, making sure not to cover the air vents (holes) on the sides.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a slow deep breath in. As you start to inhale, press the button on the side of the inhaler.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When your lungs are full, hold your breath for 10 seconds to keep the medicine in your lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the inhaler out of your mouth and breathe out slowly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put the cap back on the mouthpiece.</p><p/><p>You do not need to shake your inhaler. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H650411088\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to clean my inhaler?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You should clean your inhaler once a week. You can do this by wiping the inside and outside of the mouthpiece with a clean, damp cloth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387851011\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know when my inhaler is empty?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soft mist inhalers come with a built-in dose counter. A counter keeps track of how many doses are left in your inhaler.</p><p>When the counter reads 0 (zero), it's time to throw out the inhaler because it has no more medicine in it. Make sure to have another inhaler on hand before the counter reads 0.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H800259551\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-metered-dose-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your metered dose inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-dry-powder-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your dry powder inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
