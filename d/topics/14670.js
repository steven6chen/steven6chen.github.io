It is characterized by progressive immune abnormalities ranging from severe to nonsevere combined immunodeficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64286\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64286 \">table 1</a>) and neurologic symptomatology that includes ataxia, developmental delay, and spasticity. Autoimmunity, especially autoimmune hemolytic anemia, is also frequently present.</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of PNP deficiency. The related immunodeficiency, adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenosine deaminase deficiency: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenosine deaminase deficiency: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PNP deficiency constitutes approximately 1 to 2 percent of all combined immunodeficiencies. A literature review in 2011 found 67 patients from 49 families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and an update at the end of 2014 reported that there were close to 80 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/1,5-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-13</a>] &#160; Subsequently, few additional patients have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PNP deficiency is caused by mutations in the <em>PNP</em> gene (MIM #164050) at 14q13.1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77023\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77023 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/9-13,16-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13,16-23</a>]. This gene encodes the protein PNP, one of the ubiquitous enzymes involved in the purine salvage pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deaminates adenosine to yield inosine, which is then converted to hypoxanthine by PNP. PNP also converts guanosine to guanine.</p><p>A number of metabolites are elevated in the plasma and urine in PNP deficiency, including deoxyguanosine and deoxyinosine. There is an intracellular accumulation of their deoxy triphosphate compounds, particularly deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP). The latter is toxic to T cells, a property similar to deoxyadenosine triphosphate in ADA deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-deaminase-deficiency-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adenosine deaminase deficiency: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is unclear why B cells are often spared (or less severely affected) in PNP deficiency. This may be due to the selective toxicity and variability in intracellular accumulation of dGTP in different tissues. Thymocytes, because of their high apoptotic rate, generate markedly increased levels of dGTP in the thymic milieu, which may account for the predominant destruction of these cells.</p><p>PNP-deficient mice exhibit impaired thymocyte differentiation, as well as a decreased number of maturing thymocytes, particularly double-positive cells, and peripheral T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. The mitogenic and allogeneic response of T cells in these mice is decreased, T cell apoptosis is increased in vivo, and a higher sensitivity to irradiation is seen in vitro. An age-dependent attrition of thymocytes and impaired thymocyte differentiation is also seen in these mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. From this mouse model, it was postulated that there is an inhibition of mitochondrial DNA repair due to the accumulation of dGTP in mitochondria. Similar findings were observed in a patient with PNP deficiency and dysplastic marrow morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. This patient's marrow stroma and lymphocytes showed a hypersensitivity to irradiation similar to that observed in PNP-deficient mice.</p><p>PNP-deficient mice exhibit neurologic abnormalities reminiscent of those observed among patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. PNP-deficient mice were also found to have smaller than normal cerebellum with increased numbers of apoptotic Purkinje cells. However, the relevance of these findings to the human disease is still not clear, and the exact mechanisms leading to the neurologic symptoms seen in PNP deficiency are unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with PNP deficiency are symptomatic, although the onset of symptoms may be delayed for years, with age at presentation ranging from four months to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The clinical variability may depend, in part, upon whether the causative mutation(s) allow a degree residual protein expression and function. However, clear genotype-phenotype correlation has not been established. Severe cases may be detectable by newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) using the T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) assay, which is now widely used to identify neonatal T cell lymphopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening-for-primary-immunodeficiencies#H114056766\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening for primary immunodeficiencies&quot;, section on 'Screening for SCID and other T cell defects'</a>.)</p><p>Patients typically present with frequent bacterial, viral, and opportunistic infections. Sinopulmonary infections are most common, but patients may also have liver abscesses and lymphadenitis. Patients are particularly prone to disseminated varicella and progressive vaccinia. Pulmonary tuberculosis due to disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) infection after vaccination and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy due to polyomavirus JC (JC virus) infection have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/9,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,32</a>].</p><p>Failure to thrive is reported in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. The tonsillar tissues are often absent, and lymph nodes are not palpable. Some patients have splenomegaly.</p><p>Approximately two-thirds of the patients also present with progressive neurologic symptoms, including developmental delay, muscle spasticity, ataxia, and disequilibrium syndrome with pyramidal signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/6,22,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,22,33-35</a>]. Ataxia can be the initial presenting symptom.</p><p>There is an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These include hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus, cerebral vasculitis, and sclerosing cholangitis.</p><p>Certain malignancies, particularly lymphoma, are seen more frequently in patients with PNP deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PNP activity is &lt;5 percent of normal to absent in erythrocytes, leukocytes, and fibroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/7,8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,22</a>]. If the patient recently received red blood cell transfusions, measurement of PNP activity should be delayed by three to four months, or it should be performed in leukocytes separated from the patient's blood. Carriers have approximately half-normal levels of PNP. Decreased plasma levels of uric acid are also characteristic.</p><p>There is often a marked lymphopenia with low T cells (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ cells). CD19+ B cell numbers are typically normal, although patients with low or absent B cells have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The delayed-type hypersensitivity response is absent to a variety of antigens, such as <em>Candida</em>, tetanus, mumps, and trichophyton. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to various mitogens and antigens may be initially normal but decrease and become abnormal over time. Serum immunoglobulins are usually normal or elevated with normal specific antibody titers, although occasionally they are low to absent.</p><p>Dysplastic marrow was noted in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and a few patients have displayed neutropenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of PNP deficiency should be suspected in patients suffering from a wide range of immune abnormalities. These include infants undergoing assessment for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), toddlers evaluated for increased susceptibility to viral infections, or teenagers and adults with possible common variable immune deficiency (CVID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The possibility of PNP deficiency should also be entertained among the causes for autoimmune manifestations, particularly hematologic cytopenias, because of the high frequency of immune dysregulation. Additionally, PNP deficiency should be considered among infants and children with progressive neurologic deficits, such as spasticity or ataxia. The association of increased susceptibility to infections and lymphopenia together with neurologic abnormalities is an important clue. Primary immunodeficiency diseases associated with neurologic manifestations including DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, and DNA ligase IV deficiency should be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Initial screening studies in such patients should include T cell enumeration, evaluation of T cell function (proliferative response to mitogens and antigens), and serum uric acid, as well as tests to exclude alternative diagnoses. Low uric acid (&lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> with an associated T cell deficiency is suggestive of PNP deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] and should be followed by measurement of PNP enzyme activity or <em>PNP</em> gene sequencing. Few laboratories perform PNP activity measurements, while many commercial vendors offer gene sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Prenatal diagnosis is available if the condition has been diagnosed in a relative.</p><p>T cell excision circle (TREC) newborn screening may identify severe cases but not late-onset patients. Tandem mass spectrometry (TMS) can be set up to detect elevated levels of purine nucleosides and 2'-deoxy-nucleosides in dried blood spots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1716397463\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for PNP deficiency is broad, with immunologic abnormalities ranging from other forms of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) to agammaglobulinemia and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). The age at presentation can help direct the differential (SCID in a newborn, CVID in an older child or adult). The combination of immunologic and neurologic abnormalities narrows the differential further and includes DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency, and DNA ligase IV deficiency. Certain clinical and laboratory features may help differentiate these disorders from PNP deficiency, and the diagnosis can then be confirmed by PNP enzymatic activity, genetic testing, or both.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DiGeorge syndrome</strong> &ndash; DGS is a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with defective development of the pharyngeal pouch system. Thymic hypoplasia in DGS results in a range of T cell deficits, from mild defects that do not result in clinical immunodeficiency to a form of SCID called complete DGS, similar to the wide range of immunodeficiency seen with PNP deficiency. In addition, both DGS and PNP deficiency can result in cognitive impairment or tonus abnormalities. However, the classic triad of features of DGS on presentation (conotruncal cardiac anomalies, hypoplastic thymus, and hypocalcemia resulting from parathyroid hypoplasia) are not seen in PNP deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ataxia-telangiectasia</strong> &ndash; Children with AT suffer from progressive cerebellar ataxia, abnormal eye movements, other neurologic abnormalities, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, and a combined immunodeficiency with recurrent sinopulmonary infections. Associated features include pulmonary disease, an increased incidence of malignancy, radiation sensitivity, growth retardation, and diabetes mellitus caused by insulin resistance. AT is best differentiated from PNP deficiency by genetic testing since oculocutaneous telangiectasias do not appear until three to five years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ataxia-telangiectasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ataxia-telangiectasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adenosine deaminase deficiency</strong> &ndash; ADA deficiency typically leads to a SCID with dysfunction of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells (T-B-NK- SCID) that presents in the first few months of life. However, there are also a few patients with a later onset and relatively milder disease. Neurologic abnormalities are prominent in ADA deficiency and include cognitive deficits, behavioral problems, gait abnormalities, hypo- and hypertonia, and sensorineural hearing loss. Unlike PNP deficiency, B cells are typically low to absent. Blood and urine testing for metabolic abnormalities can also help differentiate between ADA and PNP deficiencies.

Unlike PNP deficiency, B cells are typically low to absent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-b-nk-scid-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T-B-NK+ SCID: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PNP deficiency benefit from supportive care, including <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis, immunoglobulin replacement when abnormal antibody production is evident, and avoidance of live viral and Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccines. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative option offered to PNP-deficient patients. However, detailed information on such procedures has been reported for fewer than 20 patients. The paucity of data limits accurate assessment of the potential immune and neurologic benefits from HCT in patients with PNP deficiency, as well as clear guidance on the best conditioning regimen. Nevertheless, the success of HCT in PNP deficiency should prompt discussion of such curative procedures in all patients.</p><p>The majority of patients received HCT from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched or one-antigen-mismatched family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/15,34,35,43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,34,35,43-46</a>]. Two patients received HCT without conditioning because of disseminated herpes virus or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/15,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,43</a>]. Follow-up of these patients demonstrated greater than 90 percent engraftment of donor T cells. Few PNP-deficient patients received HCT from HLA haploidentical family donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/6,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,47</a>]. Survival was poor, with only one of six patients achieving long-term engraftment and survival. HCT with unrelated donors who are HLA matched, or closely matched, has been used with increasing frequency for PNP deficiency.</p><p>Graft failure occurred in a patient who received an HLA-matched, unrelated-donor transplant following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> conditioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Repeat transplant using the same donor with fludarabine, treosulfan, and alemtuzumab conditioning resulted in mixed, yet stable, T cell lineage chimerism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Similarly, fludarabine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, and alemtuzumab conditioning prior to HCT with bone marrow from a <span class=\"nowrap\">9/10</span> HLA loci identical unrelated donor led to normal lymphocyte counts and subsets 21 months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Reduced-intensity conditioning consisting of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>, and antithymocyte globulins followed by transplant with peripheral blood CD34+ cells from an HLA-matched unrelated donor led to complete engraftment of donor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Two patients received umbilical cord blood cells from unrelated donors. One patient died three months after an HLA-matched unrelated cord blood transplant that was performed after the patient failed a previous haploidentical transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The second patient achieved full donor chimerism and improved T lineage counts and function following an umbilical cord blood transplant with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and antithymocyte globulins conditioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>HCT should be performed when patients are young and preferably prior to development of irreversible damage from infections. However, success has also been reported when HCT was performed in the second decade of in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In addition to reversal of the immune deficiency, HCT may benefit the neurologic abnormalities seen associated with PNP deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The neurologic status may improve in some patients following successful transplantations, possibly because of better clinical status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/35,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,44</a>], while, in other patients, further neurologic deterioration and developmental delay may be halted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Frequent transfusions of red blood cells, which are rich in PNP, have been shown to improve metabolic and immune function in patients with PNP deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, the benefits are only transient, and complications from the transfusions have limited long-term use of this treatment. Studies in PNP-deficient mice also indicate that correction of purine metabolism early in life can prevent the development of neurologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These findings have prompted the use of red blood cell exchange transfusions in infants diagnosed with PNP deficiency at birth as a temporizing measure until HCT could be performed.</p><p>Gene therapy for PNP deficiency is under investigation. Preliminary in vitro human studies and in vivo murine studies using a lentiviral vector demonstrated increased PNP expression and partial correction of some of the abnormalities associated with PNP deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/purine-nucleoside-phosphorylase-deficiency/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].
