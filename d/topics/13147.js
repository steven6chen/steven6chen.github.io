The likely molecular cascade of events by which pain sensitive trigeminal afferent neurons are activated by cortical spreading depression involves the opening of neuronal pannexin-1 megachannels and subsequent activation of caspase-1, followed by the release of the proinflammatory mediators, activation of nuclear factor kappa-B in astrocytes, and transduction of the inflammatory signal to trigeminal nerve fibers around pial vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, this pathway links cortical spreading depression, the phenomenon thought to underlie the migraine aura, to prolonged activation of trigeminal nociception, which generates the pain of the migraine headache.</p><p>It has been suggested that migraine without aura may be caused by the occurrence of cortical spreading depression in areas of the brain (eg, cerebellum) where depolarization is not consciously perceived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130649641\"><span class=\"h2\">Trigeminovascular system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of migraine involves activation of the trigeminovascular system, which consists of small caliber pseudounipolar sensory neurons that originate from the trigeminal ganglion and upper cervical dorsal roots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These sensory neurons project to innervate large cerebral vessels, pial vessels, dura mater, and large venous sinuses. Most of the innervation of the anterior structures is via the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve with a greater contribution of upper cervical roots to posterior structures.</p><p>There is convergence of the projections from the upper cervical nerve roots and the trigeminal nerve at the trigeminal nucleus caudalis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This convergence can explain the distribution of migraine pain, which often includes anterior and posterior regions of the head and the upper neck. Once transmitted to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis by trigeminal axons, central signals can be modulated by projections from the rostral trigeminal nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], the periaqueductal gray, and the nucleus raphe magnus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] as well as by descending cortical inhibitory systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>From the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, fibers that are involved in the localization of pain ascend to the thalamus (mostly to the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus) and to the sensory cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other second-order neurons from the trigeminal nucleus caudalis project to numerous subcortical sites including the more rostral segments of the trigeminal complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], the reticular formation of the brain stem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], the cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], the midbrain and pontine parabrachial nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], the ventrobasal thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/21,24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24,27,28</a>], the posterior thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], and the medial thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. From more rostral brain stem nuclei, nociceptive information is transmitted to other brain areas (eg, limbic regions) involved in the emotional and vegetative responses to pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion results in release of vasoactive neuropeptides, including substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and neurokinin A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Release of these neuropeptides is associated with the process of neurogenic inflammation. The two main components of this sterile inflammatory response are vasodilation (calcitonin gene-related peptide is a potent vasodilator) and plasma protein extravasation.</p><p>Neurogenic inflammation is thought to be important in the prolongation and intensification of the pain of migraine. Elevated levels of vasoactive neuropeptides have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with chronic migraine, suggesting chronic activation of the trigeminovascular system in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Peripheral sensitization in the primary afferent neurons and central sensitization within second order neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and higher order neurons in the central nervous system are thought to play a role within individual migraine attacks and, perhaps, even in the transformation of episodic migraine to chronic migraine.</p><p>Sensitization is likely responsible for many of the clinical symptoms of migraine, including the throbbing quality of the pain, the worsening of pain with coughing, bending, or sudden head movements (as is often observed during the postdrome), hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to painful stimuli), and allodynia (pain produced by normally non-noxious stimulation).</p><p>Functional brain imaging has identified abnormalities in the ascending and descending pain pathways of patients with migraine during and in between attacks. Alterations in blood flow to the dorsal pons, anterior cingulate cortex, visual cortex, and auditory association cortex have been seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Patients with chronic migraine are found to have altered blood flow to the dorsal pons, anterior cingulate cortex, and cuneus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Structural changes in the brain have also been found. Studies suggest that patients with migraine have increased cortical thickness in motion-processing visual areas, increased density of the periaqueductal gray and dorsolateral pons, and decreased gray matter in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Increased iron levels have been identified in the periaqueductal gray of episodic and chronic migraineurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130649648\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of serotonin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although activation at serotonin receptors is of known importance in the acute treatment of migraine, its role in the generation of migraine is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Some authors have suggested that serotonin (released from brainstem serotonergic nuclei) plays a role in the pathogenesis of migraine, perhaps mediated by its direct action upon the cranial vasculature, by its role in central pain control pathways, or by cerebral cortical projections of brainstem serotonergic nuclei [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Such a role for serotonin is supported by the fact that tricyclic antidepressants, which block serotonin reuptake, are effective antimigraine prophylactic agents. In contrast, however, more selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not very effective in migraine prevention. There is other evidence that a low serotonin state may result in a deficit in the serotonin descending pain inhibitory system, facilitating activation of the trigeminovascular nociceptive pathways in conjunction with cortical spreading depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130649655\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of calcitonin gene-related peptide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) may also play a role in migraine pathophysiology. CGRP is a 37 amino acid neuropeptide that is expressed in trigeminal ganglia nerves and is a potent vasodilator of cerebral and dural vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>CGRP may mediate trigeminovascular pain transmission from intracranial vessels to the central nervous system, as well as the vasodilatory component of neurogenic inflammation. However, the evidence is conflicting. Stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion induces the release of CGRP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and CGRP infusion can trigger a migraine attack in migraineurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In healthy subjects without migraine, a placebo-controlled crossover trial found that exogenous CGRP infusion causes vasodilation of the middle meningeal artery (extracranial) but not the middle cerebral artery (intracranial), whereas <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a> infusion causes vasoconstriction of the middle meningeal artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The lack of vasodilatory response of the intracranial artery to CGRP infusion in this trial may be explained by the inability of exogenous CGRP to cross the blood-brain-barrier. Although one study found elevation of CGRP levels in external jugular venous blood during migraine attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], this result was not reproduced in a subsequent study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Furthermore, CGRP did not activate or sensitize meningeal nociceptors in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Elevated CGRP levels are normalized in patients with migraine following administration of the serotonin <span class=\"nowrap\">1b/1d</span> receptor agonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], suggesting that triptans may act to control migraine at least in part by blocking the release of CGRP.</p><p>Pharmacologic modulation of CGRP activity offers the promise of future treatment options for acute migraine attacks. This is discussed separately.

As with most common diseases, the genetic basis of migraine is likely to be complex and in some individuals may be based on the additive effect of more than one genetic source. Individuals prone to migraine have a genetic threshold that renders them susceptible to an acute migraine attack depending upon the balance between excitation and inhibition at various levels of the nervous system. Subtle abnormalities, involving membrane channels, receptor families, and enzyme systems have been linked to migraine in certain groups and individuals.</p><p>The importance of inheritance in migraine has long been recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. One early general population based study found that the risk of migraine in relatives of migraineurs was three times greater than that of relatives of non-migraine control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However segregation analysis does not identify any single Mendelian pattern of inheritance in the common forms of migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Large national registry-based twin studies have confirmed a consistently higher concordance of migraine in monozygotic twins versus dizygotic twins. In one such study, using a polygenic multifactorial model, researchers estimated that inheritance accounts for 40 to 50 percent of an individual's susceptibility to migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130650973\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics of the common forms of migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic basis of the common forms of migraine (migraine with aura and migraine without aura) has not been clarified despite increasing research. A number of candidate genes have been linked with migraine, a list that includes the KCNK18 gene that encodes for TRESK, a two-pore domain potassium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], and the CSNK1D gene, which encodes casein kinase I isoform delta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. However, the findings of gene studies in migraine generally have not been replicated in subsequent reports. As an example, a systematic re-evaluation of 27 promising candidate migraine genes in a large data set compiled from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), with over 5175 patients with migraine and 13,972 control subjects, found that none of the candidate genes reached the threshold for statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Thus, it is still uncertain which candidate loci and genes are truly implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine.</p><p>The common forms of migraine are likely to be complex genetic disorders, meaning that multiple genes at different genomic sites act in tandem with environmental factors to confer both the susceptibility to and the characteristics of the disease in affected individuals. One possible explanation for the lack of replication in genetic studies of migraine is that a few gene polymorphisms are frequently tested for association in relatively small populations in which only a portion of the subjects have migraine that arises from the studied variant, while the migraine in other case subjects has a different basis. This would tend to lower the power of many of these studies to detect a significant difference in the case subjects compared with the non-migraine control subjects. The eventual identification of the genes that underlie migraine in an individual patient is extremely important, as it may be predictive of the type of prophylactic treatment to which the patient will respond.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130650654\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial hemiplegic migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemiplegic migraine may occur either in families or only in one individual (sporadic). The first three types of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) are channelopathies. FHM1 is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene, FHM2 by mutations in the ATP1A2 gene, and FHM3 by mutations in the SCN1A gene. Mutations in the PRRT2 gene also cause some cases of familial hemiplegic migraine. The known types of familial hemiplegic migraine account for only a small proportion of cases.

Traditional teaching is that migraine aura usually precedes the headache. However, prospective data suggest that most patients with migraine experience headache during the aura phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Typical migraine auras are characterized by gradual development, duration no longer than one hour, a mix of positive and negative features, and complete reversibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Positive symptoms indicate active discharge from central nervous system neurons. Typical positive symptoms can be visual (eg, bright lines, shapes, objects), auditory (eg, tinnitus, noises, music), somatosensory (eg, burning, pain, paresthesia), or motor (eg, jerking or repetitive rhythmic movements). Negative symptoms indicate an absence or loss of function, such as loss of vision, hearing, feeling, or ability to move a part of the body. Auras are most often visual, but can also be sensory, verbal, or motor disturbances.</p><p>The aura of migraine usually develops gradually over more than five minutes. Less often, the aura develops more acutely (ie, in less than five minutes). The acute onset of aura makes confusion with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke more likely. In one case series, four patients (2 percent) had exclusively acute onset visual aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2109237351\"><span class=\"h3\">Visual aura</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A visual aura classically begins as a small area of visual loss often just lateral to the point of visual fixation. It may either appear as a bright spot or as an area of visual loss. Over the following five minutes to one hour, the visual disturbance expands to involve a quadrant or hemifield of vision. Along the expanding margin geometric shapes or zigzagging lines often appear. The shapes account for one of the common names for aura, the &quot;fortification spectrum,&quot; because of the resemblance of the aura to the walls of a medieval fortress. The positive visual phenomena may assume a sickle or C-shape, expanding over time toward the peripheral visual field, leaving a scotoma or area of complete visual loss in their wake. As the aura moves off into the peripheral visual field, it often assumes a shimmering or scintillating quality. As the aura resolves, vision usually returns first to the areas of central vision initially affected by the aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

A sensory aura usually begins as a tingling in one limb or on one side of the face. As the tingling sensation migrates across one side of the face or down the limb, numbness is left in its wake that may last up to an hour. The sensory aura may also move inside the mouth, affecting the buccal mucosa and half the tongue. The slow spread of positive symptoms (scintillations or tingling) followed by negative symptoms (scotoma or numbness) is quite characteristic of migraine aura and is not typical for an ischemic event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1718091796\"><span class=\"h3\">Language aura</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less common than the visual and sensory auras is the language or dysphasic aura.

Migraine with brainstem aura was previously called basilar-type migraine. It occurs more often in females than in males. Onset is usually between ages 7 to 20. The auras consist of some combination of vertigo, dysarthria, tinnitus, diplopia, ataxia, decreased level of consciousness, and hypacusis. Attacks nearly always include two or more brainstem-related aura symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73674\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73674 \">table 1</a>). Attacks may evolve to more typical common forms of migraine with age.</p><p>The occurrence of decreased level of consciousness followed by headache sometimes results in diagnostic difficulty. It is important to remember that migraine with brainstem aura is rare and that there must be another brainstem symptom in addition to decreased consciousness to make the diagnosis. In the absence of a second brainstem localizing symptom, other causes of unexplained loss of consciousness such as seizure and cardiogenic syncope must be considered and appropriately investigated. Migraine with brainstem aura should be diagnosed only when weakness is absent, since a number of patients with familial hemiplegic migraine have brainstem symptoms.

Activation of the trigeminovascular system plays a central role in the pathophysiology of migraine, including the onset of neurogenic inflammation which is linked to the pain of migraine. Sensitization, a process in which neurons become increasingly responsive to nociceptive and non-nociceptive stimulation, is likely responsible for many of the clinical symptoms of migraine. (See <a href=\"#H130649620\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The genetic basis of the common forms of migraine is likely complex and in some individuals may be based on the additive effect of more than one genetic source. The KCNK18 and CSNK1D genes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine with aura. Familial hemiplegic migraine is associated with mutations in four genes, three of which encode for transmembrane ion channels. (See <a href=\"#H130650647\" class=\"local\">'Genetic basis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine is a common condition that affects up to 12 percent of the general population. It is more frequent in women than in men. (See <a href=\"#H21674074\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Migraine is a disorder of recurrent attacks. The attacks unfold through a cascade of events that occur over the course of several hours to days. A typical migraine attack progresses through four phases: the prodrome, the aura, the headache, and the postdrome. (See <a href=\"#H21674085\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The prodrome consists of affective or vegetative symptoms that appear 24 to 48 hours prior to the onset of headache. (See <a href=\"#H203275048\" class=\"local\">'Migraine prodrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>About 25 percent of people with migraines experience one or more focal neurologic symptoms in the second phase, called the migraine aura. Auras are most often visual, but can also be sensory, verbal, or motor disturbances. (See <a href=\"#H203275055\" class=\"local\">'Migraine aura'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The headache of migraine is often but not always unilateral and tends to have a throbbing or pulsatile quality. Accompanying features may include nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia during attacks. (See <a href=\"#H203275062\" class=\"local\">'Migraine headache'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Migraine trigger factors may include stress, menstruation, visual stimuli, weather changes, nitrates, fasting, wine, sleep disturbances, and aspartame, among others. (See <a href=\"#H21674092\" class=\"local\">'Precipitating and exacerbating factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subtypes of migraine include migraine with brainstem aura, hemiplegic migraine, retinal migraine, vestibular migraine, menstrual migraine, and chronic migraine. Complications of migraine are characterized by prolonged symptoms or, rarely, with infarction or seizures (ie, status migrainosus, persistent aura without infarction, migrainous infarction, and migraine aura-triggered seizure). Ophthalmoplegic &quot;migraine&quot; is now considered a cranial neuralgia called recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy. (See <a href=\"#H222097293\" class=\"local\">'Migraine subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of migraine is a clinical task and is based upon a compatible history, physical examination, and fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50876 \">table 3</a>). Neuroimaging is not necessary in most patients.
