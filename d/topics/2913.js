For the purpose of this topic, the following definitions apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chest pain with normal coronary arteries (CPNA)</strong> is the broadest term and is used to refer to anyone with angina-like chest pain and normal epicardial coronary arteries on coronary angiography. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microvascular angina</strong> is applied to any patient with angina (or evidence of myocardial ischemia) who is shown to have evidence of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMVD). The term was originally used to define patients with angina despite normal coronary arteries in whom the mechanism was microvascular dysfunction. Currently, the term &quot;microvascular angina&quot; is broadly encompassing and includes any category of patients in whom CMVD contributes to the development of myocardial ischemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac syndrome X</strong> refers to patients with angina-like symptoms, abnormalities on stress testing performed with or without perfusion studies, and normal epicardial coronary arteries on coronary angiography. These patients often have one or more abnormal tests of the coronary microcirculation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with diagnoses such as diabetes mellitus may have disease of the microcirculation, but are not given a diagnosis of cardiac syndrome X, nor are patients with organic heart disease such as left ventricular hypertrophy or amyloidosis. These patients may or may not have angina.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262633435\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of cardiac syndrome X is uncertain. Two mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive have been proposed: myocardial ischemia that might be caused by coronary microvascular dysfunction (ie, abnormal dilatory responses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased vasoconstriction); and enhanced sensitivity to intracardiac pain or the so-called &quot;sensitive heart&quot; syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-syndrome-x-angina-pectoris-with-normal-coronary-arteries/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H262635593\"><span class=\"h2\">Ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting data concerning the role of myocardial ischemia in cardiac syndrome X. In part, some of this uncertainty is due to a lack of techniques that can adequately visualize the microvasculature. Exercise-induced perfusion defects or wall motion abnormalities have been seen in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-syndrome-x-angina-pectoris-with-normal-coronary-arteries/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-syndrome-x-angina-pectoris-with-normal-coronary-arteries/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>] studies in response to stress with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> or transesophageal atrial pacing. It is possible that ischemia in cardiac syndrome X is limited to the subendocardium, which might explain the inconsistent evidence of perfusion defects and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-syndrome-x-angina-pectoris-with-normal-coronary-arteries/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>], but not all studies have been conclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-syndrome-x-angina-pectoris-with-normal-coronary-arteries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. If ischemia is an important cause of chest pain in cardiac syndrome X, at least three mechanisms may contribute: endothelial cell dysfunction; abnormal cardiac adrenergic tone; and, in some cases, occult small vessel coronary artery disease.</p><p>The cardiac microvasculature in patients with cardiac syndrome X may have a reduced vasodilator, or even a paradoxical vasoconstrictor, response to several pharmacologic agents (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> and acetylcholine) and exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-syndrome-x-angina-pectoris-with-normal-coronary-arteries/abstract/3,5,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,12-14</a>]. This coronary microvascular dysfunction may be part of a more generalized vascular disorder, since it is often associated with endothelial dysfunction of the peripheral conduit arteries and smooth muscle cell dysfunction in other organs such as the bronchi and the cerebral microcirculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-syndrome-x-angina-pectoris-with-normal-coronary-arteries/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>].

The quality of the chest pain is similar to classical angina pectoris associated with obstructive coronary artery disease. Patients with cardiac syndrome X report that their episodes are predominantly exertional, and that many occur from midnight to early morning. Each episode of chest pain generally lasts 5 to 15 minutes.

The diagnosis is given when there is documentation of abnormal coronary microvascular response to functional testing with the reproduction of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with cardiac syndrome X and stable symptoms have an excellent prognosis. It is important to communicate this information to patients. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with evidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease not responsible for angina or those at high risk, should receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and statin. Atherosclerotic risk factors should be modified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with cardiac syndrome X who have unacceptable angina after treatment with sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>, risk factor modification when appropriate, and reassurance, we suggest initial treatment with a beta blocker rather than other therapies for angina (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We start with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> 50 mg daily. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom the pathogenetic mechanism is known to be primarily vasoconstriction, as determined by testing with pharmacologic agents, it is reasonable to start with a calcium channel blocker.
