For patients with a variety of advanced illnesses, palliative care is applicable early in the course of the disease in conjunction with disease-modifying therapies (the simultaneous care model); it is not limited to end of life care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

With the introduction of tolerable, effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV infection was transformed from a terminal disease with a uniformly poor prognosis to a serious chronic illness, at least in resource-rich settings among individuals who know their HIV status and are adherent to ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

These patients have a substantial burden of medical and psychiatric comorbidities, pain, and other symptoms throughout the course of the disease, and a wide-ranging need for psychosocial, family, and care-planning support. Although no studies have investigated this to date, it is possible that treatment of these comorbidities could improve HIV outcomes, such as adherence to ART, retention in HIV primary care, and virologic suppression.</p><p>This topic review describes an approach to palliative care in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/acquired</span> immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in resource-rich settings that is based on the available literature and our clinical experience. The specific areas in which palliative care principles and expertise might assist in the care of individuals with HIV infection include establishing goals of care, advance care planning, making decisions about continuing or discontinuing ART as the end of life approaches, and symptom management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183641179\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF HIV STAGES AND TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV infection can be divided into the following stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral transmission (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The natural history and clinical features of HIV infection in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Viral transmission'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute HIV infection (also called primary HIV infection or acute seroconversion syndrome) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The natural history and clinical features of HIV infection in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Acute and early HIV infection'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic HIV infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The natural history and clinical features of HIV infection in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Chronic HIV infection, without AIDS'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The natural history and clinical features of HIV infection in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'AIDS and advanced HIV infection'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Asymptomatic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early symptomatic HIV infection (previously known as AIDS-related complex [ARC] or Class B)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>AIDS characterized by a CD4 cell count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or the presence of any AIDS-defining condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59724\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59724 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Advanced or late HIV infection characterized by a CD4 cell count &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span></p><p/><p>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for all HIV infected individuals.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HIV treatment has changed dramatically since the early 1990s. Modern ART generally consists of two or more drugs of different classes in combination to prevent the acquisition of drug resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60927 \">table 3</a>). Many combinations are available in a single pill, which decreases the pill burden. Adherence is important because nonadherence can lead to viral replication in the presence of ineffective levels of one or more of the drugs used in the regimen, causing the virus to mutate and reducing susceptibility to current drugs used to treat HIV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antiretroviral-agents-used-to-treat-hiv\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antiretroviral agents used to treat HIV&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is administered to certain HIV infected patients with the goal of preventing a clinically significant opportunistic infection. Such treatment is typically initiated as the individual&rsquo;s cell-mediated immunity (ie, CD4 cell count) declines. For certain infections, the decision to initiate antimicrobial therapy also depends upon prior exposure to the pathogen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-prevention-of-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of prevention of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1748916394\"><span class=\"h1\">BURDEN OF HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HIV epidemic has reached every country and nearly all populations throughout the world. Globally, an estimated 37 million individuals are HIV infected, with just over 1 million of those in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=global-epidemiology-of-hiv-infection#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Global epidemiology of HIV infection&quot;, section on 'Worldwide statistics'</a>.)</p><p>Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) have resulted in significant changes in the survival rate and quality of life of HIV infected individuals over the past 20 to 25 years. In resource-rich settings, HIV infected adults who are aware of their diagnosis, are linked to and stay in ongoing care, adhere to ART treatment, and are virologically suppressed have expected life spans approaching that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. This increase in life expectancy is attributable to the decreased incidence of opportunistic infections (OIs) because of early initiation of ART and improved care for those with HIV-related complications, which has led to an increase in five-year survival after an AIDS-defining OI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3607670653\" class=\"local\">'Prognostication and the influence of ART'</a> below.)</p><p>However, this dramatically increased life expectancy has also contributed to a rapidly aging HIV infected population. A Dutch modeling study projected that the percentage of individuals with HIV over age 50 would increase from an already sizable 28 percent of the population in 2010 to 73 percent by 2030 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Additionally, individuals of all ages with HIV are at risk for premature age-related comorbidities, as compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Therefore, despite gains in life expectancy, individuals with HIV shoulder a large burden of morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H2679921239\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidity and multimorbidity'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection in older adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Furthermore, despite advances in ART, complications of end-stage HIV disease are still prevalent because of undiagnosed cases and difficulties with adherence to ART <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with retention in care. Roughly one-third of individuals living with HIV in the United States are diagnosed late in the disease course, at a time when they already have a CD4 count below 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or an AIDS-defining illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Risk factors associated with these challenges include substance abuse (alcohol, intravenous drug use), depression, the stigma of HIV infection, lack of social support, and younger age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. The challenges inherent in managing these patients are discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H2369327761\" class=\"local\">'Challenges in caring for patients with advanced HIV/AIDS'</a> below.)</p><p>Challenges also remain in resource-limited countries. Despite advances in ART provision in such settings, a large proportion of HIV infected patients still do not have access to or are otherwise not receiving ART.

Multimorbidity, which is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as two or more chronic health conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], is an evolving concept in HIV disease. Multimorbidity is sometimes referred to as polypathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Compared with matched controls in the general population, individuals with HIV infection have higher rates of age-related comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, cardiovascular disease, and fractures, which occur an average of 10 years earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other common comorbidities include osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], frailty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and neurocognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These comorbid conditions are thought to be related to a myriad of factors, including direct toxicity from the virus, chronic inflammation, chronic immunosuppression, toxicity related to ART, and elevated rates of high-risk health behaviors in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/29,32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32-36</a>]. HIV-specific risk factors for developing comorbidities include lower nadir CD4 cell count and prolonged ART exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult#H45\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary care of the HIV-infected adult&quot;, section on 'Monitoring for complications'</a>.)</p><p>Notably, these medical comorbidities are in addition to the relatively high rates of psychiatric illness and substance use disorders in individuals with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].

Since many patients with advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> have not yet begun ART or have had past challenges with adherence or retention, the likelihood of long-term success of treatment of the acute condition in these patients is often uncertain. In our view, in the current treatment era, any attempt at prognostication that does not address whether the patient has had an adequate trial of ART would be ill-informed and inaccurate.</p><p>Some important prognostic indices for individuals with HIV have been developed from contemporary observational cohorts. These indices incorporate combinations of HIV-specific and non-HIV-specific biologic, behavioral, and demographic variables and offer prognostic information about risk and survival. For example, one of the most widely cited indices, the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS) index, combines seven variables to predict mortality in HIV infected individuals: age, CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, hemoglobin, Fibrosis-4 Index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], presence of hepatitis C, and glomerular filtration rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. </p><p>However, such indices neglect a critical factor in individuals with AIDS who are not on ART: ART can have a determinative impact on long-term survival. This is true even when patients present with advanced AIDS-related conditions that meet criteria for hospice admission, such as central nervous system toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2005553683\" class=\"local\">'Hospice'</a> below.)</p><p>In the current treatment era of potent ART, resistance to treatment leading to inability to find a fully active regimen is uncommon. Therefore, when individuals with HIV infection in resource-rich settings are dying of AIDS or AIDS-related illnesses, the root cause is typically a breakdown in what is known as the HIV treatment cascade. These patients are not taking ART because they are either unaware they have HIV and have been diagnosed with advanced disease, know they have HIV but are not linked to HIV care, or are linked to care but are not adherent to ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171303055\"><span class=\"h2\">ART management in advanced disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the uncertainties with prognosis in the patient with advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS,</span> which depends substantially on the success of ART, we recommend the following general approach to ART management in individuals with advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS:</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals without an AIDS-defining illness who are not on ART due to late diagnosis or challenges with adherence or retention, every attempt should be made to fully engage them in care and begin ART, with close attention to adherence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients#H27016986\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Benefits of antiretroviral therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy&quot;, section on 'Adherence'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with an AIDS-defining illness who are not on effective ART, we strongly recommend a trial of ART. ART should be initiated in consultation with an HIV specialist; the optimal time to initiate ART varies by clinical situation (see individual topic reviews for recommendations about initiation of ART in the setting of OIs). This trial should last for at least six months. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In such patients, the short-term prognosis depends on the severity of the acute illness, particularly in cases such as cryptococcal meningitis requiring shunt placement, extensive Kaposi sarcoma, or pneumocystis pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation, which are associated with high mortality rates, even when treated aggressively. However, long-term prognosis typically depends not only on following patients through their acute medical issues, but also upon whether patients can maintain lifelong retention in HIV primary care and adherence to ART. Since many patients with AIDS-related illnesses have not yet begun ART or have had past challenges with adherence or retention, the likelihood of long-term success in these patients is often uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Determining with certainty which patients will be able to achieve long-term ART adherence, retention, and virologic suppression when they present with an AIDS-related illness is an impossible task. Therefore, it should be assumed that <strong>all</strong> individuals with HIV have the potential to achieve long-term success until clearly demonstrated otherwise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Frank conversations with patients and their families in these situations are essential. Optimistic messages about availability of effective ART regimens should be communicated alongside the realities of the severity of the patient&rsquo;s acute illness and what would be necessary in order for the patient to achieve long-term success in terms of life-long ART adherence and retention in HIV primary care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This discussion should prompt a discussion of the patient&rsquo;s goals of care. Some patients may have goals that focus on quality of life over quantity; other patients may be focused on treating the acute illness aggressively, regardless of the invasiveness of the treatments required; still others may fall somewhere in between. It is the provider&rsquo;s responsibility to respect the patient&rsquo;s choice, tailor the plan of care to the patient&rsquo;s goals, and revise the plan of care as often as necessary as these conversations evolve. A subspecialty palliative care consultation may facilitate these discussions. (See <a href=\"#H1613548218\" class=\"local\">'Advance care planning'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1317599566\" class=\"local\">'Primary versus secondary (subspecialty) palliative care'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is important that all such patients have continuity, ideally with an experienced HIV primary care provider. Therefore, if such discussions occur in an inpatient setting, they should be done in consultation with an HIV specialist. Upon discharge, that specialist should facilitate the patient&rsquo;s linkage with outpatient HIV care and clearly communicate the patient&rsquo;s treatment plan as part of this hand-off.</p><p/><p>Notably, the factors that lead to late diagnosis or that lead to suboptimal adherence to ART or retention in care include mental illness, substance use disorders, and lack of social support. These are serious comorbidities and concerns in and of themselves, and they can often continue to pose a barrier to restoring a patient&rsquo;s health. They should be addressed directly whenever possible. </p><p>In rare instances, high-level HIV drug resistance leaves a patient with no available fully active salvage regimen. Continuing a patient on a partially active regimen may control their disease enough to prolong their survival until a new drug or class of drugs is available. Occasionally, no such partially active regimen is available, and it may be appropriate to discontinue ART. This decision should be made in close consultation with an HIV specialist.</p><p>Even more rarely, there are instances in which individuals with advanced AIDS are unable to benefit from ART due to extenuating clinical circumstances. As an example, all current standard agents are only available in oral form. Therefore, gastrointestinal malabsorption, severe hypoalbuminemia, or other mechanical or functional barriers to adequate bioavailability of ART exist. Occasionally, for patients who have a functioning gastrointestinal tract but cannot ingest the medication (eg, are unable to swallow or have intractable <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting),</span> clinicians may consider time-limited percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement in order to deliver the antiretroviral effectively. However, in such cases, this must be done in concert with the patient&rsquo;s wishes about artificial feeding and, if done primarily for a trial of ART, should be managed in this time-limited context (eg, not left in place and used indefinitely if not in accord with the patient&rsquo;s intentions).</p><p>In general, once an individual is successfully on suppressive ART, they should continue it as long as it is consistent with the goals of care.

Physiologic factors associated with fatigue or fatigue severity in individuals with HIV infection include liver disease, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, anemia, and duration of HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/140-142\" class=\"abstract_t\">140-142</a>]. An association with CD4 cell count and viral load is supported by some studies but not others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/140-142\" class=\"abstract_t\">140-142</a>]. In an earlier HIV treatment era, there was an association between ART and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]; it is not clear whether this is still the case. Psychological and social factors associated with fatigue include stressful life events, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and low income [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/138,141,143\" class=\"abstract_t\">138,141,143</a>]. </p><p>Fatigue in individuals with HIV infection interferes with physical, social, and mental functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]; it may also interfere with adherence to ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/145\" class=\"abstract_t\">145</a>]. An instrument to measure the severity and impact of fatigue in individuals with HIV infection has been developed (the HIV-related fatigue scale) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H290557548\"><span class=\"h4\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In individuals with HIV infection, the approach to fatigue should be the same as in the general palliative care population. This includes a search for medical or psychiatric causes (especially hypogonadism), medication review, inquiry regarding the patient&rsquo;s sleep patterns, and treatment of the underlying cause, when present. Testosterone may help hypogonadal men with fatigue. Moderate exercise is a reasonable recommendation, if patients are able to tolerate it.

Efficacy and safety were addressed in two systematic reviews: one of progressive resistance exercise at all stages of HIV infection (seven studies, 294 participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]) and the other of aerobic exercise at all stages of HIV infection (14 studies, 454 participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]). In the first systematic review of resistance exercise, fatigue was considered as a primary outcome measure of cardiopulmonary fitness but was not reported in any of the included studies. In the second systematic review, only one of the included trials (n = 60 patients) found a significant decrease in fatigue in exercisers as compared with non-exercisers, as measured by time on the treadmill, but none of the patients were in the advanced stage of illness. Despite the paucity of data, moderate exercise is a reasonable recommendation, if patients are able to tolerate it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1974026760\"><span class=\"h3\">Anorexia and tissue wasting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, weight loss and tissue wasting were common in HIV, particularly in the later stages of the disease.

However, even in the modern treatment era, individuals with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> fit well within the &ldquo;serious illness&rdquo; paradigm for which early integration of palliative care plays a complementary role to active treatment of the underlying disease. These patients have a substantial burden of medical and psychiatric comorbidities, as well as pain and other symptoms, throughout the course of the disease, and a wide-ranging need for psychosocial, family, and care-planning support. (See <a href=\"#H3009004906\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite advances in ART, complications of end-stage HIV disease are still seen because of undiagnosed cases and difficulties with adherence to ART <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with retention in care. Furthermore, despite gains in life expectancy from ART, AIDS-defining illnesses still cause a sizable proportion of deaths among HIV infected individuals, and they shoulder a large burden of morbidity because of the premature age-related comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H1748916394\" class=\"local\">'Burden of HIV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosis and disease trajectory in individuals with advanced HIV or AIDS are highly variable and depend on many factors that are both disease related and treatment related. Since many patients with advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> have not yet begun ART or have had past challenges with adherence or retention, the likelihood of long-term success of treatment of any acute condition in these patients is often uncertain. Any attempt at prognostication that does not address whether the patient has had an adequate trial of ART is ill informed and inaccurate. (See <a href=\"#H3607670653\" class=\"local\">'Prognostication and the influence of ART'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals without an AIDS-defining illness who are not on ART, every attempt should be made to fully engage them in care and begin ART, with close attention to adherence. For individuals with an AIDS-defining illness who are not on effective ART, we strongly recommend a trial of ART in consultation with an HIV specialist. The optimal time to initiate ART varies by clinical situation. This trial should last for at least six months. (See <a href=\"#H171303055\" class=\"local\">'ART management in advanced disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life for the patient and their family through relief of emotional and physical symptoms. While primary care and infectious disease physicians caring for patients with advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> are able to manage most of their patients&rsquo; palliative care issues, clinicians who are specifically trained in palliative care can provide more in-depth pain and symptom management, communication regarding goals of care, and care coordination across settings and over time. (See <a href=\"#H1317599566\" class=\"local\">'Primary versus secondary (subspecialty) palliative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important components of a comprehensive palliative care assessment include exploring the patient&rsquo;s understanding about their illness and prognosis; assessing and managing symptoms; counseling and establishing goals of care that are consistent with the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences; providing psychosocial, spiritual, and practical support, both to patients and their family caregivers; coordination across sites of care issues that are affecting access to and compliance with care; and helping with advance care planning and end of life care, including determining the need and timing of hospice care. (See <a href=\"#H1645160690\" class=\"local\">'What are the important components of palliative care?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no formal guidance from expert groups regarding when to initiate advanced care planning discussions in individuals with HIV infection, and no consensus on this issue. We recommend following the guidance of the well-established &ldquo;Respecting Choices&rdquo; paradigm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-issues-in-hiv-aids-in-adults/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>], which recommends a three-stage, prognosis-informed approach, which is outlined elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives#H90042096\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;, section on 'Facilitating the ACP'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant challenges to end of life care include decision-making about whether and when to stop HIV-related medications and when to refer for hospice care, given the significant prognostic uncertainty in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H3351820265\" class=\"local\">'Challenges in end of life care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic pain is common in individuals with HIV infection and includes both neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain. The goal of managing chronic pain is improvement of both pain and function (both physical and emotional). Given the paucity of evidence supporting benefit and increasing evidence about the harms of opioids in individuals with HIV infection, in our view, opioids should not be considered a first-line treatment option for chronic pain; other modalities, such as physical therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy or supportive psychotherapy, should be tried first.
