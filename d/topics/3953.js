(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Potassium replacement is primarily indicated when hypokalemia is due to potassium loss, and there is a significant deficit in body potassium. It is also warranted for acute therapy in disorders such as hypokalemic or thyrotoxic periodic paralysis in which the hypokalemia is due to redistribution of potassium into the cells, often in association with significant symptoms. Potassium is given cautiously in redistributive hypokalemia since the hypokalemia is transient and the administration of potassium can lead to rebound hyperkalemia when the underlying process is corrected and potassium moves back out of the cells. The recommended regimens for acute therapy in this disorder are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypokalemic periodic paralysis&quot;, section on 'Acute treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis&quot;, section on 'Acute treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Optimal therapy in patients with hypokalemia due to potassium loss is dependent upon the severity of the potassium deficit. In addition, somewhat different considerations are required to minimize continued urinary losses due to diuretic therapy, or less often, to primary hyperaldosteronism.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia will be reviewed here. The causes of and evaluation of patients with hypokalemia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-hypokalemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult patient with hypokalemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3819731\"><span class=\"h1\">MANIFESTATIONS OF HYPOKALEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of the manifestations of hypokalemia tends to be proportionate to the degree and duration of the reduction in serum potassium. Symptoms generally do not become manifest until the serum potassium is below 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> unless the serum potassium falls rapidly or the patient has a potentiating factor, such as a predisposition to arrhythmia due to the use of digitalis. Symptoms usually resolve with correction of the hypokalemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3819896\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe muscle weakness or rhabdomyolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle weakness usually does not occur at serum potassium concentrations above 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> if the hypokalemia develops slowly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, significant muscle weakness can occur at serum potassium concentrations below 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or at higher values with hypokalemia of acute onset, as occurs in hypokalemic or thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. In addition, the pathophysiology of weakness in these disorders is more complex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myopathies-of-systemic-disease#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myopathies of systemic disease&quot;, section on 'Hypokalemic myopathy'</a>.)</p><p>The pattern of weakness in hypokalemia is similar to that associated with hyperkalemia. Weakness usually begins in the lower extremities, progresses to the trunk and upper extremities, and can worsen to the point of paralysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Severe muscle weakness or paralysis'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to causing muscle weakness, severe potassium depletion (serum potassium less than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> can lead to muscle cramps, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. Potassium release from muscle cells during exercise normally mediates vasodilation and an appropriate increase in muscle blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Decreased potassium release due to profound hypokalemia can diminish blood flow to muscles during exertion, leading to ischemic rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The clinical and pathologic abnormalities are reversible with potassium repletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A potential diagnostic problem is that the release of potassium from the cells with rhabdomyolysis can mask the severity of the underlying hypokalemia or even lead to normal or high values. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-rhabdomyolysis#H31734850\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of rhabdomyolysis&quot;, section on 'Electrolyte disorders'</a>.)</p><p>Other manifestations of muscle dysfunction due to hypokalemia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory muscle weakness, which can be severe enough to result in respiratory failure and death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of gastrointestinal muscles, resulting in ileus and its associated symptoms of distension, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. The hypokalemia in some of these patients is caused by concomitant diarrhea. As an example, several reports have noted an association between colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome) and hypokalemia due to secretory diarrhea with an abnormally high fecal potassium content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

These include premature atrial and ventricular beats, sinus bradycardia, paroxysmal atrial or junctional tachycardia, atrioventricular block, and ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hypokalemia produces characteristic changes on the ECG although they are not seen in all patients. There is depression of the ST segment, decrease in the amplitude of the T wave, and an increase in the amplitude of U waves which occur at the end of the T wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73888\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73888 \">waveform 1</a>). U waves are often seen in the lateral precordial leads V4 to V6. Hypokalemia also prolongs the QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-miscellaneous-diagnoses#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Miscellaneous diagnoses&quot;, section on 'Hypokalemia'</a>.)</p><p>There is a large interpatient variability in the serum potassium concentration that is associated with progression of ECG changes or arrhythmias. In a carefully controlled trial of thiazide therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> there was a two-fold increase in ventricular arrhythmias (as detected by Holter monitoring) in the small proportion of patients in whom the serum potassium concentration fell to or below 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, the presence of concomitant factors, such as coronary ischemia, digitalis, increased beta-adrenergic activity, and magnesium depletion, can promote arrhythmias; the last two of these cofactors can also lower the serum potassium concentration:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> released during a stress response (as with coronary ischemia) drives potassium into the cells, possibly worsening preexisting hypokalemia. A similar effect can be seen with bronchodilator therapy with a beta-adrenergic agonist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H17666854\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Elevated beta-adrenergic activity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypokalemia may be associated with magnesium depletion (due, for example, to diuretics or diarrhea), both of which promote the development of arrhythmias. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are associated with an increased risk of torsades de pointes, particularly in patients treated with drugs that prolong the QT interval or those with a genetic predisposition to the long QT syndrome. In addition to its direct proarrhythmic effect, hypomagnesemia can increase urinary potassium losses and lower the serum potassium concentration.

The ease of generating an action potential (called membrane excitability) is related both to the magnitude of the resting membrane potential and to the activation state of membrane sodium channels. Opening the sodium channels leads to the passive diffusion of extracellular sodium into the cells, which is the primary step in this process.</p><p>According to the Nernst equation, the resting membrane potential is related to the ratio of the intracellular to the extracellular potassium concentration. In skeletal muscle, a reduction in the serum (extracellular) potassium concentration will increase this ratio and therefore hyperpolarize the cell membrane (that is, make the resting potential more electronegative); this impairs the ability of the muscle to depolarize and contract, leading to weakness. However, in some cardiac cells (such as Purkinje fibers in the conducting system), hypokalemia causes K2P1 channels, which are normally selective for potassium, to transport sodium into the cells, causing depolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. This leads to increased membrane excitability and arrhythmias.</p><p>Hypokalemia also delays ventricular repolarization by inhibiting the activity of potassium channels responsible for this component of the cardiac electrical cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The patient should be evaluated for the functional manifestations of hypokalemia, and the potassium deficit should be estimated.

The urgency of therapy depends upon the severity of hypokalemia, associated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> comorbid conditions, and the rate of decline in serum potassium concentration. The risk of arrhythmia from hypokalemia is highest in older patients, patients with organic heart disease, and patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> or antiarrhythmic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Potassium replacement is the mainstay of therapy in hypokalemia. Such therapy is clearly warranted in patients with hypokalemia due to renal or gastrointestinal losses. It should also be considered when hypokalemia is due to redistribution of potassium from the extracellular fluid into the cells (eg, hypokalemic periodic paralysis, insulin therapy) if serious complications such as paralysis, rhabdomyolysis, or arrhythmias are present or imminent.

The risk of rebound hyperkalemia is particularly high in patients with hypokalemic or thyrotoxic periodic paralysis in whom rebound hyperkalemia has been described in 40 to 60 percent of treated attacks.

Estimation of the potassium deficit and careful monitoring of the serum potassium helps to prevent hyperkalemia due to excessive supplementation.

Hypokalemia may also result from the transient entry of potassium into cells, which is called redistributive hypokalemia. (See <a href=\"#H3819676\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manifestations of hypokalemia include severe muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, renal abnormalities, and glucose intolerance. These signs and symptoms are generally proportionate to the degree and rapidity of the reduction in serum potassium and resolve with correction of the hypokalemia. The risk of arrhythmias from hypokalemia is highest in older patients, patients with organic heart disease, and patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> or antiarrhythmic drugs. (See <a href=\"#H3819731\" class=\"local\">'Manifestations of hypokalemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H45915444\" class=\"local\">'General issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The underlying cause of the hypokalemia should be identified, particularly the presence of hypomagnesemia or redistributive hypokalemia. Patients with hypomagnesemia can be refractory to potassium replacement alone, and potassium replacement can result in rebound hyperkalemia in patients with redistributive hypokalemia. Among patients with redistributive hypokalemia due to increased sympathetic tone (as in hypokalemic thyrotoxic periodic paralysis), the administration of a nonselective beta blocker, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, can rapidly reverse the hypokalemia and associated symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H8647773\" class=\"local\">'Hypomagnesemia and redistributive hypokalemia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis&quot;, section on 'Acute treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral potassium preparations include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a>, potassium bicarbonate or its precursors (potassium citrate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium acetate</a>), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium phosphate</a>. Potassium chloride can be given in crystalline form (salt substitutes), as a liquid, or in a slow-release tablet or capsule. Potassium bicarbonate or its precursors is preferred in patients with hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. Potassium phosphate should be considered only in patients with hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, as might occur with proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis associated with Fanconi syndrome and phosphate wasting.

This combination must be used with extreme caution in patients with decreased kidney function and in patients on an ACE inhibitor, renin inhibitor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angiotensin receptor blocker. We suggest monitoring the serum potassium concentration approximately every three to four months in all patients receiving chronic potassium supplementation, or more often if clinically indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium must be given more rapidly to patients with hypokalemia that is severe (serum potassium less than 2.5 to 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> or symptomatic (arrhythmias, marked muscle weakness, or rhabdomyolysis). In such patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> can be given orally in doses of 40 mEq, three to four times per day or, particularly in patients also treated with intravenous potassium, 20 mEq every two to three hours. Careful monitoring of the serum potassium is also essential. We suggest that the serum potassium should initially be measured every two to four hours to ascertain the response to therapy. If tolerated, this regimen should be continued until the serum potassium concentration is persistently above 3.0 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and symptoms or signs attributable to hypokalemia have resolved. (See <a href=\"#H3820210\" class=\"local\">'Severe or symptomatic hypokalemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe manifestations of hypokalemia or those who are unable to take oral medications, we recommend intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3819731\" class=\"local\">'Manifestations of hypokalemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3820183\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Depending upon the severity of symptoms, intravenous potassium may be given at doses ranging from 20 mEq every two to three hours to a recommended maximum rate of potassium administration of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/hour</span> for most patients; rates as high as 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/hour</span> have been used for life-threatening hypokalemia. Rates above 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/hour</span> are highly irritating to peripheral veins. When such high rates are given, they should be infused into a large central vein or into multiple peripheral veins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, the maximum amount of potassium that is added to each particular sized infusion container should be limited in order to decrease the risk of inadvertent administration of a large absolute amount of potassium. We suggest the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In any 1000 mL-sized container of appropriate non-dextrose fluid, we suggest a maximum of 60 mEq of potassium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a small-volume mini-bag of 100 to 200 mL of water that is to be infused into a peripheral vein, we suggest 10 mEq of potassium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a small-volume mini-bag of 100 mL of water that is to be infused into a large central vein, we suggest a maximum of 40 mEq of potassium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous potassium is most often infused in a peripheral vein at concentrations of 20 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in a non-dextrose-containing saline solution. Use of an infusion pump is preferred to prevent overly rapid potassium administration in any intravenous container with more than 40 mEq of potassium or if the desired rate of potassium administration is more than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/hour</span>.
