Medical professionals who would logically be involved in such events include, among others, radiation safety officers, radiation oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, emergency department physicians, hematologists, medical oncologists, infectious disease specialists, and gastroenterologists. All will be asked to play a significant role in evaluating and treating victims of an accidental or deliberate exposure to radiation. Due to their experience in managing patients with cytopenias <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> marrow aplasia, hematologists and medical oncologists will most likely be asked to take primary responsibility or a consultative role for the medical treatment of individuals exposed to a moderate or high dose of radiation.</p><p>However, all physicians, and especially medical triage personnel, must have an understanding of how radiation alters the function of cells, tissues, and organ systems, how radiation levels are quantified, and how victims receiving a significant radiation dose can be recognized and treated. In addition, all medical facilities should have a radiation emergency contingency plan with which their employees are familiar. Emergency personnel and hospital personnel must also be aware of local, state, and national resources that may be employed in the case of a radiological event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>General aspects of radiation biology and the clinical features of radiation injury in the adult will be discussed here.

Non-ionizing radiation has long or very long wavelengths, ranging from a fraction of a micrometer (eg, ultraviolet [UV] light) to millions of meters (eg, static fields), and includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, and the visible portion of the spectrum into the UV light range.</p><p>Non-ionizing radiation generally causes damage to biological tissues through direct or indirect transfer of thermal (heat) energy. Examples include microwave heating and the sunburn response (eg, acute inflammation with erythema, induration, and heat). It is believed that UVB (wavelength of 280 to 315 nm) is responsible for the sunburn response by damaging DNA in keratinocytes. In addition to damaging DNA (by inducing the formation of cyclic photoproducts of pyrimidine bases), UV radiation induces reactive oxygen species to cause oxidative damage to the plasma membrane, and triggers a host of signaling cascades that include the release of prostaglandins (particularly PGE2) that mediate the local response in the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8511751\"><span class=\"h2\">Ionizing radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ionizing radiation has energy that is sufficiently high to displace electrons, thereby creating charged particles (eg, ions). It has very short wavelengths, ranging downward from nanometers to a million millionth of a meter (10<sup>-12</sup>), and includes higher frequency UV radiation, alpha particles (ie, helium with two protons and two neutrons), beta particles (essentially electrons with an electrical charge of -1 and an atomic mass of <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2000<sup>th</sup></span> that of a proton or neutron), x-rays, and gamma rays. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha particles </strong>&ndash; Alpha particles do not penetrate clothing or the skin. However, they are harmful when ingested or inhaled. Radionuclides that emit alpha particles include americium-241, plutonium-236, uranium-238, thorium-232, radium-226, polonium-210, and radon-222.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beta particles</strong> &ndash; Beta particles are much smaller than alpha particles, permitting them to penetrate into subcutaneous tissues. They penetrate paper (unlike alpha particles which are blocked by paper), and are blocked by wood or brick. They are particularly harmful when ingested or inhaled. Examples of beta emitters include tritium, cobalt-60, strontium-90, technetium-99, iodine-129, iodine-131, and cesium-137.</p><p/><p>Having no mass or electrical charge, x-rays and gamma rays are pure electromagnetic energy that is measured as photons. They penetrate tissues and expose all organs. They are blocked by a concrete wall. Although x-rays generally have a longer wave length than do gamma rays, and are generally emitted by electrons rather than the atomic nucleus (compared with gamma rays, which may be released from the nucleus), there is no common definition that absolutely distinguishes x-rays from gamma rays.</p><p>Unlike chemical reactions, in which electrons are removed from the outermost orbits of an atom, ionizing radiation displaces electrons from multiple orbits, creating unstable atoms (eg, radionuclides). As the radionuclide emits energy (ie, &quot;disintegrates&quot;), it transforms into a different isotope of the same element through a process known as &quot;radioactive decay.&quot; Decay products are also often radioactive and achieve stability after subsequent decays, releasing energy as particles or rays at each step. Such &quot;decay chains&quot; are characteristic for a radionuclide.</p><p>Ionizing radiation can exert both direct and indirect effects on living cells. It damages cells by directly interacting with DNA bases, proteins, and lipids of cellular membranes; or by interacting with other molecules (primarily water) to generate free radicals that in turn damage DNA and other cellular structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">UNITS OF RADIATION DOSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The amount of radiation (eg, radiation dose) absorbed by the patient's tissues is highly predictive of its biological effects. Such doses are defined as the amount of energy of <strong>ionizing</strong> radiation deposited per unit of tissue mass at a specific point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8511751\" class=\"local\">'Ionizing radiation'</a> above.)</p><p>The terms most often used for quantifying radioactivity, radiation dose, and radiation injury are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74125\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74125 \">table 1</a>). Those that will be employed in this review are defined below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Absorbed dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <strong>rad</strong> (radiation absorbed dose) is the traditional unit of absorbed dose and is defined as the transfer of 100 ergs per gram of tissue. </p><p>The rad has been superseded in the Syst&egrave;me International (SI) by the <strong>Gray</strong> (Gy). One Gy (100 cGy), the unit most commonly used to measure radiation therapy dose, is equivalent to 100 rad (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">joule/kilogram);</span> one cGy is equivalent to 1 rad. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose equivalent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <strong>rem</strong> (Roentgen equivalent in man) is a unit for the dose equivalent and represents the product of the absorbed dose (in rads) and weighting factors that take into account the differential sensitivity among tissues as well as the biological effectiveness (&quot;quality factor&quot;) of various sources of ionizing radiation (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cellular effects of radiation'</a> below). </p><p>The rem has been superseded in the SI by the <strong>Sievert</strong> (Sv). One Sv (1000 mSv) is equivalent to 100 rem. </p><p>For most therapeutic radiation exposures (eg, x-rays, gamma rays) the Sievert and Gray are approximately equal. However, when there is exposure to highly ionizing particles (eg, neutrons, alpha particles) the radiation dose equivalent (in Sv) reflects resulting tissue damage better than the absorbed dose (in Gy). As an example, the quality factor for x-rays, gamma rays, and beta particles is 1, while that for alpha particles is 20, and the factor can range from 4 to 22 for neutrons, depending on neutron energy.</p><p>This difference between the Sv and the Gy becomes especially important for estimating the effect from a radiation dose whenever highly ionizing particles are part of the exposure. For example, the dose from a &quot;mixed field&quot; exposure to gamma rays and neutrons is more accurately measured in Sv than in Gy. Examples of a mixed field exposure are those from the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear power plant disasters, and the atomic bomb detonations over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the case of a mixed field exposure involving gamma rays and neutrons, a conversion from Gy to Sv is made by applying a factor that accounts for the relative biologic effect of the fission neutron spectrum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The &quot;dose rate&quot; refers to the amount of radiation delivered per unit of time and is most often measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">Gy/hour</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">rads/hour</span>. Geiger-M&#971;ller (G-M) counters typically provide an estimate of dose rate that may, in turn, be used to estimate the degree of hazard in a particular environment (eg, accident scene, patient clothing or bodily wastes). Common, hand-held G-M counters are suitable for monitoring radioactive sources emitting gamma rays, but more specialized equipment is required for sources emitting certain low energy beta particles, neutrons, and alpha particles.</p><p>For cases involving exposure to x-rays, gamma rays and beta particles, a reduction in the radiation dose rate results in a decreased radiation response. For example, it is believed that the carcinogenic effect of these radiations delivered at a lower dose rate is less than that of the same total dose delivered at a higher dose rate. Similarly, a dose of 1 Gy delivered over one minute might cause signs and symptoms of acute radiation injury, whereas the same dose delivered over 100 days would not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Counts per unit time read on a G-M meter can be converted to an activity (disintegrations per unit time) if the type of radiation and the type and efficiency of G-M meter are known. Efficiency varies from 2 to 32 percent, with an average of approximately 10 percent. Assuming a 10 percent efficiency, one count correlates with approximately 10 disintegrations. One Curie (Ci) is equivalent to 37 giga-Becquerels (Bq), which is equivalent to approximately 2.2 million disintegrations. Therefore, the number of counts per unit time can be converted to Bq per unit time or Ci per unit time. </p><p>Each nuclide has a specific gamma ray constant with units of mSv per mBq per hour (Roentgen per mCi per hour) at one centimeter from the source. One can determine whether the dose is clinically significant by comparing the estimated dose rate (in disintegrations, Bq, or Ci) to published information on the annual limit intake (ALI) estimated to be the highest limit for that nuclide over a one-year period of time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H644808\"><span class=\"h2\">Effective dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effective dose is a measurement of dose that takes into account the type (or &quot;quality&quot;) of radiation and the relative sensitivity of the exposed <span class=\"nowrap\">organ/tissue,</span> as determined by the weighting factor for that <span class=\"nowrap\">organ/tissue</span>. The effective dose is defined as the product of the equivalent dose in tissue and the tissue weighting factor summed over all tissues. It is useful for comparing studies and exposure types. For example, to compare the cancer risk from a 4 mSv dose to the lung (whose weighting factor is 0.12) with a similar dose to the whole body, one multiplies 4 mSv by 0.12 to derive an effective dose of 0.48 mSv. Accordingly, the cancer risk from a lung dose of 4 mSv is approximately the same as that from a whole-body dose of 0.48 mSv. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Examples of radiation exposures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical sources of radiation contribute the greatest amount to the average annual radiation dose in most populations, but the environment, including food and water, also contribute. </p><p>In 1980, the average annual radiation dose to persons residing in the United States was approximately 3.6 mSv (360 mrem) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; this corresponds to an absorbed dose of approximately 3.6 mGy (360 mrad). By 2006, the average per-person annual dose increased to approximately 6.1 mSv (610 mrem), a change driven primarily by an increase in exposures from computed tomography (CT) scanning, nuclear medicine studies, interventional procedures, and other radiologic exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Accordingly, over a 26-year period, the average dose per-person from medical procedures increased by nearly sixfold, from 0.54 mSv (54 mrem) to 3.2 mSv (320 mrem). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2679298688\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following examples describe doses that might be seen with various exposures from medical imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A standard chest x-ray delivers a dose of 0.06 to 0.11 mSv (6 to 11 mrem). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A two-view mammogram delivers a dose of 0.72 mSv (72 mrem). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A full body CT scan and standard chest CT deliver doses of 10 mSv (1000 mrem) and 7 mSv (700 mrem), respectively. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A full-body combined positron emission tomography (PET)-CT scan delivers approximately 25 mSv (2500 mrem [2.5 rem]), but exposure is influenced by the isotope used (usually <sup>18</sup>F) for the PET component, the individual&rsquo;s weight and body habitus, and the nature of the CT scan. </p><p/><p>One study found that 7 percent of patients admitted to a mixed use adult surgical intensive care unit received an effective dose that exceeded 50 mSv (5000 mrad) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The majority of the dose was due to CT scans, prompting the recommendation that the benefits and risks of CT scans should be carefully assessed before ordering this imaging test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Radiation doses associated with CT scanning and other radiologic procedures have raised concerns about incremental risks for cancer, particularly in children whose relatively long life expectancy (compared with adults) and rapid organ growth make them especially vulnerable to the potential carcinogenic effects of radiation.

The radiation dose may inform clinical management, taken in context with the patient&rsquo;s medical history and clinical findings. Therefore, clinicians should obtain information on the radiation doses to which their patients have been externally exposed. For a mass casualty scenario, this requires that they work together with local radiation experts including radiation safety officers and health physicists, and possibly with members of federal consequence management teams, civil support teams, and other first responder groups. Clinicians who function as first responders in the field and first receivers in the emergency department require a rudimentary understanding of what is a significant radiation dose (eg, a dose that has a predictable biological effect in humans and that informs medical triage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical management).</p><p>In an example scenario, incoming patients exposed to a radiation source may be categorized as having received a low (&lt;1 Gy or &lt;100 rad), moderate (1 to 3 Gy or 100 to 300 rad), high (3 to 9 Gy or 300 to 900 rad), or lethal (&gt;10 Gy or 1,000 rad) dose of radiation. In the absence of vomiting, physical trauma or burns, individuals receiving a low dose should be triaged to the ambulatory setting (typically, to home) for follow-up with a physician and possible enrollment in an epidemiological study. Those receiving a moderate dose either should be admitted to an acute care facility for further evaluation or should be observed in the ambulatory setting. Those receiving a high or lethal dose should be admitted to an acute care facility for definitive therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palliative care. &#160;</p><p>In another scenario, individuals may have internal contamination instead of (or in addition to) external contamination. The entry of radionuclides into the three-dimensional confines of the body may occur through ingestion, inhalation, absorption via a wound, or intravenous injection into the circulation. The case of Alexander Litvinenko represents an internal contamination by ingestion of Polonium 210 (Po-210), a pure alpha particle emitter consisting of two protons and two neutrons, identical to a helium nucleus. On November 23, 2006, Mr. Litvinenko was pronounced dead at University Hospital, London, UK, 22 days after drinking contaminated tea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A formal inquiry concluded that Mr. Litvinenko had been poisoned with Po-210. The hospital toxicologist raised the possibility of poisoning with thallium, a chemical toxin that causes symptoms similar to those caused by Po-210, including abdominal pain, bone marrow failure, and multi-organ failure leading to death. However, an imaging study of the patient's peripheral blood smear indicated the presence of radioactivity by opacification of radiography film by the uncovered (but not covered) portion of the smear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This result is consistent with a radioactive substance that emits alpha particles, which are blocked by thin materials such as paper, skin, or a glass coverslip. Gamma-ray spectroscopy of a urine sample disclosed a characteristic photo-emission at 803 keV, and ultimately the diagnosis of Po-210 poisoning was confirmed. </p><p>Multiple types of information should be used to assess radiation dose. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical dose estimates</strong> &ndash; Characterization of the radiation source (eg, its radionuclide composition and activity), radiation distribution in the environment over time, and <span class=\"nowrap\">location/activity</span> of the exposed individual, including duration of exposure. Dose estimates are made by medical physicists, radiation safety officers (RSOs), and physicians who are knowledgeable in dose assessment and the conduct of surveys for contamination of patients. Realizing that many of these radiation experts may not have practical knowledge of medical management, it is important that clinicians communicate their needs in simple but accurate terms without abbreviations or extraneous information. Likewise, health physicists and RSOs must avoid technical jargon when explaining dose assessment and vital information such as dose, dose rate (and how rate may be used to estimate dose), contamination and decontamination, risk, and regulatory limits on dose such as the annual limits on intake (ALIs) and derived reference levels (DRLs). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Physical measurement'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Presenting signs and symptoms</strong> &ndash; In addition to physical dose measurements made with instruments such as Geiger-Mueller (G-M) detectors, presenting clinical signs and symptoms may be the only information available to the treating clinician for estimating individual radiation does. A decline in the absolute lymphocyte count and the appearance of vomiting within one hour are particularly informative. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical signs and symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biological and clinical dosimetric techniques</strong> &ndash; Of all methods, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) is the &quot;gold standard&quot; for assessment of individual whole-body absorbed dose. However, four to five days are required to obtain results of DCA analysis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Chromosomal changes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Information from all of these approaches should be integrated to develop the most accurate and timely assessment of radiation dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Dosimetric information should be communicated to clinicians as soon as it is available. A rapid, multiparameter, integrated approach to dose assessment is especially important in the case of mass casualties, as demands will be high and resources will be limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical dosimetry can provide an estimate of individual external dose, using a whole-body radiation dosimeter (G-M meter). While sensitive and precise measurements of dose can be made, few whole-body dosimeters are available for rapid assessment of whole-body dose. Reconstruction of dose can be made with considerable sensitivity, using environmental measurements combined with time-integrated activity of the person [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Measurements of radioactivity in the air, plants, buildings, and ground are combined with an individual's activity over time to reconstruct a dose for the purpose of epidemiological studies. However, this is a time-consuming process that is impractical in an emergency situation, particularly when there are many potentially exposed persons.</p><p>In the case of pure internal contamination with material composed of only alpha particles, a G-M meter will not detect any external radiation signal at all; this is what occurred with Polonium-201 poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, because the activity of this pure alpha emitter was blocked by overlying intact skin and internal tissues, as described above. (See <a href=\"#H1761566129\" class=\"local\">'Overview of radiation dose assessment'</a> above.) </p><p>Estimation of internal radiation dose from the deposition of radioactive materials, such as alpha emitters (eg, plutonium, americium, californium), and beta-gamma emitters (eg, cesium, cobalt, iodine) into the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and other tissues, requires detection with special instrumentation (such as ion chambers and spectroscopes). In this case, measurements are made on body fluids (urine and saliva), nasal swipes, fecal samples, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> expired air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic and clinical markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To assess the biological dose (sometimes referred to as the &quot;biodose&quot;), individual biomarkers for evaluation of radiation exposure have been sought from the beginning of the nuclear age.

The structural details of these aberrations are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chromosomal-translocations-deletions-and-inversions#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chromosomal translocations, deletions, and inversions&quot;, section on 'Translocations'</a>.)</p><p>The presence of chromosomal aberrations is currently the &quot;gold standard&quot; for biodosimetry. The frequency of dicentrics and rings can detect a radiation dose of as low as 1 Gy (100 mGy), and these changes persist for six months and possibly longer. In this setting, the formation of dicentrics involves the end-to-end joining of two separate chromosomes both damaged by ionizing radiation, resulting in a chromosome containing two centromeres. Ring formation involves a break in the arm of a single damaged chromatid, followed by rejoining to form a ring and a fragment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Both dicentrics and rings are the consequence of two distinct, radiation-induced chromosomal breaks. Dicentric chromosomes are &quot;unstable&quot; aberrations that are lethal to the cell. As the affected cells die, the accuracy of dose estimation by scoring dicentrics is reduced (hence, the &quot;window&quot; of approximately six months for persistence of dicentrics as a reliable biomarker). In contrast, chromosomal translocations are &quot;stable&quot; aberrations that persist for many years, as they are passed on to the cell's progeny.</p><p>The frequency of most aberrations follows a linear-quadratic relationship with dose. At low doses, chromosomal breakage results from the passage of the same charged particle through the cell's nucleus, damaging one or more chromosomes in the process, and is a linear function of dose. At high doses, chromosomal breaks are more likely to be caused by the passage of multiple charged particles, resulting in an interaction that is a quadratic function of dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The detection of chromosomal aberrations is facilitated by the application of hybridization probes for centromeres and the use of an automated metaphase detector [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The blood sample may be drawn immediately after a suspected whole-body exposure. However, for a suspected partial body exposure, the blood sample should be drawn at 12 to 24 hours after exposure to permit time for lymphocytes residing in the exposed tissues to enter the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. For triage purposes, as few as 20 metaphases may be scored to provide a preliminary estimate of dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

As an example, at doses of &gt;6 Gy (6000 mGy), virtually all victims will develop vomiting within one hour, with the time to vomiting being inversely proportional to the absorbed dose. However, at doses of &lt;4 Gy, vomiting is less common (only one-half of patients receiving a dose of 3 Gy will vomit), and its absence cannot be used to reliably exclude a low or moderate dose. A reassessment of reported times to emesis showed a relative error of 200 percent for the prediction of a dose of 2 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>An international consensus document developed with the assistance of the World Health Organization has recommended that clinicians use as many sources of information on radiation dose as available in order to assess prognosis and guide therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Many effects of radiation are predictable based on dose (deterministic effects), while others are random (stochastic), such as development of cancer. The early health consequences of accidental exposures to radiation around the world have been documented in two registries: the Radiation Emergency <span class=\"nowrap\">Assistance/Training</span> Center Site located in Oak Ridge, TN (<a href=\"http://www.nnsa.energy.gov/aboutus/ourprograms/emergencyoperationscounterterrorism/respondingtoemergencies-0-3&amp;token=ZB6Iw9v/z24seVpq8ikOG0/HzAYfU31qWx6gJZxUg6H0Lyk1C4aEA6BCSTP4sJB6elbwWWh6vpcNYUv8KCHicSjxOvzL7aaUarNG9E5bNeEmLLONOeo3jBNxHhThHJGQ&amp;TOPIC_ID=8367\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">REAC/TS Registry</a>), and the University of Ulm and Bundeswehr Institute of Radiobiology located in Munich, Germany (Ulm Registry). &#160;</p><p>Ionizing radiation may interact directly with intracellular targets or may interact with other molecules (eg, water) to produce free radicals that, in turn, reach and damage a target (eg, DNA, mRNA, proteins, plasma membrane). Depending upon the amount of ionization deposited along a unit length of track of radiation, the chance of achieving a &quot;hit&quot; on a critical cellular target will vary. Low linear energy transfer (LET) sources of radiation (eg, x-rays, gamma-rays) produce sparse ionization, while high LET radiation sources (eg, alpha particles, neutrons) are characterized by dense ionization.</p><p>The following observations have been made concerning the effects of ionizing radiation on human tissue:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiosensitivity varies directly with the rate of cellular proliferation.

As an example, cells at the growth plate in bone, which have not yet developed into bone or cartilage, are more sensitive than those of the diaphysis.

Alterations in the distribution of lymphocytes among various compartments (such as the blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen) may also play a role in dose-dependent declines of the absolute lymphocyte count.

They are of two types, deterministic and stochastic:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <strong>deterministic effect</strong> (also known as a &quot;tissue reaction&quot;) is one in which the severity is determined by the dose (eg, depression of blood counts). A dose threshold (ie, a dose below which an effect is not seen) is characteristic of this effect. As an example, the threshold absorbed dose for a &quot;deterministic effect&quot; on bone marrow (0.5 Gy) is lower than that for all other organs, except for the testis (0.15 Gy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <strong>stochastic effect</strong> represents an outcome for which the probability of occurrence (rather than severity) is determined by the dose. It is sometimes referred to as a random effect of radiation. An example is radiation-induced carcinogenesis, which occurs after a prolonged and variable delay (latency) after exposure. Most radiation biologists believe that stochastic effects do not have an apparent threshold dose, implying that any dose, no matter how low, has a carcinogenic effect. This relationship is referred to as the linear, no-threshold (ie, LNT) model of carcinogenesis. However, others argue that too much uncertainty exists regarding the risk of cancer induction at very low doses (ie, doses of less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mSv/0</span>.05 Sv or 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mGy/0</span>.05 Gy), and that the LNT model is invalid. Moreover, the LNT model does not explain results of laboratory investigations which have often shown a lack of biological effects at very low doses.

Depending on the dose, acute changes may occur within minutes to days or weeks, and may include injury to the skin, bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurovascular system. Chronic changes may take many months or years to become evident, and include the development of cutaneous ulcers, malignancy (eg, thyroid cancer, leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer), growth retardation in children, cataracts, infertility, and fetal abnormalities. The stochastic effects of ionizing radiation (eg, induction of malignancy) will not be discussed here.</p><p>Radiation exposure can result in local radiation injury, partial-body injury, or whole-body injury (nearly always a non-uniform exposure). Limited partial-body injury is assessed and managed as a local injury, and more extensive (eg, significant) partial-body injury is assessed and managed as a whole-body injury (eg, acute radiation syndrome). There are no clear distinguishing criteria for limited versus extensive partial body injury, and the distinction is made based on clinical judgement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H645598\"><span class=\"h2\">Local radiation injury (LRI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local radiation injury (LRI) involves a sufficiently small body part so that there is no, or a minimal, whole-body dose. Therefore, there are no clinical signs and symptoms of acute radiation syndrome. LRI typically involves a very small percentage of the skin, subcutaneous tissues, and sometimes deeper tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. In addition to cutaneous injuries, examples of LRI include extremity injuries and <span class=\"nowrap\">hypospermia/azoospermia</span> in males whose lower bodies have been exposed. Approximately one-third of individuals recorded in the Radiation Emergency Assistance <span class=\"nowrap\">Center/Training</span> Site <span class=\"nowrap\">(REAC/TS)</span> registry between 1944 and 1986 had LRI following exposure to 600 rems (6 Sv) or greater.</p><p>Although injury is highly localized, circulating lymphocytes may exhibit dicentrics and ring forms, and circulating blood counts may be mildly depressed. This is largely due to the migration of lymphocytes from irradiated tissues into the circulation, the passage of unexposed lymphocytes through irradiated tissues, and the release of humoral factors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microvesicles expressing the Fas ligand (eg, the &quot;death ligand&quot;) that are shed from the plasma membrane of irradiated cells (resulting in an &quot;abscopal&quot; or distant effect of radiation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Provocatively, the transplanted cells of a victim of the Tokai-mura, Japan radiation accident in 1999 exhibited cytogenetic abnormalities, indicating that these donor cells were likely exposed to radiation in vivo following their infusion.</p><p>Injuries to the skin and extremity can vary from epilation and mild erythema at local skin doses of 300 to 600 cGy (3 to 6 Gy) to wet desquamation and blister formation at 2000 to 5000 cGy (20 to 50 Gy), and necrosis of the skin, muscle, and bone at doses of &gt;5000 cGy (50 Gy). Ultrasonography and thermography have been used to assess the depth of involvement beneath the skin surface in patients with LRI. The presence of fluid and &quot;hot&quot; spots can identify injury in the subcutaneous tissues, including underlying adipose, muscle, and bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The dose to subcutaneous tissues varies as the inverse of the square of the distance beneath the skin surface. Epidermal atrophy, loss of rete ridges, swollen collagen fibers, and thickened dermis can be seen with chronic radiation fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>The presence of acute radiation syndrome (ARS) negatively impacts healing of LRI due to impaired immunity, infections, and bleeding. The converse is also true: the presence of LRI dramatically affected the clinical course and outcome of victims of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster, as it was considered to be a primary cause of death in more than one-half of the lethal cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>The management of LRI is discussed separately.

Symptoms arising from such exposures are referred to as radiation sickness or acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Classically, the threshold dose for ARS is a whole-body or significant partial-body irradiation of greater than 1 Gy delivered at a relatively high dose rate.</p><p>ARS is best thought of as a group of four overlapping organ-system toxicities, which include cerebrovascular, gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, and cutaneous syndromes; development of these toxicities may be concurrent or sequential (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53570\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53570 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrovascular syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>ARS also progresses through several temporal phases. Acute changes, which are seen within the first hours to weeks following exposure (depending upon the radiation absorbed dose, dose equivalent, and dose rate), include clinical signs and symptoms resulting mainly from damage to the skin, central nervous system, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and hematopoietic tissue. (See <a href=\"#H646514\" class=\"local\">'Phases of ARS'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15159511\" class=\"local\">'Summary of correlation of early symptoms with radiation dose'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H646514\"><span class=\"h3\">Phases of ARS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four main phases of ARS that identify time periods after exposure. Each phase is characterized by a unique time of onset and duration. The severity of clinical signs and symptoms during each phase is highly correlated with radiation dose, as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prodromal phase &ndash; </strong>Prodromal symptoms typically occur during the first 48 to 72 hours following exposure, but may occur within minutes of exposure or develop up to six days after exposure, depending on dose. They include anorexia, apathy, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, tachycardia, headache, fluid shifts, and electrolyte imbalance. Prodromal symptoms and signs are generally mild or absent at doses of &lt;1 to 2 Gy; moderate at doses of 3 to 5 Gy; severe at doses of 6 to 9 Gy; and merge into confusion, loss of consciousness, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse at doses of 10 Gy or greater. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrovascular syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Latent phase</strong> &ndash; The latent phase is a brief time period characterized by improvement of clinical signs and symptoms. It may last for several days to a month, depending on dose. The duration of this phase is inversely related to the dose of radiation received, and is typically absent at doses of 9 to 10 Gy or greater.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Manifest illness phase</strong> &ndash; The manifest illness phase is characterized by overt clinical signs and symptoms specific to one or more of the four typical syndromes. Depending on dose, it may last weeks to months, and may be complicated by mild or intense immunosuppression due to radiation-induced lymphocytopenia, neutropenia, reduced T cell (TH1 and TH2) number <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function, and impaired lymphokine gene expression. At high doses, impaired immunity predisposes to infection, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), all of which lead to multi-organ failure (MOF) and a high mortality rate. If the person survives the manifest illness phase, recovery is likely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Death or recovery phase</strong> &ndash; Persons receiving a dose of 5 to 6 Gy or greater have a significant risk of dying, particularly if mechanical trauma or burns are also present. Those receiving a dose of 9 to 10 Gy are unlikely to recover, regardless of therapy. No individual has survived a dose of 10 Gy or greater, although it has been suggested that optimal therapy that includes cytokines and excellent critical care (eg, pulmonary suctioning and mechanical ventilation; skin grafts and consistent surgical follow-up for debridement, drainage of abscesses, IV catheter placement, and emergency surgery; prompt antibiotics for prophylaxis and therapy for typical and atypical bacterial, viral and fungal infections; frequent blood, sputum, urine and wound cultures and appropriate imaging tests; timely transfusion of blood products and careful management of fluids and electrolytes) in a modern intensive care unit, have had a longer survival than expected based on radiation dose. Those who recover will require close follow-up for the first year, owing to the need for re-vaccination and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, and to the high risk of typical and unusual infections, as aberrant immune reconstitution is likely to persist in those who have had a significant exposure. Survivors will require life-long follow-up to monitor for long-term complications, such as organ dysfunction and carcinogenesis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15159511\"><span class=\"h3\">Summary of correlation of early symptoms with radiation dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are general observations concerning the relationship between presenting clinical signs and symptoms and the absorbed dose:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prodromal syndrome is generally mild or absent at total body doses of 1 to 2 Gy or less.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of symptoms within the first two hours usually indicates a significant and potentially lethal exposure exceeding 3 to 4 Gy. At these doses, sloughing of the gastrointestinal epithelium and significant cytopenias also occur (ie, the gastrointestinal syndrome), adding to the symptomatology. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic syndrome'</a> below.)<br/><br/>At doses between 2 to 10 Gy, it is difficult to establish a prognosis based solely on the existence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severity of presenting signs and symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At high doses (eg, 10 to &gt;20 Gy), severe symptoms occur in virtually all patients within minutes of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/97-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">97-99</a>]. These signs and symptoms gradually merge into loss of consciousness and hypotension, components of the cerebrovascular syndrome. Death often occurs within a few days to weeks after such exposures. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrovascular syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Accordingly, a rapid and severe prodromal response is the harbinger of a poor clinical outcome that may be later complicated by a severe form of the gastrointestinal and hematopoietic syndromes. The time to onset of vomiting in the prodromal phase, when present, can be used to estimate radiation dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82508\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82508 \">table 2</a>), although its absence does not preclude a significant exposure. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical signs and symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic syndrome'</a> below.).</p><p>Evaluation of clinical signs and symptoms specific to four organ systems (the cerebrovascular, gastrointestinal, hematologic, and the cutaneous systems) is required for triage of victims, selection of appropriate therapy, and determination of prognosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of radiation injury in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additional correlations between the findings of the syndromes the phases of ARS, and overall prognosis include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost all persons who present with the cerebrovascular syndrome will die. Those who live long enough will also develop a severe form of the gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity before death. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrovascular syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals who do not present with the cerebrovascular syndrome, but who develop gastrointestinal toxicity, may survive with appropriate medical support. However, all of these individuals will likely develop the hematologic syndrome if they survive long enough. Presentation with mild gastrointestinal symptoms limited to one or two episodes of diarrhea with associated abdominal pain is accompanied by virtually certain recovery. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with minimal gastrointestinal signs and symptoms may still develop the hematologic syndrome, with a potentially fatal outcome. Those with mild to moderate prodromal symptoms, absence of the gastrointestinal syndrome, and minimal evidence of bone marrow suppression have an estimated survival in excess of 90 percent. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cutaneous syndrome may develop in any of the above scenarios. The presence of cutaneous injury such as wet desquamation, thermal burns, blisters, and ulcers negatively impacts prognosis and complicates medical management. The presence of mechanical trauma also increases mortality on a dose for dose basis. Consultation with a dermatologist and a radiation expert is necessary to treat individuals with the cutaneous syndrome appropriately. Consultation with a subspecialty surgeon is needed for individuals with mechanical trauma. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Cerebrovascular syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cerebrovascular syndrome of ARS, also called the neurovascular syndrome or central nervous system (CNS) syndrome, results from localized changes in the CNS. These include impaired capillary circulation with damage to the blood-brain barrier, interstitial edema, acute inflammation, petechial hemorrhages, inflammation of the meninges, and hypertrophy of perivascular astrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Paroxysmal spike and wave discharges may be evident on the electroencephalography (EEG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>], and the presence of edema and dystrophic calcifications may be documented by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head.</p><p>In general, mild cerebrovascular symptoms may occur at whole-body doses of 3 to 4 Gy, and symptoms may become severe at whole-body doses in excess of 10 Gy. At doses in excess of 10 Gy, all phases of injury (eg, from prodrome to death) are usually compressed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53121\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53121 \">table 4</a>). As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence, within minutes of exposure, of fever, hypotension, and major impairment of cognitive function, along with severe anorexia, nausea, and vomiting suggests that the person has been exposed to a supra-lethal dose of radiation (ie, more than 20 to 30 Gy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with lesser, but still fatal, exposures to the CNS, in the range of 10 to 20 Gy, present with persistent and severe nausea and vomiting, accompanied by headache, neurologic deficits, and abnormal cognition. Signs and symptoms include disorientation, confusion, loss of balance, and seizures. Physical examination may show papilledema, ataxia, and reduced or absent deep tendon and corneal reflexes.</p><p/><p>There may be a latent period of a few hours during which there is apparent improvement, but within five to six hours, watery diarrhea secondary to severe gastrointestinal syndrome, respiratory distress, fever, and cardiovascular collapse ensue. The final picture, which may mimic that of sepsis, includes hypotension, cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, and cerebral anoxia, with death within a few days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gastrointestinal syndrome of ARS typically develops within five days of the initial exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70498\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70498 \">table 5</a>). At doses &lt;1.5 Gy, only the prodromal phase of nausea, vomiting, and gastric atony are observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p>More severe symptoms develop at doses between 5 and 12 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>], secondary to loss of intestinal crypt cells and breakdown of the mucosal barrier, with sloughing of the epithelial cell layer and denudation of the bowel wall. These changes result in crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding with resultant anemia, and abnormalities of fluid and electrolyte balance. This early phase is often followed by a latent phase lasting five to seven days, during which symptoms abate. Vomiting and severe diarrhea accompanied by high fever characterize the manifest illness phase. Systemic effects at this time may include malnutrition from malabsorption.</p><p>Impaired barrier function of the gastrointestinal tract results in the translocation of bacteria and their toxins through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream, predisposing to infection and sepsis. The combination of an impaired mucosal barrier and immunosuppression from the hematopoietic syndrome predisposes to sepsis and can result in a fatal outcome. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>Other severe complications include ulceration and necrosis of the bowel wall, leading to stenosis, ileus, and perforation. In the latter case, recovery is unlikely, as radiosensitive stem cells in the crypts of the gastrointestinal tract are permanently damaged. Consequently, there is no replacement of cells that are lost from the surface of the villi through the sloughing process, precluding recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/43,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,105</a>].</p><p>However, mild gastrointestinal symptoms limited to one or two episodes of diarrhea with associated abdominal pain are accompanied by virtually certain recovery, provided that the hematopoietic syndrome that follows is reversible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Hematopoietic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hematopoietic syndrome of ARS develops at doses exceeding 1 Gy and is clinically insignificant at doses of &lt;1 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/3,98,99,102,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,98,99,102,104</a>].</p><p>Mitotically active hematopoietic precursors have a limited capacity to divide after whole-body doses greater than 2 to 3 Gy. In addition to inducing apoptosis, which is not seen before the first cell cycle following exposure, radiation alters recirculation properties of lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/72,92,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,92,106</a>]. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia may develop, reaching a nadir at two to four weeks after exposure to 3 to 4 Gy, and may persist for months. Anemia inevitably ensues due to the combined effects of gastrointestinal blood loss from the gastrointestinal syndrome and hemorrhage into organs and tissues secondary to thrombocytopenia.</p><p>Bone marrow hypoplasia and aplasia may develop at doses of &gt;5 to 7 Gy, resulting in severe pancytopenia over weeks to months. This development predisposes to infection, bleeding, and poor wound healing, all of which may contribute to death in the absence of appropriate supportive care, including cytokines, transfusion of blood products and, in some cases, hematopoietic cell transplantation.</p><p>Two important points warrant discussion here:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhomogeneity of dose, afforded by partial shielding or a more ventral exposure may imply bone marrow sparing. Indeed, over 60 percent of active bone marrow is present dorsally in the spine, dorsal ribs, and pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].

In addition, radiation is known to cause endothelial cell damage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> death, resulting in interruption of the marrow-peripheral blood barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>Based on the overall levels of lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, as well as the presence or absence of infection and blood loss, the relative severity of toxicity to the hematopoietic system can be evaluated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51611\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51611 \">table 6</a>). Approaches to therapy for different levels of severity, including the use of transfusions, antibiotics, colony-stimulating factors, and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, are described separately.

However, it may take many years before becoming fully manifest. Unlike the syndromes discussed above, which are related to the whole body radiation dose, the localized dose to the skin is critical for determining the type of skin lesions that occur.</p><p>Early lesions include erythema, edema, and dry desquamation of the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62805 \">table 7</a>). Such lesions may be isolated, or they may appear simultaneously in several locations depending on the amount of skin receiving direct exposure. More advanced lesions include bullae, moist desquamation, ulceration, and onycholysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/114,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,115</a>].</p><p>Target cells of radiation reside at multiple levels within the skin (ie, epidermis, dermis, hair follicle canals, subcutaneous tissues). Hence, the severity of the cutaneous reaction depends upon the depth dose distribution of the radiation source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Ulceration may be limited to the epidermis or may involve deeper structures, such as the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, and even muscle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone.
