AKI is an important contributing factor to the morbidity and mortality of critically ill neonates.</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation, management, and prognosis of neonatal AKI are presented in this topic review.

The choice of modality is influenced by the clinical presentation and potential for recovery, the presence or absence of multisystem failure, the indication for RRT, and the availability of staff and appropriate equipment for the neonatal patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-evaluation-management-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Peritoneal dialysis can be initiated immediately after the dialysis catheter is placed and can be performed as soon as three days after major abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-evaluation-management-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It is less efficient in altering blood solute composition and in fluid removal than the other modalities, but it can be applied continuously and is therefore well tolerated by hemodynamically unstable patients. Unlike hemodialysis and hemofiltration, systemic heparinization is not required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Morbidity and mortality are high in newborns undergoing peritoneal dialysis and are related to the infant's underlying diagnosis and clinical condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-evaluation-management-and-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Complications include peritonitis, obstruction of the dialysis catheter, leaking dialysate, and inguinal or umbilical hernias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis offers a rapid change in plasma solute composition and rapid removal of excessive body water. However, this may not be tolerated by hemodynamically unstable patients and is technically challenging in newborns. Most centers do not have staff and equipment to perform hemodialysis in the neonate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHD) is increasing in newborns. Compared with peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, CVVHD allows more precise fluid and metabolic control, decreases hemodynamic instability, and, in patients with sepsis or multiorgan system failure, enhances the removal of cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-evaluation-management-and-prognosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3433458557\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKI increases the risk of mortality and morbidity for neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neonatal-acute-kidney-injury-evaluation-management-and-prognosis/abstract/10,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,31</a>].

Elements of the evaluation include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Directed history to uncover an obvious risk factor or cause for neonatal AKI. This includes reviewing the results of a prenatal ultrasound if available, and a history for nephrotoxic exposure, perinatal asphyxia, or hypovolemia. (See <a href=\"#H3669416206\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Key features of the physical examination that may be associated with AKI include edema, elevated pressure, palpable kidneys suggesting enlargement, distended bladder, and other nonrenal anomalies associated with AKI (eg, critical congenital heart disease). Excessive weight loss is suggestive of hypovolemia and prerenal AKI, whereas excessive weight gain suggests impairment of water excretion seen in patients with intrinsic and postrenal disease. (See <a href=\"#H1454056729\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A renal ultrasound documents the presence of one or two kidneys, the shape and size of the kidney(s), and detects congenital anomalies or vascular abnormalities. In particular, severe bilateral hydronephrosis or severe unilateral hydronephrosis in a solitary kidney is suggestive of postrenal disease due to obstructive uropathy. A renal ultrasound will also identify patients with chronic congenital disease (eg, cystic renal disease, renal hypodysplasia) who present in a similar manner to neonates with AKI. (See <a href=\"#H4140351884\" class=\"local\">'Renal ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Administration of a fluid challenge can identify patients with prerenal disease due to hypovolemia.
