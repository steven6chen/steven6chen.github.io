Anesthesiologists are additionally concerned with understanding the impact of the neurologic disorder on anesthetic management, as well as minimizing perioperative physiologic changes that can impact the neurologic disorder and lead to an adverse perioperative event. The more commonly encountered neurologic disorders and their perioperative management are reviewed here.</p><p>Perioperative management of patients with traumatic brain injury, patients who undergo craniotomy and spine surgery, and patients with spinal cord injury are discussed separately.

Most patients with epilepsy are managed with antiseizure drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>People with epilepsy appear to be at significant risk of postoperative complications, some of which are attributed to epilepsy and some to comorbidities associated with epilepsy. In one retrospective database study, 13,103 patients with epilepsy had a higher rate of postoperative complications compared with those without epilepsy (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.92-2.14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Stroke was identified as the most significant postoperative complication in patients with epilepsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes of seizures in perioperative patients</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epilepsy</strong> &ndash; Patients with epilepsy may have a breakthrough seizure in the perioperative setting. In one retrospective review, 22 (3.4 percent) of 641 patients with epilepsy experienced a perioperative seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The most prominent risk factors for perioperative seizure were related to poor seizure control prior to surgery: frequency of preoperative seizure and timing of most recent seizure. A lower seizure threshold and increase in risk for perioperative seizure in patients with epilepsy may be related to subtherapeutic drug levels or sleep deprivation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anesthesia</strong> &ndash; Several anesthetic sedative-hypnotic drugs have both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant effects, which can depend on dose and physiologic situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. In many instances, the putative proconvulsant effect of an anesthetic is evidenced only by an association with epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> myoclonic activity during induction or emergence. Overt seizures caused by general anesthetic drugs are rare; most sedative-hypnotic drugs have been used to treat status epilepticus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The incidence of general anesthesia-related seizures is unknown, but is more likely in patients with epilepsy than in patients without this predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. In one series of 297 patients with epilepsy undergoing anesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging study, 2 percent of patients had a seizure that was temporally associated with the administration of an anesthetic agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other causes of anesthesia-related seizures include local anesthetic systemic toxicity and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> in large doses or administered to patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=local-anesthetic-systemic-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Local anesthetic systemic toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolic and systemic derangements</strong> &ndash; Most patients who have perioperative seizures in the absence of underlying epilepsy have a metabolic derangement. As examples, hyponatremia may occur following transurethral surgery, and hypocalcemia is seen after thyroid or parathyroid surgery. In addition, acute organ failure from any cause and rapidly developing malignant hyperthermia may cause seizures. Sepsis can cause seizures and should be considered in any trauma patient with an obvious source of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug and alcohol withdrawal</strong> &ndash; Seizures can occur following withdrawal from any sedative-hypnotic medication; alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal are common precipitants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, a toxicology screen is warranted in patients who suffer postoperative seizures without a history of previous seizure disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alcohol withdrawal seizures are predominantly seen in patients with a long history of chronic alcoholism. They are characteristically generalized tonic-clonic convulsions that occur within 48 hours after the last drink; they may occur after only two hours of abstinence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, alcohol withdrawal does not preclude another cause for seizure. Such patients may benefit from further investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;, section on 'Acute symptomatic seizures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intracranial and cerebrovascular surgery</strong> &ndash; The incidence of seizures following intracranial surgery depends upon the underlying pathologic conditions, location, and the degree of brain retraction required to perform the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The incidence of postoperative seizures is approximately 25 percent in surgical procedures requiring extensive retraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrovascular disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Others</strong> &ndash; Other causes of seizures are discussed in detail separately.

In this regard, a side effect of general anesthesia should not be assumed and if another etiology is not identified (local anesthetic toxicity, drug or alcohol withdrawal, intracranial surgery), then metabolic derangements and acute neurologic injury should be investigated. Patients with seizures postoperatively should be screened for electrolyte abnormalities as guided by the operative procedure and the preoperative laboratory values.</p><p>The evaluation of a patient with a new-onset seizure is described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute seizure management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because major motor seizures that occur during or immediately after a surgical procedure can increase morbidity and mortality, an antiseizure medication is typically administered for a breakthrough or acute symptomatic seizure that occurs in the operating room or immediate postoperative period. Underlying metabolic disturbances should be quickly identified and treated. Patients with seizures that occur as a result of a reversible cause (metabolic disturbance, alcohol withdrawal) do not require long-term antiseizure drugs.</p><p>Commonly used drugs in this setting include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosphenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a>, and valproic acid. For patients taking one of these medications preoperatively, it seems reasonable to administer a bolus of that agent; otherwise, the choice is based upon physician experience or preference. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> is readily available and is often used by anesthesiologists in the operating and recovery rooms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fosphenytoin</a> sodium is a water-soluble prodrug of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> that can be administered intravenously and intramuscularly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In a Danish nationwide cohort study, the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality) and all-cause mortality up to 30 days after surgery was significantly higher in patients with a history of recent stroke compared with patients without this history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

As an example, one study of 224 patients with carotid stenosis documented by carotid ultrasound prior to general surgery reported a perioperative stroke risk of 3.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This risk is similar to the risk of stroke associated with carotid endarterectomy.

The cardiac death rate is approximately 5 percent per year for patients with asymptomatic carotid bruits, TIAs, or stroke. Thirty-five percent of patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease or symptomatic carotid bruits have coronary artery disease that may be inoperable or warrant myocardial revascularization, and many of these patients do not have cardiac symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perioperative-care-of-the-surgical-patient-with-neurologic-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Thus, the presence of known carotid artery disease or a carotid bruit should be a signal that the patient may have coexisting coronary heart disease. The best approach for identifying coronary heart disease in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease needs further evaluation.
