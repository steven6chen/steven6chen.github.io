Some have symptoms that are directly referable to the kidney (gross hematuria, flank pain) or to extrarenal symptoms (edema, hypertension, signs of uremia). Many patients, however, are asymptomatic and are noted on routine examination to have an elevated serum creatinine concentration or an abnormal urinalysis.</p><p>Once kidney disease is discovered, the presence or degree of kidney dysfunction and rapidity of progression are assessed, and the underlying disorder is diagnosed. Although the history and physical examination can be helpful, the most useful information is initially obtained from estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and examination of the urinary sediment.</p><p>Estimation of the GFR is used clinically to assess the degree of kidney impairment and to follow the course of the disease. However, the GFR provides no information on the cause of the kidney disease. This is achieved by the urinalysis, measurement of urinary protein excretion, and, if necessary, radiologic studies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> kidney biopsy.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the issues concerning assessment of the GFR in the patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The utility of the urinalysis, radiologic studies, and kidney biopsy are discussed separately, as is the general approach to the patient with kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic assessment of renal disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for and complications of renal biopsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF KIDNEY FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to discussing the evaluation of kidney function, it is helpful to first briefly review normal kidney physiology. The kidney performs a number of essential processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It participates in the maintenance of the constant extracellular environment that is required for adequate functioning of the cells. This is achieved by excretion of some of the waste products of metabolism (such as urea, creatinine, and uric acid) and by specifically adjusting the urinary excretion of water and electrolytes to match net intake and endogenous production (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57561\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57561 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62415\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62415 \">table 2</a>). The kidney is able to regulate individually the excretion of water and solutes such as sodium, potassium, and hydrogen, largely by changes in tubular reabsorption or secretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It secretes hormones that participate in the regulation of systemic and renal hemodynamics (renin, prostaglandins, and bradykinin), red blood cell production (erythropoietin), and calcium, phosphorus, and bone metabolism (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or calcitriol).</p><p/><p>In the patient with kidney disease, some or all of these functions may be diminished or entirely absent. As an example, patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus have a decreased urinary concentrating ability, but other functions are entirely normal. By comparison, all kidney functions may be significantly impaired in the patient with end-stage renal disease, thereby resulting in the retention of uremic toxins, marked abnormalities in fluid and electrolyte balance, and anemia and bone disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal GFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is equal to the sum of the filtration rates in all of the functioning nephrons; thus, the GFR gives a rough measure of the number of functioning nephrons. The filtering units of the kidney, the glomeruli, filter approximately 180 liters per day (125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> of plasma. The normal value for GFR depends upon age, sex, and body size, and is approximately 130 and 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> for men and women, respectively, with considerable variation even among normal individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20658680\"><span class=\"h2\">Significance of a declining GFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with kidney disease, a reduction in GFR implies either progression of the underlying disease or the development of a superimposed and often reversible problem, such as decreased renal perfusion due to volume depletion. In addition, the level of GFR has prognostic implications in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and such patients are staged, in part, according to GFR. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, there is <strong>not</strong> an exact correlation between the loss of kidney mass (ie, nephron loss) and the loss of GFR. The kidney adapts to the loss of some nephrons by compensatory hyperfiltration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increasing solute and water reabsorption in the remaining, normal nephrons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Thus, an individual who has lost one-half of total kidney mass will not necessarily have one-half the normal amount of GFR. (See <a href=\"#H20664189\" class=\"local\">'Using creatinine to estimate GFR'</a> below.)</p><p>These concepts have important consequences:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stable GFR does not necessarily imply stable disease. Signs of disease progression other than a change in GFR must be investigated, including increased activity of the urine sediment, a rise in protein excretion, or an elevation in blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, an increase in GFR may indicate improvement in the kidney disease or may imply a counterproductive increase in filtration (hyperfiltration) due to hemodynamic factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients who have true underlying renal disease may go unrecognized because they have a normal GFR.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20658806\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT OF GFR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20658260\"><span class=\"h2\">How to evaluate GFR: Measurement versus estimation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is complex, time consuming, and cumbersome to do in clinical practice. As such, GFR is usually estimated from serum markers (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Estimation of GFR'</a> below). Clinical situations in which it is important to have more precise knowledge of the GFR include: prior to dose adjustment of medications, especially toxic medications with narrow therapeutic indices, such as chemotherapy; prior to kidney donation; and prior to determining the need for preemptive transplant. In such circumstances, it would be reasonable to consider measuring GFR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Measurement of GFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although GFR cannot be measured directly, the best method for determining GFR is measurement of the urinary clearance of an ideal filtration marker. Using a filtration marker (x), the equation to calculate the clearance of x (Cx) is:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Equation 1: &#160; &#160; &#160;Cx = (Ux &#160;x &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">V)/Px</span></p></div></div><p>Where Px is the serum concentration of the marker, Ux is the urinary concentration of x, and V is the urine flow rate.</p><p>An ideal filtration marker is defined as a solute that is freely filtered at the glomerulus, nontoxic, neither secreted nor reabsorbed by the kidney tubules, and not changed during its excretion by the kidney. If these criteria are met, the filtered load is equal to the rate of urinary excretion:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Equation 2: &#160; &#160; &#160;GFR x &#160;Px = (Ux &#160;x &#160;V)</p></div></div><p>Where GFR X Px is the filtered load, and Ux X V is the urinary excretion rate. By substitution into Equation 1:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Equation 3: &#160; &#160; &#160;GFR = Cx</p></div></div><p>Plasma clearance is an alternative to urinary clearance for measurement of GFR. It is performed by timed plasma measurements after administering a bolus intravenous injection of an exogenous filtration marker; the clearance equation is:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Equation 4: Cx = Ax &divide; Px</p></div></div><p>Where Ax is the amount of the marker administered, and Px is the plasma concentration computed from the entire area under the disappearance curve.</p><p>The gold standard of exogenous filtration markers is inulin. Inulin is a physiologically inert substance that is freely filtered at the glomerulus, and is neither secreted, reabsorbed, synthesized, nor metabolized by the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, the amount of inulin filtered at the glomerulus is equal to the amount excreted in the urine, which can be measured. Inulin, however, is in short supply (and is no longer available in the United States), expensive, and difficult to assay. In addition, the classic protocol for measuring inulin clearance requires a continuous intravenous infusion, multiple blood samples, and bladder catheterization.</p><p>Various less cumbersome methods for measuring clearance are available: using alternative filtration markers (such as radioactive or nonradioactive iothalamate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iohexol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iohexol</a>, DTPA, or EDTA), bolus administration of the marker (subcutaneous or intravenous), spontaneous bladder emptying, and plasma clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. While these methods are simpler, all have disadvantages that limit their application in clinical practice and affect the interpretation of research studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimation of GFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the most common methods utilized to estimate the GFR are: measurement of the creatinine clearance; and estimation equations based upon serum creatinine such as the Cockcroft-Gault equation, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equation, and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. The abbreviated MDRD study and CKD-EPI equations are being increasingly utilized. (See <a href=\"#H20663240\" class=\"local\">'Creatinine clearance'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20659769\" class=\"local\">'Estimation equations'</a> below.)</p><p>Both measurement of the creatinine clearance and estimation equations rely upon creatinine as a marker of kidney function. Issues related to the use of creatinine to estimate GFR are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H20664189\" class=\"local\">'Using creatinine to estimate GFR'</a> below.)</p><p>Other markers of kidney function include the blood urea nitrogen (BUN), which is less useful than the serum creatinine, and serum cystatin C. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'BUN and GFR'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Serum cystatin C'</a> below.)</p><p>The reciprocal of the serum creatinine concentration to assess changes in GFR over time is discussed separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4013627383\"><span class=\"h3\">Requirement for stable kidney function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endogenous filtration markers can only be used to estimate GFR in individuals with stable kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Early in the course of acute kidney injury, for example, the GFR is markedly reduced, but there has not yet been time for the filtration marker to accumulate and, therefore, for the filtration marker to reflect the degree of kidney disease severity. An equation has been developed that estimates the true GFR given the rate of change in creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20664189\"><span class=\"h3\">Using creatinine to estimate GFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creatinine is derived from the metabolism of creatine in skeletal muscle and from dietary meat intake. It is released into the circulation at a relatively constant rate. Creatinine is freely filtered across the glomerulus and is neither reabsorbed nor metabolized by the kidney. However, approximately 10 to 40 percent of urinary creatinine is derived from tubular secretion by the organic cation secretory pathways in the proximal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, if GFR, creatinine secretion by the renal tubules, creatine intake (ie, diet), and the creatinine pool size (ie, muscle mass) all remain constant, then the plasma creatinine concentration should remain constant. </p><p>Creatinine excretion (GFR &#160;x &#160;SCr), where SCr is serum creatinine, equals creatinine production in the steady state and creatinine production is relatively constant on a stable diet and with stable muscle mass. As a result:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;GFR &#160;x &#160;SCr &#160; = &#160; constant</p></div></div><p>Thus, the serum creatinine concentration varies inversely with the GFR. If, for example, the GFR falls by 50 percent, creatinine excretion will initially be reduced. Assuming that tubular creatinine secretion, diet, and muscle mass do not change, this reduction in GFR will lead to creatinine retention and a rise in the serum creatinine until it has doubled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59518 \">figure 1</a>); at this point, the filtered load will again be equal to excretion:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">GFR/2</span> &#160;x &#160;2SCr &#160; &#160;= &#160; &#160;GFR &#160;x &#160;SCr &#160; &#160;= &#160; &#160;constant</p></div></div><p>The shape of the curve relating the GFR to serum creatinine has an important clinical implication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59518 \">figure 1</a>): in patients with mild kidney disease, a small rise in serum creatinine usually reflects a marked fall in GFR, whereas a marked rise in serum creatinine in patients with advanced disease reflects a small absolute reduction in GFR. </p><p>However, this curve depicts a hypothetical relationship between GFR and serum creatinine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59518 \">figure 1</a>). In reality, a reduction in GFR results in increased tubular creatinine secretion that blunts the rise in serum creatinine. Thus, a 50 percent reduction in GFR does not produce a doubling of serum creatinine, but rather a smaller rise than would have occurred if the decrease in GFR had occurred without an increase in secretion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1505493\"><span class=\"h4\">Normal values</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the United States, the mean serum creatinine values for men and women were 1.13 and 0.93 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (100 and 82 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76830\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76830 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The mean values also varied by race. For non-Hispanic blacks, the mean serum creatinine was 1.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in men and 1.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in women. The values were lower in non-Hispanic whites (1.16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in men and 0.97 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in women) and in Mexican-Americans (1.07 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in men and 0.86 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The mean values will all be lower with the adoption of newer creatinine assays traceable to reference materials. </p><p>Serum creatinine values are lower in women because they have less muscle mass and, therefore, a lower rate of creatinine excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. It is presumed that the higher values for blacks and lower values for Hispanics similarly reflect greater and lesser, respectively, muscle mass and creatinine excretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20665137\"><span class=\"h4\">Limitations of using creatinine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several key limitations of using creatinine to estimate GFR. These include variations in creatinine production, variations in creatinine secretion, extrarenal creatinine excretion, and issues associated with creatinine measurement. </p><p>With stable kidney function, as seen in patients with normal kidney function or chronic kidney disease (CKD), a rise in serum creatinine almost always represents a reduction in GFR. However, certain drugs can interfere with either creatinine secretion or the assay used to measure the serum creatinine, and dietary changes or dietary supplements can alter creatinine production. In these settings, there will be no change in GFR and no concurrent elevation in the BUN. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs that elevate the serum creatinine concentration&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1505177\"><span class=\"h5\">Variation in creatinine production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The production of creatinine differs among and within people over time. As examples, individuals with significant variations in dietary intake (vegetarian diet, creatine supplements) or reduction in muscle mass (amputation, malnutrition, muscle wasting) produce different amounts of creatinine than the general population. The accuracy of estimation equations is affected to a greater extent among lower extremity amputees, given the much greater reduction in muscle mass, compared with upper extremity amputations. </p><p>There are certain settings in which there may be an acute increase in creatinine load. One example is a recent meat meal. In addition, it has been suggested that the serum creatinine rises more rapidly with rhabdomyolysis (up to 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 220 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> per day) than with other causes of acute kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Release of preformed creatinine from injured muscle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> release of creatine phosphate that is then converted into creatinine in the extracellular fluid have been proposed as explanations for this finding. However, neither of these mechanisms appears to account for most of the increase in the serum creatinine concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. An alternative explanation is that rhabdomyolysis often affects otherwise healthy men with a high muscle mass and a higher rate of creatinine production while other forms of acute kidney injury frequently affect patients who are chronically ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1505184\"><span class=\"h5\">Variation in creatinine secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The accuracy of GFR estimation with both the creatinine clearance and creatinine-based estimation equations is limited by the fact that as the GFR falls, the rise in the serum creatinine is partially opposed by enhanced proximal tubular creatinine secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/2,3,6,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6,17,18</a>]. In early renal disease when the GFR is still near normal, an initial decline in GFR may lead to only a slight increase (0.1 to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [9 to 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> in the serum creatinine. The net effect is that patients with a true GFR as low as 60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (as measured by the clearance of a true filtration marker such as inulin or radioisotopic iothalamate or DTPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/6,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19,20</a>]) may still have a serum creatinine that is &le;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, a relatively stable serum creatinine in the normal or near-normal range does <strong>not</strong> necessarily imply that the disease is stable. </p><p>However, once the serum creatinine exceeds 1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (132 to 176 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> the secretory process is effectively saturated. After this, a stable value usually represents a stable GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The following clinical examples are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A man with unrecognized kidney disease and an initial serum creatinine of 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (79.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> has a decline in his true GFR from 120 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (loss of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, or approximately 40 percent of his GFR). Using the hypothetical relationship between GFR and creatinine (which ignores creatinine secretion), the serum creatinine multiplied by GFR is a constant, and the serum creatinine would be expected to rise to approximately 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (150.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59518 \">figure 1</a>). However, his actual rise in serum creatinine is much smaller, to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (106.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> because of increased creatinine secretion. Although a serum creatinine of 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is in the normal range, this should <strong>not</strong> be mistakenly assumed to be normal or indicative of only mild disease. The severity of the GFR decline was not apparent due to an increase in creatinine secretion. Early detection of progressive kidney disease is particularly important because of the availability of therapies, particularly blood pressure lowering with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which can slow the rate of progression in many patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another patient with more advanced disease, the serum creatinine is 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (354 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and the GFR 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Because creatinine secretion is saturated, a rise in serum creatinine (SCr) to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (530 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> reflects a GFR of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> or a loss of only 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Assuming that generation and extrarenal elimination of creatinine in this patient are constant, then GFR &#160;x &#160;SCr is constant, so: GFR &#160;x &#160;SCr &#160;= &#160;15 &#160;x &#160;4 &#160;= &#160;10 &#160;x &#160;6 &#160;= &#160;60.</p><p/><p>In addition, creatinine secretion may be enhanced or inhibited in certain clinical situations. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubular creatinine secretion is significantly increased in patients with the nephrotic syndrome. In one study, in which GFR was determined by inulin clearance, decreased serum albumin levels were associated with a marked increase in tubular creatinine secretion (36 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> for nephrotic patients with serum albumin levels less than 2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> versus 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> for normal controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with sickle cell disease may also have an increase in creatinine secretion.

In a study evaluating over 5000 laboratories using 20 different instruments to measure serum creatinine by up to three different methods (alkaline picrate and enzymatic), the mean serum creatinine concentration on a standardized sample ranged from 0.84 to 1.21 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (74.3 to 107 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

From the ages of 50 to 90 years, there is a progressive 50 percent decline in creatinine excretion (to about 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in men), due primarily to a fall in muscle mass. Formulas that incorporate race and weight with or without serum phosphorus in addition to age and sex may improve the estimation of creatinine excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/13,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,30</a>]: </p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Estimated creatinine excretion <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/day)</span> = 1115.89 + (11.97 x weight in kg) &ndash; (5.83 x age) &minus; (60.18 x phosphorus in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> + (52.82 if black) &ndash; (368.75 if female)</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, suppose a 50 year-old white woman weighing 50 kg excreted 1200 mg (10,600 micromol) of creatinine in 24 hours (24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg])</span>. According to the simple rule based upon age and sex alone, this patient provided an accurate collection.

In addition, repeating the creatinine clearance and averaging the two would minimize the effect of any error.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, variability in urine collections can lead to the following frequent misinterpretation. The 24-hour creatinine clearance is measured on two separate occasions in a patient with known kidney disease and a stable weight and diet. The serum creatinine is unchanged but the creatinine clearance has declined by 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. The latter finding suggests that kidney function has deteriorated. However, if the serum creatinine concentration is stable, then from the formula for creatinine clearance ([UCr &#160;x &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">V]/SCr),</span> the only way for the measured creatinine clearance to fall is if creatinine excretion (UCr &#160;x &#160;V) has fallen. Assuming constant muscle mass and diet, the most likely explanation for reduced creatinine excretion is an incomplete urine collection. It is therefore likely that the stable serum creatinine in this patient represents a stable creatinine clearance (which, as described below, may or may not represent a constant GFR because of changes in creatinine secretion). Similar considerations apply to a rise in creatinine clearance without change in the serum creatinine. In this setting, an over collection increasing apparent daily creatinine excretion is most probable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing creatinine secretion &ndash; The increase in creatinine secretion as GFR falls can limit the interpretation of the creatinine clearance. (See <a href=\"#H1505184\" class=\"local\">'Variation in creatinine secretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, if the true GFR falls to a range of 40 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (as measured by an exogenous filtration marker), and the absolute amount of creatinine secreted rises by more than 50 percent, creatinine secretion would now account for as much as 35 percent of urinary creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, in some patients with CKD, creatinine excretion may be much greater than the filtered load, resulting in a potentially large overestimation of the GFR when creatinine clearance is used to assess the level of GFR. The net effect is that the creatinine clearance may be normal (&gt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> in about one-half of patients with a true GFR of 61 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and one-quarter of those with a true GFR of 51 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some patients with advanced disease have a creatinine clearance that exceeds the GFR by more than twofold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This was best shown in a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven studies of 193 patients with liver cirrhosis in which the measured creatinine clearance was compared with true GFR (assessed by inulin clearance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Overall, the measured creatinine clearance overestimated inulin clearance by a mean of 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, with the overestimation being highest in those with the lowest true GFRs. Among those with inulin clearance of less than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (true stage 4 to 5 CKD), the measured creatinine clearance correctly classified 64 percent of patients, incorrectly classified 23 percent of patients as having GFRs between 30 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and incorrectly classified 14 percent as having GFRs &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Another method to help estimate the GFR in these patients is to average both the creatinine and urea clearances </p><p/><p>From the above considerations, all that can be concluded is that the creatinine clearance represents an upper limit of what the true GFR may be. An alternative, although not widely used clinically, is to competitively inhibit creatinine secretion by the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cimetidine</a>, which is secreted by the same pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

This is particularly true when there are variations in creatinine production. Given these variations, all serum creatinine equations will be less accurate in certain populations. These include diabetic patients with high GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>], specific ethnic groups (eg, Asians), pregnant women, and those with unusual muscle mass, body habitus, and weight (eg, morbid obesity, amputees). In all of these settings, use of a confirmatory test such as estimated GFR from cystatin C or creatinine-cystatin GFR estimating equations (see below), collection of a 24-hour urine sample for measurement of creatinine clearance, or measurement of clearance of an exogenous filtration marker will provide a more accurate assessment of GFR than estimated GFR from creatinine. (See <a href=\"#H1505177\" class=\"local\">'Variation in creatinine production'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20659832\"><span class=\"h4\">Drug dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug dosing guidelines have historically been developed using the Cockcroft-Gault equation to estimate kidney function. This practice is consistent with the recommendation of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to pharmaceutical industries to use an estimating equation, rather than serum creatinine alone, in pharmacokinetic studies to determine drug dosing in kidney disease. Most pharmacokinetic studies for drug dosing in renal disease were performed using the Cockcroft-Gault equation since this equation was suggested by the FDA prior to publication of the MDRD study equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. </p><p>The move toward standardizing all creatinine assays so that they are traceable to reference materials creates a problem with drug dosing according to estimated GFR. The pharmacokinetic studies were performed using serum creatinine values that were highly variable (before standardized reference materials were available), and therefore the results of these pharmacokinetic studies <strong>cannot</strong> necessarily be reliably translated into current clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. This could lead to inaccuracies in drug dosing in patients with kidney disease.</p><p>However, a large simulation study showed that there was greater concordance between the MDRD study equation and measured GFR than the Cockcroft-Gault equation and measured GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Concordance was lower for the Cockcroft-Gault equation at older age but was consistent for the MDRD study equation. Unpublished data show comparability between the MDRD study equation and the CKD-EPI equation. Thus, for most patients, the MDRD study or CKD-EPI equation can be used to estimate kidney function for drug dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Given these and other data, the<strong> </strong>Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2011 clinical update on drug dosing in patients with acute and chronic kidney diseases recommended using the most accurate method for GFR evaluation for each patient (rather than limiting the evaluation to the Cockcroft-Gault formula) and specifically including estimated GFR as it is reported by clinical laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>If estimated GFR is used for drug dosing in very large or small patients, the reported estimated GFR (which is normalized to body surface area) should be multiplied by the estimated body surface area and then divided by 1.73 to obtain an estimated GFR in units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (ie, not normalized to body surface area). </p><p>As noted above, for patients at the extremes of muscle mass, with unusual diets, or with conditions associated with changes in creatinine secretion, all estimation equations that use the serum creatinine are limited. In such cases, dosing decisions should be made based upon GFR estimated with cystatin- or creatinine-cystatin-based equations, with measured creatinine clearance, or with measured GFR using exogenous filtration markers, particularly if prescribing drugs with a narrow therapeutic window. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of GFR'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20663240\" class=\"local\">'Creatinine clearance'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">BUN and GFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) also varies inversely with the GFR, it is generally less useful than the serum creatinine because the BUN can change independently of the GFR. Two factors contribute to this phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/6,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,93</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of urea production is not constant, increasing with a high-protein diet and with enhanced tissue breakdown due to hemorrhage, trauma, or glucocorticoid therapy. By comparison, a low-protein diet or liver disease can lower the BUN without change in GFR. Thus, liver disease may be associated with near-normal values for both the BUN (due to decreased urea production) and the serum creatinine (due to muscle wasting) despite a relatively large reduction in GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of kidney disease in this setting can be documented by a reduction in creatinine clearance, but significant overestimation of GFR can still occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/31,47,95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,47,95,96</a>].

Thus, when volume depletion is associated with enhanced proximal sodium and water reabsorption, there is a parallel increase in urea reabsorption. As a result, the BUN will rise out of proportion to any change in GFR, and therefore to any change in the serum creatinine (SCr). This elevation in the BUN-to-SCr ratio is one of the suggestive clinical signs of decreased renal perfusion (prerenal disease) as the cause for renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The measurement of the clearance of urea is useful in one setting. Among patients with severe kidney disease (eg, a serum creatinine greater than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [220 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> the urea clearance significantly underestimates the GFR. Since the creatinine clearance significantly overestimates this function, one method to estimate the GFR in patients with advanced renal disease is to average both the creatinine and urea clearances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; CCr &#160;+ &#160;CUrea<br/> &#160; &#160; Estimated &#160;GFR &#160; &#160;= &#160; &#160;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 2</p></div></div><p>The 2005 European Best Practices Guidelines suggest that this calculation is preferred for estimating GFR in advanced kidney failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].

Cystatin C is filtered at the glomerulus and not reabsorbed. However, it is metabolized in the tubules, which prevents use of cystatin C to directly measure clearance. Cystatin C is believed to be produced by all nucleated cells. Its rate of production has been thought to be relatively constant, and not affected by changes in diet, although this is not proven.

Since these data were not adjusted for GFR, it is unclear whether they are related to different levels of kidney function among the populations or differences in the non-GFR determinants of cystatin C. Together, these data suggest that levels of cystatin C are affected by many factors other than GFR.</p><p>As with creatinine, substantial variation in the cystatin C assay has been observed, even when using the same instrument and the same reagent type by the same laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. In addition, substantial declines in cystatin C levels over time have been observed with a popular reagent and method.

However, the results from studies comparing creatinine- and cystatin C-based estimates in these populations have shown variable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. As an example, whether cystatin C correlates better with GFR than serum creatinine in patients with diabetic nephropathy is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/128,129\" class=\"abstract_t\">128,129</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, steroid use may affect cystatin C levels, therefore limiting its use in transplant recipients. In one study, for example, for the same level of cystatin C, measured GFR was 19 percent higher in transplant recipients than in patients with native kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although cystatin C appears to be more accurate for the assessment of GFR than serum creatinine in certain populations, whether measurement of cystatin C levels will improve patient care is at present unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. For this reason, GFR estimated based upon cystatin C is recommended as a confirmatory test. However, it is reasonable to use cystatin C-based estimated GFR in patients with clear reductions muscle mass. In support of this concept, in a study of other healthy amputees, estimation based upon cystatin C was substantially more accurate than estimation based upon creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-kidney-function/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculator&amp;token=tFEE5CwYOx1Y3D/TVtbtFRoZQH9xu63YY49fcYTyh5Kpuc4eU7HWlWwVb1UVYYXXAklO1h2yRwb7HUx7xg1Ttw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2359\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Estimated GFR</a> based upon both cystatin C and creatinine can be used for confirmation of the diagnosis of CKD in patients with an estimated GFR of 45 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> and no other evidence of kidney disease, such as albuminuria or radiologic abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney donor evaluation &ndash; In the United States, performance of a clearance measurement (24-hour urine for creatinine clearance or urinary or plasma clearance off exogenous filtration markers) is required for GFR evaluation.

GFR frequently decreases with age. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Normal GFR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with kidney disease, a reduction in GFR implies either progression of the underlying disease or the development of a superimposed and often reversible problem. In addition, the level of GFR has prognostic implications in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and such patients are staged, in part, according to GFR. However, there is <strong>not</strong> an exact correlation between the loss of kidney mass (ie, nephron loss) and the loss of GFR. The kidney adapts to the loss of some nephrons by compensatory hyperfiltration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increasing solute and water reabsorption in the remaining, normal nephrons. (See <a href=\"#H20658680\" class=\"local\">'Significance of a declining GFR'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of GFR is complex, time consuming, and cumbersome to do in clinical practice. In addition, exact knowledge of the GFR is not required for most clinical settings. As such, GFR is usually estimated from serum markers. However, it is occasionally important to have more precise knowledge of the GFR (eg, prior to kidney donation). (See <a href=\"#H20658260\" class=\"local\">'How to evaluate GFR: Measurement versus estimation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GFR is measured by determining the urinary clearance of an ideal filtration marker. Inulin is the gold standard filtration marker, but iothalamate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iohexol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iohexol</a> are less cumbersome. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of GFR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common methods utilized to estimate the GFR are: measurement of the creatinine clearance; and estimation equations based upon serum creatinine such as the Cockcroft-Gault equation, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equations, and the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Estimation of GFR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GFR-estimating equations used in practice rely upon creatinine as a marker of kidney function. Serum creatinine can only be used to estimate GFR in individuals with stable kidney function. In addition, creatinine-based estimations of the GFR are limited by variations in creatinine production, variations in creatinine secretion, extrarenal creatinine excretion, and issues associated with creatinine measurement. (See <a href=\"#H20664189\" class=\"local\">'Using creatinine to estimate GFR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of the creatinine clearance can be used to confirm estimated GFR from serum creatinine when there are variations in creatinine production. Measured creatinine clearance is limited by errors in urine collection, as well as creatinine secretion, extrarenal creatinine excretion, and issues associated with creatinine measurement. (See <a href=\"#H20664189\" class=\"local\">'Using creatinine to estimate GFR'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creatinine is freely filtered across the glomerulus and is neither reabsorbed nor metabolized by the kidney. However, approximately 10 to 40 percent of urinary creatinine is derived from tubular secretion by the organic cation secretory pathways in the proximal tubule. If the effect of secretion is ignored, then the creatinine clearance (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-creatinine-clearance-measured\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) will be equal to the GFR. However, the creatinine clearance tends to exceed the true GFR by approximately 10 to 20 percent or more since this is the fraction of urinary creatinine that is derived from tubular secretion. In addition, using the creatinine clearance to estimate GFR is limited by errors in urine collection and variation in the degree of creatinine secretion, which increases as GFR decreases. (See <a href=\"#H20663240\" class=\"local\">'Creatinine clearance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20663247\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of using creatinine clearance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common equations used in the United States are the CKD-EPI equation, the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study equations, and the Cockcroft-Gault equation. The CKD-EPI equation is more accurate than the MDRD study equation, and both are more accurate than the Cockcroft and Gault equation. The MDRD and CKD-EPI equations are normalized to body surface area. (See <a href=\"#H20659769\" class=\"local\">'Estimation equations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Cockcroft-Gault equation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-creatinine-clearance-estimate-by-cockcroft-gault-equation-in-adults-and-older-adolescents-age-18-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>) was developed prior to the use of standardized creatinine assays, and has <strong>not</strong> been revised for use with creatinine values traceable to standardized reference materials. Thus, using the Cockcroft-Gault equation with creatinine values measured by most laboratories in the United States today will result in a 10 to 40 percent <strong>overestimate</strong> of creatinine clearance.

Among patients with GFRs greater than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the CKD-EPI equation was associated with less bias, improved precision, and greater accuracy. The CKD-EPI equation results in a lower prevalence estimate of CKD and more accurate risk prediction for adverse outcomes compared with the MDRD study equation. (See <a href=\"#H20659797\" class=\"local\">'CKD-EPI equation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the data on the improved performance, especially at higher levels of GFR, we suggest using the CKD-EPI equation for the general population. (See <a href=\"#H20659818\" class=\"local\">'Choice of equation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3124645318\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of GFR in clinical practice'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the problems associated with reliance upon serum creatinine, the commonly utilized estimation equations are less accurate in certain populations. These include individuals with normal GFR, children, elderly patients, specific ethnic groups (eg, Asians), pregnant women, and those with unusual muscle mass, body habitus, and weight (eg, morbid obesity, amputees). (See <a href=\"#H20659825\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of estimation equations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the CKD-EPI equation or MDRD study equation is used for drug dosing in very large or small patients, the reported estimated GFR (which is normalized to body surface area) should be multiplied by the estimated body surface area and then divided by 1.73 to obtain an estimated GFR in units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (ie, not normalized to body surface area). For patients at the extremes of muscle mass, with unusual diets, or with conditions associated with changes in creatinine secretion, all estimation equations that use the serum creatinine are limited; thus, a measured creatinine clearance or GFR using exogenous filtration markers should be performed especially when prescribing drugs with a narrow therapeutic window. (See <a href=\"#H20659832\" class=\"local\">'Drug dosing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The measurement of the clearance of urea is useful in one setting. Among patients with severe kidney disease (eg, a serum creatinine greater than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [220 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> the urea clearance significantly underestimates the GFR. Since the creatinine clearance significantly overestimates this function, one method to estimate the GFR in patients with advanced renal disease is to average both the creatinine and urea clearances. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'BUN and GFR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystatin C in combination with creatinine is more accurate for the assessment of GFR than serum creatinine in certain populations and can be used as a confirmatory test for diagnosis of CKD and for estimation of GFR.
