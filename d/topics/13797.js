It is a serious illness, especially in young children. Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria or viruses. The most likely cause of pneumonia depends on the child's age:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children older than 5 years, pneumonia is more likely to be caused by bacteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In babies and children younger than 5 years, pneumonia is more likely to be caused by a virus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11397168\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of pneumonia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing faster than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing or pain when breathing in</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restlessness or trouble feeding (in babies)</p><p/><p>Not all children with pneumonia have the same symptoms. But if your child seems sick and has both a cough and a fever, he or she might have pneumonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11397183\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you think your child might have pneumonia, see a doctor or nurse right away. Pneumonia can be very serious in children, especially if it is not treated right away.</p><p><strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stops breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts to turn blue or very pale</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a very hard time breathing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59786 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts grunting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Looks like he or she is getting tired of having to work so hard to breathe</p><p/><p>If a doctor or nurse thinks your child might have pneumonia, he or she will do an exam and listen to your child's breathing. He or she might also take an X-ray of your child's chest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11397198\"><span class=\"h1\">How is pneumonia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the child's age, how serious the pneumonia is, and whether it is caused by bacteria or a virus. Some children who are very sick, especially young children or babies, might need to be treated in the hospital.</p><p>Pneumonia that is caused by bacteria is treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. They are available in pill or liquid form. Make sure that your child takes all of his or her antibiotics, even if he or she starts feeling better before finishing them!</p><p>Antibiotics do <strong>not</strong> help with pneumonia that is caused by a virus. But your child's doctor or nurse might try other medicines if he or she thinks they will help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11397215\"><span class=\"h1\">How soon will my child feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children who are treated with antibiotics start to feel better 2 to 3 days after they start taking the medicine. Even so, your child might still feel tired or have a cough for a few weeks or even months after being treated. It might also be a few months before he or she can breathe comfortably while exercising.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11397230\"><span class=\"h1\">How should I take care of my child at home?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Try to keep your child as comfortable as possible, and make sure that he or she gets lots of rest. You should also give your child plenty of fluids to drink. For babies and very young children, it might help to offer small amounts of fluids frequently (instead of large amounts less often).</p><p>Medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) can help relieve pain and fever. The correct dose depends on your child's weight, so ask your child's doctor how much to give.</p><p>Do <strong>not</strong> give your child medicines that quiet a cough. These medicines don't usually work well, and they can have serious side effects in children. Also, do not give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or medicines that contain aspirin to children younger than 18 years. In children, aspirin can cause a serious problem called Reye syndrome.</p><p>Call your child's doctor or nurse if your child does not seem to be getting better after 2 days. Your child might need a different type of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11397247\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to keep my child from getting pneumonia again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wash your child's hands often with soap and water. It is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infection. You can use an alcohol rub instead, but make sure the hand rub gets everywhere on your child's hands.</p><p>There are several vaccines that help to protect against pneumonia. Talk to your child's doctor or nurse about which vaccines your child should get, and when he or she should get them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11397262\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-and-rsv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bronchiolitis (and RSV) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-children-age-7-to-18-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for children age 7 to 18 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-and-rsv-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bronchiolitis (and RSV) in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fever in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-prevention-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia prevention in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
