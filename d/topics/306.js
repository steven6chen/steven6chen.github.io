The evidence supporting the benefit of beta blockers has been obtained primarily from randomized trials that included predominantly patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). There have been no randomized trials specifically addressing the efficacy of these drugs in non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). Observational studies have attempted to evaluate patients with STEMI and those with NSTEMI.</p><p>Many of the relevant studies were performed before the routine use of long-term antiplatelet and statin therapy.

A 1999 meta-analysis, which included trials of patients (n = 24,974) who did or did not receive fibrinolytic therapy, found that beta blockers reduced the odds of death by 23 percent (95% CI 15-31) when taken long term, a result comparable to that seen in patients who received no reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary PCI &ndash; The evidence presented above, supporting long-term beta blocker use in patients treated with or without fibrinolysis, provides the basis for a similar recommendation in patients who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Some experts have suggested that the benefit of beta blockers in this subpopulation may be reduced by the improvement in outcome afforded by revascularization. There have been no randomized trials and few observational studies of long-term beta blocker therapy patients treated with primary PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Three large observational studies have come to differing conclusions:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One observational study evaluated mortality in over 20,000 STEMI patients (2005 to 2010) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a propensity-matched analysis of 2650 patients who received and 1325 who did not receive a beta blocker at discharge, treatment was associated with a lower incidence of all-cause death (2.8 versus 4.1 percent; adjusted hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.78) during a median follow-up of about one year. In addition, the result was consistent across all subgroups, including those at relatively low risk, such as those with left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;40 percent and those with single-vessel disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a meta-analysis of 10 observational studies of patients (n = 16,645) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction who underwent PCI, there was no difference in one-year mortality group between those receiving or not receiving beta blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A second study evaluated outcomes in 88,522 STEMI and 81,993 NSTEMI patients (2007 to 2013) who did not have heart failure or left ventricular systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The overall one-year mortality was 5.2 percent.

There is no consistent evidence of benefit from the use of intravenous beta blocker use prior to primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We reserve the intravenous route principally for patients with refractory angina <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypertension who have ongoing ischemia prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in whom there is no hemodynamic instability, risk for shock, heart failure, or other contraindications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4232940703\"><span class=\"h2\">LV dysfunction/heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the studies discussed directly below were performed before the availability of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and generally did not assess patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,16</a>]. They were also performed before the strong beneficial effects of beta blockers in heart failure were demonstrated. The use of beta blockers in patients with heart failure due to systolic dysfunction is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibrinolytic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While, in the aggregate, the available evidence does not support routine, early initiation of intravenous beta blockade in patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy, we do recommend oral therapy. This recommendation for these patients is based on the overall benefit of beta blockers. (See <a href=\"#H121273941\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p>Three randomized trials (1989, 1991, and 1993) of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy compared early and deferred beta blocker therapy and found no clear evidence of a mortality benefit with early beta blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/22,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,30,31</a>]. In these studies, deferred therapy occurred within 24 hours to up to six days.</p><p>The findings were somewhat similar in the randomized <span class=\"nowrap\">COMMIT/CCS2</span> trial of almost 46,000 MI patients (93 percent with ST elevation or left bundle branch block), one-half of whom received fibrinolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In this trial, patients were randomly assigned to placebo or to three 5 mg intravenous boluses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> tartrate followed by oral metoprolol extended release (succinate) 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for 30 days. There was no overall mortality benefit from early intravenous beta blocker therapy. However, hemodynamic stability appeared to be an important determinant of the response to beta blockers. There was a significant increase in mortality in patients who presented with hemodynamic compromise that was balanced by a trend toward reduced mortality in patients who were hemodynamically stable. Importantly, patients with hemodynamic compromise and who received beta blockers did not go through a period of up-titration of the drug, raising the possibility that a more careful use of early intravenous beta blocker may improve outcomes.</p><p>Some evidence of benefit of early intravenous administration comes from the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TIMI-IIB trial randomly assigned 1434 patients to either early intravenous (IV) therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> tartrate, 15 mg IV given in three equal doses at two-minute intervals if tolerated, followed by 50 mg orally twice daily for the first day and 100 mg orally twice daily thereafter) or to delayed oral beta blockade (metoprolol, 50 mg twice daily on day six and 100 mg twice daily thereafter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate beta blocker therapy may reduce the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33</a>]. This effect was suggested in a review of data from 60,329 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Immediate beta blocker use was associated with a lower incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (0.67 versus 1 percent for no immediate beta blocker; odds ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.57-0.84).

It should also be kept in mind that clinical experience has shown that intravenous therapy has worsened outcomes in patients with hemodynamic instability or evidence of Killip Class II or III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65592\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65592 \">table 1</a>) heart failure. It must be given cautiously or avoided in these patients. &#160; </p><p>Two randomized trials, each with significant limitations, have evaluated the role of intravenous beta blocker before primary PCI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In METOCARD-CNIC, 270 patients with Killip class II or less (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65592\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65592 \">table 1</a>) anterior STEMI were randomly assigned to receive intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> (up to three 5 mg boluses of metoprolol tartrate given two minutes apart) or not before reperfusion and all patients received oral metoprolol within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The primary end point of infarct size on magnetic resonance imaging performed five to seven days was significantly smaller in the group that was treated early (25.6 versus 32.0 grams; p = 0.012).

There was no difference in the safety end point. Limitations of the study include lack of a placebo control and exclusion of patients with inferior MI. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the EARLY-BAMI trial, 683 patients with STEMI were randomly assigned to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> (two sequential 5 mg boluses) or placebo before PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The first bolus was given in the ambulance. The primary end point of myocardial infarct size (percent of LV), as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 30 days, was performed in 342 patients. There was no difference in infarct size between the two groups (15.3 versus 14.9 percent, respectively). Supporting this finding of no difference was a lack of difference in the secondary end point of peak and area under the creatinine kinase curve. Limitations of the study include failure to achieve the necessary sample size for the primary end point, the possibility that the groups with and without measurement of the primary end point were not well balanced, and a smaller than estimated infarct size than predicted, which may have made it harder to find a true difference. There was no difference in the rate of adverse events between the two groups.</p><p/><p>Observational studies have also not shown convincing evidence of benefit from early intravenous beta blocker use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An apparent benefit from preprocedural intravenous administration of a beta blocker was also shown in a retrospective analysis from the CADILLAC trial of 2082 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].
