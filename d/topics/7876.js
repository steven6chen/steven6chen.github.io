Natural acute grief reactions are often painful and impairing with emotional and somatic distress, but should not be diagnosed as a mental disorder. However, bereavement is a stressor that can precipitate or worsen mental disorders (eg, unipolar major depression). In addition, complications (maladaptive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors) may occur, such that acute grief becomes intense, prolonged, and debilitating. This condition is called complicated grief, which is viewed as a unique and recognizable disorder that requires specific treatment.</p><p>Acute grief does not typically require treatment. Most bereaved individuals are resilient and grief is transformed and integrated during a natural adaptive process that typically unfolds with the support and encouragement of close family and friends, as well as clergy.</p><p>This topic discusses the management of grief and bereavement.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features#H11410500\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Bereavement'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grief</strong> &ndash; Grief is the natural response (including thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and physiologic reactions) to bereavement. Although grief can occur in response to other meaningful (non-bereavement) losses, this topic focuses upon grief in response to the death of a loved one.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The pattern and intensity of grief varies over time as the bereaved person adapts to the loss. The experience of grief is influenced by cultural and religious rituals that vary widely, and is unique to each person and each loss. Acute grief can be intense and disruptive but is eventually integrated. Progress from acute to integrated grief is often erratic and hard to discern as it is happening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features#H8568685\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Typical acute grief'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complicated grief </strong>&ndash; Complicated grief is a form of acute grief that is unusually prolonged, intense, and disabling; troubling thoughts, dysfunctional behaviors, dysregulated emotions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serious psychosocial problems impede adaptation to the loss. The syndrome of complicated grief is a unique and recognizable condition that can be differentiated from other mental disorders. Other terms that have been used to describe complicated grief include chronic grief, complex grief, pathological grief, persistent complex bereavement disorder, prolonged grief disorder, traumatic grief, and unresolved grief. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complicated grief in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mourning</strong> &ndash; Mourning is the process of adapting to a loss and integrating grief. Adaptation entails accepting the finality and consequences of the loss, revising the internalized relationship with deceased, and re-envisioning the future such that there is a possibility for happiness in a world without the deceased. When mourning is successful, the painful and disruptive experience of acute grief is transformed into an experience of integrated grief that is bittersweet and in the background. Like grief, mourning is influenced by cultural and religious rituals that vary widely.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H427654\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H427660\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If possible, clinicians should summon families prior to an expected death.

Most bereaved individuals are resilient and acute grief is transformed and integrated during a natural adaptive process that typically unfolds with the support and encouragement of close family and friends, as well as clergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Grief work (confronting painful emotions) on its own does not appear to facilitate adjustment to bereavement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], and bereaved individuals who experience little distress, even when they suppress their emotions, have been shown to have a benign course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, embarking on an uncovering or personality-targeted psychotherapy may derail the natural healing process and is potentially harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/1,4,5,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5,9-12</a>]. Guidelines from the World Health Organization for bereaved individuals who do not have mental disorders recommend that structured psychological interventions should not be routinely offered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Randomized trials indicate that psychotherapy is generally unnecessary for bereaved individuals:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 36 trials (sample size not specified) compared grief interventions (usually psychotherapy or counseling) with control conditions (eg, waiting list) for outcomes such as grief, general distress, depression, social functioning, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> somatic symptoms. The analysis found a significant but clinically small benefit at posttreatment that was not maintained at follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of nine trials compared interventions (eg, support groups) intended to prevent complicated grief with control conditions (eg, usual care or minimal treatment) in 1545 bereaved individuals, and found that the incidence of complicated grief was comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent randomized trial compared psychoeducation (four sessions, each lasting two hours, administered during home visits) with no intervention in 83 individuals bereaved through suicide; improvement of depressive symptoms (including suicidal ideation) and complicated grief symptoms in the two groups was comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>However, grief counseling can be helpful specifically for bereaved individuals who request it, and may also be helpful when it is coupled with other efforts that are focused upon new activities as well as experiences intended to restore one&rsquo;s life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Acute grief can comprise highly activated emotions that need to be regulated. One way this regulation appears to occur naturally is by alternating (oscillating) between confronting the painful reality of the loss, and then setting the pain aside in order to focus on something emotionally neutral or positive. Diversions from the painful loss can be related to the deceased, such as comforting memories of the deceased, or related to life without the deceased, such as new activities, roles, relationships, and future plans. Clinicians should be aware that bereaved individuals, especially those who have lost children, often find it very difficult to speak about the loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Although writing about grief and negative thoughts, as well as positive events and thoughts, does not appear to improve grief or depressive symptoms (eg, anorexia, insomnia, and anhedonia), writing may reduce loneliness and improve positive mood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>For bereaved individuals who do not have mental disorders, we generally do not use benzodiazepines. A six-week randomized trial compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> (2 mg, up to three times per day) with placebo in 30 individuals who were bereaved within the past two weeks; patients were allotted 20 tablets for the entire study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Outcomes were comparable at the end of treatment and at the six-month follow-up. Our approach is consistent with treatment guidelines from the World Health Organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H428119\"><span class=\"h2\">Support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Support from family, friends, and clergy is usually sufficient to manage the pain of acute grief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although the majority of bereaved individuals have sufficient resources to adapt to loss without relying upon health professionals, virtually all will appreciate acknowledgement of the loss and support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Some bereaved people are surprised and frightened by the intensity and quality of their grief reaction and may present to clinicians; health professionals can help by providing support, information, and reassurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/1,4,5,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5,9-11</a>]. Primary care clinicians are a natural source of support for bereaved individuals and typically view bereavement care as important and satisfying; however, many clinicians feel inadequately trained.</p><p>Support from clinicians for acute grief typically includes empathic listening, information about the wide range of typical grief symptoms, reassurance, and monitoring. Condolence letters, telephone calls, attending the funeral or memorial service, and home visits may be helpful as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Suggestions for communicating with grieving patients are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F94492\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94492 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>For patients who are worried about their reaction to the death, education may be helpful. As an example, patients without mental disorders may be alarmed by hallucinations of the deceased, and can be reassured that this is not a manifestation of psychotic illness. Some people worry about the intensity or uncontrollability of emotions; this too is a typical feature of acute grief. The presentation and course of acute grief are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features#H8568685\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Typical acute grief'</a>.)</p><p>Encouraging patients to maintain regular patterns of activity, sleep, exercise, and nutrition may help adaptation to the loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Bereaved individuals may forget to care for themselves and may withdraw socially. If the deceased person lived in the same house, meals can trigger intense feelings of missing the person. Patients may eat food that a loved one especially enjoyed in order to feel close to the person, or avoid foods that serve as reminders of the loss. Sleep can be disrupted as well. (See <a href=\"#H428254\" class=\"local\">'Insomnia'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinicians can guide bereaved patients in managing social or environmental problems that supervene in the aftermath of a loss and become the focus of thoughts and behaviors. As an example, if a widow is left with insufficient funds to support herself, her partner&rsquo;s affairs are in disarray, or she is ostracized or blamed after the death of a loved one, these situations demand attention because they may interfere with adaptation, trigger a depressive or anxiety disorder, or lead to complicated grief.</p><p>If support from family, friends, and clinicians is not adequate or available, referral to support groups may be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some groups target particular types of deaths, such as conjugal bereavement, death of a child, suicides, HIV infection, or violent crime. Local hospice organizations can usually help identify community resources.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H428236\"><span class=\"h2\">Mental disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bereavement may precipitate or exacerbate suicidal ideation and behavior as well as mental disorders such as major depression, anxiety disorders, and PTSD.

Patients unresponsive to behavioral therapy often receive additional treatment with hypnotic medications (eg, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>). However, sleep may be disrupted by several disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), which require assessment for diagnosis (eg, full-night, attended, in-laboratory polysomnography), as well as treatments. Additional information about insomnia and sleep disorders is discussed separately.
