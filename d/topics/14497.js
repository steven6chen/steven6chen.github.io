In men, this gland sits below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It forms a ring around the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65675 \">figure 1</a>). (Women do not have a prostate gland.)</p><p>The main test used to screen for prostate cancer is a blood test called a &quot;PSA test.&quot; Some men also have an exam called a rectal exam (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80412\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80412 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29810067\"><span class=\"h1\">Who should be screened for prostate cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate cancer screening is done in men who have no symptoms of the disease. It is not clear whether getting screened for prostate cancer can extend a man's life or help him avoid any symptoms or problems. For this reason, doctors do not know who &ndash; if anyone &ndash; should be screened for prostate cancer.</p><p>Most experts recommend that each man work with his doctor or nurse to decide whether screening is right for him. In most cases, men should start discussing prostate cancer screening around the age of 50. Men with risk factors for prostate cancer (such as black men or men with a family history of prostate cancer) might want to begin screening at age 40 to 45. Most doctors recommend against screening for men age 70 or older, or for men with serious health problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29810074\"><span class=\"h1\">Why do doctors offer screening?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors offer screening in the hopes of catching prostate cancer early &ndash; before it has a chance to grow, spread, or cause symptoms. With many cancers, catching the disease early is an important part of effective treatment. But prostate cancer is not like many other cancers. It usually grows slowly and does not usually lead to death. The problem is that a small number of prostate cancers <strong>are</strong> serious and can lead to death. Doctors do not have an ideal way to tell which prostate cancers are deadly and which ones would never cause any problems.</p><p>Certain tests can suggest which prostate cancers might be more likely to cause problems. But the tests are far from perfect. Also, different studies have come to different conclusions about the benefits of screening and whether or not it lowers the risk of dying from prostate cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29810081\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the drawbacks to getting screened?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PSA tests have 2 main drawbacks:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PSA tests sometimes give &quot;false positives,&quot; meaning they indicate cancer when there is no cancer. This can lead to unneeded worry and to further tests &ndash; including one test (a biopsy) that can be briefly painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When PSA tests lead to the discovery of cancer, there is very often no way to tell whether the cancer is one that could do harm. That means that men sometimes get treated for cancers that would not have done them any harm. That's a problem because treatment for prostate cancer has risks and often causes problems of its own. For instance, prostate cancer treatment can cause men to leak urine and to have problems with sex.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29810088\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I decide if I should be screened?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Work with your doctor or nurse to decide if screening is right for you. As you are deciding, think about how likely it is that you will get prostate cancer. Black men and men who have a brother or father with the disease are more likely than other men to get it. For men with a high risk of prostate cancer, screening might be a good idea.</p><p>Think, too, about how you feel about the possible benefits and harms of being screened. Ask yourself:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do I want to know if I have prostate cancer, even if the cancer might never do me any harm?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Would I be treated if I learned that I had prostate cancer?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How do I feel about the risks of being treated for prostate cancer?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How do I feel about the risks of getting a deadly or aggressive form of prostate cancer?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Would I be willing to accept a high risk of side effects from treatment in return for a small chance of living longer?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29810095\"><span class=\"h1\">What is a PSA test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PSA stands for &quot;prostate-specific antigen.&quot; PSA is a protein made by the prostate. Levels of this protein usually go up when a man has prostate cancer. The protein also goes up for reasons that do <strong>not</strong> involve cancer. For example, PSA levels rise when a man:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), sometimes called an enlarged prostate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a prostate infection, also called prostatitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hurts his prostate, for example while riding a bike</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ejaculates (has an orgasm)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29810102\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my PSA level is too high?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your PSA level is high, do not panic. It's possible your PSA is high for reasons unrelated to cancer. If your PSA level is only somewhat high, often the next step is to have the PSA test again. For 2 days before the second test, avoid ejaculating and bike-riding. If your doctor thinks you have a prostate infection, you might also need to take antibiotics for a while before you repeat the test.</p><p>If your PSA is still high on the second test, or if it was very high the first time, you will probably need more testing. This might include a biopsy or other test. A biopsy means that a doctor will insert a needle into your prostate to take tiny samples of tissue. Those samples will then go to the lab to be checked for cancer.</p><p>If it turns out you do have cancer, remember that prostate cancer is not usually deadly. It usually grows slowly, so you probably have time to decide what to do. There are treatments that can sometimes cure prostate cancer. But men sometimes hold off on having treatment and wait to see if their cancer shows signs of progressing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29810109\"><span class=\"h1\">How often should a man be screened for prostate cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those who decide to be screened, experts recommend repeating screening every 2 to 4 years.</p><p>Men can stop being screened when they turn 70 or if they develop serious health problems. In these cases, the benefits of screening are not worth the possible harms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29810237\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prostate cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-treatment-for-low-risk-localized-prostate-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing treatment for low-risk localized prostate cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-enlarged-prostate-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Prostate cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-advanced-prostate-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Treatment for advanced prostate cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-treatment-stage-i-to-iii-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Prostate cancer treatment; stage I to III cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-bph-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
