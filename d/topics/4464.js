Among the 431 cases of congenital syphilis reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2008, approximately one-third were born to mothers who did not receive prenatal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-syphilis-evaluation-management-and-prevention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Although the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that newborn infants remain hospitalized until there is documentation of the mother's syphilis serology (at least once during pregnancy and ideally again at delivery), adherence to this recommendation may be difficult, particularly when an early discharge is planned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-syphilis-evaluation-management-and-prevention/abstract/3,4,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,44</a>].</p><p>The possibility of false negative results of nontreponemal serology is another important limitation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-screening-and-diagnostic-testing#H3955025181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Screening and diagnostic testing&quot;, section on 'Negative nontreponemal test in early syphilis'</a>).
