Observational studies and at least two prospective, randomized clinical trials have evaluated clinical outcomes in patients who were prescribed the &quot;standard&quot; dose of dialysis compared with those with a &quot;higher&quot; dose of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Based on these data, the following parameters are generally used to guide treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small solute clearance (using <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> as the surrogate)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Residual renal function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of uremic symptoms, mineral metabolism, and electrolytes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid balance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequacy of nutrition</p><p/><p>Total solute clearance consists of clearance by dialysis plus residual renal function. The minimum dialysis that should be performed is thus based upon the desired total solute clearance and the amount of residual renal function that is present. Residual renal function tends to decline over time on dialysis. If, in an individual patient, significant residual renal function is contributing to total solute clearance at the start of dialysis, then the dialysis dose may need to be increased as residual function declines over time.</p><p>The desired total solute clearance is guided by outcome studies and consensus recommendations. If the minimum solute clearance based on population studies is achieved, further modifications of the dialysis dose may be made based upon patient-specific factors, including control of uremic symptoms, volume status, mineral metabolism and electrolytes, and adequacy of nutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1128862652\"><span class=\"h1\">SOLUTE CLEARANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among peritoneal dialysis patients, total solute clearance is the sum of clearances provided by peritoneal dialysis and residual renal function. Methods of determining clearance provided by peritoneal dialysis and by residual renal function are provided below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1683437066\"><span class=\"h2\">Solute clearance provided by peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two metrics that are commonly used to estimate total small solute clearance by peritoneal dialysis. These metrics include the weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> and the creatinine clearance normalized to body surface area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We suggest using the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> to estimate peritoneal dialysis small solute clearance, which is consistent with the 2006 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, the 2005 European Best Practices Guidelines (EBPG), and the 2006 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) <span class=\"nowrap\">guidelines/recommendations</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> is calculated from the daily peritoneal urea clearance (Kt) and the volume of distribution of urea (Vurea).</p><p>The daily peritoneal urea clearance (Kt) is the product of the total 24-hour peritoneal drain volume and the ratio of the urea concentration in the pooled drained dialysate to that in the plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/P</span> urea). A 24-hour collection of dialysate is used rather than shorter collections because it provides more accurate estimates of clearance compared with values obtained from shorter collections or from kinetic modelling programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The volume of distribution of urea (Vurea) is approximately equal to body water (ie, 60 percent of ideal body weight in kg in men and 55 percent of ideal body weight in kg in women). Consistent with KDOQI guidelines, we use the ideal body weight rather than the actual body weight to estimate the volume of distribution for urea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This is because using the actual body weight to estimate V often results in under- or overestimating the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. As a result, very large patients may appear underdialyzed (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is low) despite eating well and clinically doing well, while severely malnourished individuals may appear to have an adequate <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> while at the same time having some uremic symptoms and doing poorly clinically. Overestimating the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> in patients who are losing weight <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malnourished is especially problematic because inadequate dialysis is often a cause of anorexia and malnutrition.</p><p>An example of <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> calculation for a representative patient is provided below.</p><p>A 70 kg man on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has a total 24-hour peritoneal drain volume of 10.5 L. The measured dialysate and plasma urea concentrations are 38 and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> respectively. Using these values, the calculated <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> urea is 0.95, and the Kt is 9.975 L (10.5 x 0.95) (or approximately 10 L). The urea volume of distribution (V) is roughly equal to 42 L (60 percent or 0.6 x 72 Kg).</p><p>As a result:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> Daily <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> = 10 &divide; 42 = 0.238 or 0.24</p></div></div><p>The weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> is equal to this value multiplied by seven days:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> Weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> = 0.24 x 7 = 1.68</p></div></div><p>The daily <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> needed to achieve a weekly (ie, standardized) <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.7 is a minimum of 0.25. For <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 0.25, the total drain <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/day</span> would have to be at least 25 percent of the patient's estimated body water (V) if the drained fluid is 100 percent saturated with urea (ie, the <span class=\"nowrap\">D/P</span> urea is 1.0). Since complete saturation is very unlikely to happen, for an anuric patient, the total drain volume (instilled plus any ultrafiltration minus any fluid absorbed) would have to be greater than 25 percent of the patient's estimated V.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H649141901\"><span class=\"h2\">Solute clearance provided by residual renal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients who have significant renal function, the solute clearance provided by kidney function is added to the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> provided by peritoneal dialysis for total solute clearance. Significant renal function is defined by National Kidney Foundation (NKF)-KDOQI as a urine volume of &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Patients with a significant amount of residual renal function may be treated, at least initially, with a low dose of peritoneal dialysis, which is increased as residual renal function decreases. This approach of gradually increasing the dialysis dose over time is referred to as incremental dialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a modality for chronic peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Residual renal function'</a>.)</p><p>Among selected patients with significant residual renal function, low-dose peritoneal dialysis may be sufficient for a number of months. One study found that a weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> of 2.0 could be maintained for approximately 1.5 years by using only one or two nightly exchanges among patients with significant residual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In this setting, when residual renal function is a significant portion of total solute clearance, the total solute clearance (peritoneal and residual renal function) should be closely monitored (see <a href=\"#H649141675\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of monitoring'</a> below). As residual renal function declines, the clearance that is provided by peritoneal dialysis must be increased in order to meet the target total <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>.</p><p>Some clinicians ignore the contribution of residual renal function to total solute clearance and prescribe the total minimum recommended dialysis dose (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> &ge;1.7) from initiation. However, as a result, the patient ends up performing more dialysis than he or she actually requires, which could make the peritoneal dialysis prescription more demanding and time consuming for the patient than necessary.</p><p>The contribution of residual renal function can be estimated by determining the 24-hour urea clearance from a 24-hour urine collection and from the plasma urea. The 24-hour urine collection is usually routinely performed by the patient at the same time that the 24-hour peritoneal dialysate is collected for calculation of the peritoneal dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1683437066\" class=\"local\">'Solute clearance provided by peritoneal dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p>The 24-hour urea clearance is calculated as follows:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"> [Urine urea <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/dL)</span> x urine volume <span class=\"nowrap\">(mL)]/plasma</span> urea <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/dL)</span> = urea clearance (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span></p></div></div><p/><p>Urea clearance in <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> x 1400 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/day</span> provides the urea clearance per day.</p><p>As an example:</p><p>A 70 kg man on CAPD has a urine output of 500 mL per day. The measured urine and plasma urea concentrations are 230 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> respectively. The urea clearance is:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>[230 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> x 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL]/40</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL=</span> 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span></p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> x 1440 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/day</span> = 2880 mL (or 2.88 L) per day</p></div></div><p>The urea clearance per day is normalized to total body volume and then multiplied by 7 for the total weekly clearance provided by residual renal function.</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>[2.88 L per <span class=\"nowrap\">day/42</span> L] x 7 = 0.48</p></div></div><p>This number is added to the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> provided by peritoneal dialysis for the total achieved <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. Alternatively, to determine the minimum amount of peritoneal dialysis that should be prescribed, this number is subtracted from the target total <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V:</span> If the target total <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is &ge;1.7, sufficient dialysis should be performed to provide a peritoneal <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> &ge;1.2 since 1.7 - 0.5 = 1.2.</p><p>In such a patient, the residual clearance would constitute approximately 30 percent of the weekly targeted <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> (0.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/1</span>.7), which is considerable. As noted above, if this patient loses residual renal function, failure to account for the loss of residual renal function over time by increasing the dialysis dose could lead to underdialysis, even though there has been no decline in the peritoneal dialysis efficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F71878\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71878 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1128865437\"><span class=\"h2\">Target Kt/Vurea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two commonly used peritoneal dialysis modalities include CAPD and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). Recommendations for minimum total <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> for both modalities are provided below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1128865443\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CAPD involves multiple exchanges during the day (usually three), followed by an overnight dwell (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a modality for chronic peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Types of peritoneal dialysis'</a>). For all patients on CAPD, we suggest a target <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> &ge;1.7. As noted above, this target may be achieved by peritoneal dialysis alone or by peritoneal dialysis plus residual renal function. Among some patients, the actual delivered total solute clearance ends up slightly lower than prescribed. Thus, to ensure that all patients meet the minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> &ge;1.7, we prescribe a target dose of &ge;1.<span class=\"nowrap\">8/week</span>.</p><p>Studies have suggested that <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> &lt;1.7 is associated with increasing uremic symptoms, poor nutrition, and anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1,11,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,14-16</a>]. The best data are from a randomized study from Hong Kong in which 320 new CAPD patients were assigned to a target <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> of 1.5 to 1.7, 1.7 to 2.0, or &gt;2.0 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All patients had residual renal clearance &lt;1.0, and the clearance provided by residual renal function was added to the peritoneal clearance. There were no differences between groups in survival, serum albumin levels, and hospitalization rates. However, patients assigned to a dialysis dose of &lt;1.7 required higher doses of erythropoietin and had more uremic symptoms than those in the other two groups.</p><p>Targeting a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> significantly higher than 1.7 does not appear to provide additional benefit. This was suggested by two prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] and in multiple observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p>The 2006 KDOQI guidelines, the 2005 EBPG, and the 2006 ISPD <span class=\"nowrap\">guidelines/recommendations</span> also suggest a minimum weekly target <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> of 1.7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1128865449\"><span class=\"h3\">Automated peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>APD uses a cycler to perform multiple overnight exchanges. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a modality for chronic peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Types of peritoneal dialysis'</a>.)</p><p>The prescription may only utilize overnight exchanges (called dry day) or, if needed, will include multiple overnight exchanges and a daytime dwell (also called last big fill or wet day). Some patients may need an additional manual daytime exchange to meet solute clearance targets or blood pressure and volume control goals.</p><p>For all patients on APD, we suggest that the minimal dose of <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> should be &ge;1.7 per week, consistent with the 2006 KDOQI work group recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. To ensure that all patients meet the minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> &ge;1.7, we prescribe a target dose of 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">8/week</span>.</p><p>In addition to achieving the minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.7, we suggest that patients who are on APD and are anuric or who have minimal urine volume perform a last bag fill (daytime dwell) and, at times, a manual exchange during the day, in addition to the nightly exchanges. This is because <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> recommendations for APD patients are based upon studies of CAPD patients, who (unlike many APD patients) undergo dialysis 24 hours per day. It is possible that the optimal dialysis prescription includes not only achieving the minimal small solute clearance goal but also optimizing clearance of middle molecular weight solutes, which requires 24 hours of dialysis daily.

The association of residual renal function with survival was also reported in subsequent observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. As an example, in a report of nearly 2700 patients, each mL per minute increase in the renal creatinine clearance, but not the peritoneal dialysis clearance, was associated with a 12 percent reduction in the odds ratio for death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Measures to preserve residual renal function include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rigorous control of blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), whether or not the patient is hypertensive</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of nephrotoxins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of repeated episodes of volume depletion from overaggressive ultrafiltration</p><p/><p>In general, if blood pressure tolerates it, all patients on peritoneal dialysis who have residual renal function should be treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB, whether hypertensive or not. Two randomized trials have shown that the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs preserves residual renal function in peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In both studies, the effect of the ACE inhibitor or ARB was independent of blood pressure control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>The optimal dose is not known, and the dose may be limited among patients who do not have hypertension. Among patients who are hypertensive, we start with a low dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> 5 mg per day) and titrate to the maximum effective dose (eg, lisinopril 40 mg per day) to target an optimal blood pressure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-in-dialysis-patients#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension in dialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Benefits of treating hypertension'</a>). We decrease or stop other antihypertensive medications as necessary to allow the maximum effective dose of ACE inhibitor or ARB.</p><p>Among patients who are not hypertensive, we start with an even lower dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> 2.5 mg per day) and titrate to the maximum dose (eg, lisinopril 40 mg per day) that does not cause hypotension (ie, blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;120/80</span> mmHg). We often ask patients to monitor blood pressure at home. We generally check the serum potassium one week after starting the medication or increasing the dose.</p><p>Other agents may be used as necessary to attain optimal blood pressure control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-in-dialysis-patients#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension in dialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Benefits of treating hypertension'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT COMPLIANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are frequently noncompliant with the prescribed peritoneal dialysis regimen, although it is difficult to document the incidence of noncompliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>]. As many as 11 percent of patients who switch to hemodialysis do so because of noncompliance with peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Compliance is a particular problem among patients who require a large number of exchanges in order to obtain the recommended dialysis dose. Changes in the dialysis prescription may increase compliance among such patients.</p><p>As an example, the dialysis dose may be increased by either increasing the number of exchanges per day or increasing the volume per exchange. Although the dialysis dose is often increased by adding exchanges, using larger volumes per exchange may encourage compliance. Many patients are reluctant to use increased volumes because of the fear of abdominal discomfort. This concern appears to be unfounded. This was illustrated in a blinded study in which 15 of 20 patients (75 percent) were unable to distinguish among 2, 2.5, and 3 liter exchange volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In addition, discomfort was not more common with the 3 liter exchange than with lower volumes. Increasing exchange volumes were associated with greater clearances of both creatinine and urea.</p><p>Increases in volume should be made gradually. Increasing fill volumes by 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/exchange</span> per week allows volume increases without provoking noticeable symptoms. Although, for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, the standard available dialysate bags are in 500 mL increments (ie, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 L bags), one does not need to increase the instilled volume by 500 mL increments. Rather, the patient may infuse a lower volume than is provided. Among automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients, smaller increases in volume are easily done by programming the cycler.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

For all chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, we recommend that the minimal delivered total (peritoneal and residual kidney) solute clearance of <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> should be &ge;<strong>1.<span class=\"nowrap\">7/week</strong></span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In order to achieve the minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> we target total <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> of 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">8/week</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1128865443\" class=\"local\">'Chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minimum dialysis for patients for patients on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) is not known. For APD patients, we suggest that the minimal delivered total (peritoneal and residual kidney) solute clearance of <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> should be &ge;<strong>1.<span class=\"nowrap\">7/week</strong></span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In order to achieve the minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> we target total <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> of 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">8/week</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to achieving the minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 1.7, we suggest that patients who are on APD and are anuric or who have minimal urine volume perform a daytime dwell and at times another manual exchange during the day in addition to the nightly exchanges. This is because recommendations for <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> for APD patients are based upon studies of CAPD patients, who undergo dialysis 24 hours per day. (See <a href=\"#H1128865449\" class=\"local\">'Automated peritoneal dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If significant renal residual renal function (defined as &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span> is contributing to solute clearance, the dialysis dose should be increased as residual function declines. (See <a href=\"#H649141901\" class=\"local\">'Solute clearance provided by residual renal function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For both CAPD and APD patients, even if the minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is achieved, the dialysis dose should be increased if there are persistent uremic symptoms such as anorexia or nausea, or persistent acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, or evidence of malnutrition. (See <a href=\"#H1128864125\" class=\"local\">'Control of uremic symptoms, mineral metabolism, and electrolytes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We target ultrafiltration goals to achieve euvolemia and optimal blood pressure control. We do not target a minimum daily ultrafiltration volume. (See <a href=\"#H1128864248\" class=\"local\">'Fluid balance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> and residual renal function should be measured in all patients within four weeks after initiating peritoneal dialysis. Thereafter, peritoneal <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> should be measured every four months. If residual renal function is contributing to the total <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V,</span> residual renal function should be checked at least every two months. (See <a href=\"#H649141675\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measures should be taken to preserve renal function. For all patients who have residual renal function and are hypertensive, we recommend the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The use of such agents has been shown to preserve residual renal function in peritoneal dialysis patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who are not hypertensive and who can tolerate such agents, we suggest the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The protective effect of ACE inhibitors and ARBS on residual renal function appears to be independent of blood pressure control. The dose of the ACE inhibitor or ARB may be limited by low blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other measures to preserve residual renal function include the rigorous control of blood pressure, the avoidance of nephrotoxins, and the avoidance of repeated episodes of volume depletion from overaggressive ultrafiltration. (See <a href=\"#H1128865005\" class=\"local\">'Preservation of residual renal function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1208224201\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge William L Henrich, MD, MACP, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lo WK, Ho YW, Li CS, et al.
