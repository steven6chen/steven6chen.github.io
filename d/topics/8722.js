All medical facilities or health departments that provide direct patient care are encouraged to formulate and implement a comprehensive immunization policy for all health care providers. This policy should describe exactly what the risk of exposure to vaccine preventable diseases is, according to job description.</p><p>Recommendations for immunization should be based upon the risk of exposure. All new employees should receive a prompt review of their immunization status prior to starting to care for patients; in addition, all employees should have an annual review to ensure that immunizations remain up to date.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4539745\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical documentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunization is recommended when prior vaccine administration cannot be documented, unless the health care provider has a contraindication to vaccine administration. Serologic screening for immunity is generally <strong>not</strong> considered cost-effective. All vaccine-related information should be documented in the health care provider's medical record [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4539752\"><span class=\"h2\">Failure to immunize</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite these recommendations, large numbers of health care providers lack immunity to hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, and rubella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-15</a>]. There are two major reasons for failure of the recommendations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some health care providers refuse to be immunized. In one study of medical school clinical employees, for example, only 77 percent completed the hepatitis B vaccine series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Reasons why health care providers refuse vaccines for these diseases include: desire to avoid medications, concern about side effects, belief that the vaccine is ineffective (influenza), and belief that the risk of acquiring disease is low (hepatitis B) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. Factors that predict acceptance of the influenza vaccine included older age, higher economic status, and prior work absenteeism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second reason for failure to immunize health care providers is inadequate policies and inconsistent enforcement of policies. In a community-wide outbreak of measles that occurred in 1996, only 47 percent of medical facilities had an immunization policy and only 21 percent of facilities met Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations and enforced their policy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There has also been wide variability in immunization policies for health care providers. In a national survey of children's hospitals, more than 90 percent of the institutions surveyed reported cases of each of the following diseases in their institution in the last five years: measles, tuberculosis, hepatitis B, varicella, and influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Education and interventions such as the use of mobile carts that facilitate access to immunization increases immunization rates, but levels remain sub-optimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">WHICH VACCINES SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General recommendations regarding immunization of immunocompetent health care providers have been published by the CDC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>], the Association for Professionals in Infection and Epidemiology, Inc (APIC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], the ACP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and infectious diseases experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. The general approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All health care providers should be immune to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All health care providers with potential exposure to blood or body fluids should be immune to hepatitis B.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All health care providers should be offered annual immunization with influenza vaccine.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All health care workers should receive a one-time dose of Tdap as soon as possible, unless they are certain that they have received Tdap.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All health care providers should either be offered immunizations that are routinely recommended for adults, such as tetanus, diphtheria, and pneumococcal vaccine, or be referred to their primary care provider.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At risk health care providers and laboratory personnel should be offered the following vaccines: polio, meningococcal, BCG, rabies, plague, typhoid, and hepatitis A.</p><p/><p>Immunocompromised health care providers require special considerations.

This decrease is due, in large part, to vaccination of HCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>HBV is more transmissible than hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76403 \">table 1</a>). The risk of developing HBV infection is greatest after a needlestick injury. However, infection with HBV has also occurred in HCP who cannot recall any percutaneous exposure. In this setting, infection has been attributed to breaks in the skin or inoculation through mucous membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. </p><p>There are a variety of sources of HBV other than blood-containing specimens in the health care environment. These include: contaminated medical instruments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/32-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-37</a>], environmental surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and contaminated file cards among laboratory technicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In dialysis units, transmission of HBV has been associated with the use of common-dose medications and shared equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1991 mandates that hepatitis B vaccine be made available at the employer's expense to all health care providers who are occupationally exposed to blood or other infectious materials or sharps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This recommendation is supported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Accelerated schedules result in a more rapid antibody rise than traditional dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>HCP who are incompletely vaccinated do not need to restart the series; however they should receive additional doses to complete it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In someone who only received one dose, the second and third doses should be given eight weeks apart.

Unfortunately, 5 to 21 percent of health care providers do not develop a protective level of anti-HBs after three doses of vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Lower rates of seroconversion are associated with increasing age, greater immunocompromise, current smoking, and higher body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]. </p><p>Anti-HBs should be measured using a quantitative test and further management depends upon the antibody level. Health care providers who have not developed a protective response may receive up to three additional doses of the vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The following approach is summarized below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the anti-HBs level is &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> the individual is considered a vaccine responder and is felt to be protected against HBV infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the anti-HBs titer is &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/ML</span> the individual should receive a single additional dose of vaccine and have anti-HBs titers repeated in one to two months.

Although vaccine-induced antibodies decline gradually with time, the majority of patients will continue to have protective immunity. As an example, in a study of 159 HCP who were vaccinated between the ages of 18 and 60, approximately 75 percent of individuals had protective anti-HBs levels 10 to 31 years after they received their initial vaccine series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>However, HCP who had a documented response (ie anti-HBs &gt; 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL)</span> to the initial vaccine series remain protected against clinical hepatitis and chronic infection, even when their anti-HBs levels become low or undetectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/7,43,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,43,54</a>]. Thus, for HCP without detectable titers, we agree with the CDC who recommends the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Booster doses of vaccine are <strong>not</strong> recommended for immunocompetent HCP who had a documented response (ie anti-HBs &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL)</span> to the initial vaccine series. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A booster dose of vaccine should be given to assess immunity in a patient who did not have follow up titers after their initial vaccination series.

Transmission by fomites or contaminated hands is another potential way the virus can be nosocomially-acquired. Patients with influenza have led to nosocomial transmission of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>], and infected staff have transmitted the virus to patients and other staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Acquisition of influenza in medical staff results in absenteeism and disruption of health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. In addition, nosocomial outbreaks have been responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in nursing homes and other long-term facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/61-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-67</a>]. These problems can be reduced by vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. This was illustrated in a study in which patients in facilities where influenza immunization rates of staff were greater than 60 percent had less influenza-related morbidity and mortality than patients in facilities where less than 60 percent of the staff were vaccinated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Recommendation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since influenza infection in staff and patients is common, ranging between 25 and 80 percent, the CDC has published extensive guidelines for the prevention and control of nosocomial influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/19,70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,70-72</a>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians, American Public Health Association, Infectious Diseases Society of America, and Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America have all endorsed mandatory influenza vaccination for all health care workers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A central part of the prevention strategy is annual immunization (eg, between mid-October and mid-November) of health care providers, particularly clinicians, nurses, employees of nursing homes or other long-term health facilities who have contact with patients or residents, and providers of home care to high risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. In both adults and pediatric health care providers, influenza vaccine is cost-effective and, in one study, reduced absenteeism by 28 percent.</p><p>The ACIP recommends that the intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-virus-vaccine-live-attenuated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">live attenuated influenza vaccine</a> not be used during the 2016 to 2017 season for any population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].&nbsp;Prior to that, the ACIP recommended that health care providers caring for severely immunosuppressed individuals not receive the live attenuated vaccine, especially during the time of greatest immunosuppression (eg, during hospitalization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

The risk of acquiring measles in hospital personnel is estimated to be thirteen times greater than for the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>All three diseases are transmissible by the air-droplet route (and measles can also be transmitted by the airborne route) before the infected person has clinically recognizable illness.

Strict definitions of evidence of measles, mumps, and rubella immunity should be used. Serologic screening before immunization is generally not considered necessary for people who have documentation of appropriate vaccination or other acceptable evidence of immunity to measles, mumps, and rubella, such as laboratory confirmation of disease. Most individuals born prior to 1957 were likely infected naturally and can generally be presumed immune. However, for unvaccinated health care providers born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles or mumps immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease, vaccination with two doses of MMR given at least 28 days apart should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-health-care-providers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. During outbreaks of measles or mumps, such individuals should receive two doses of MMR vaccine.

Despite widespread use of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus immunization of children, the incidence of pertussis has been increasing.

This recommendation is applicable to health care personnel, but health care personnel should receive Tdap as soon as feasible, if they have not previously received this vaccine. Two Tdap vaccines are approved in the United States for adults under age 65: Boostrix&trade; and ADACEL&trade;. Because data are not available to evaluate the effectiveness of a single dose of Tdap for the prevention of secondary cases of pertussis, it is still recommended that exposed adults receive prophylaxis, as discussed elsewhere.

Due to the recognition of waning immunity in adults, documented nosocomial outbreaks, and the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, health care personnel who have direct patient contact should receive a single dose of Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis) as soon as feasible, if they have not previously received this vaccine.
