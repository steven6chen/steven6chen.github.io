Often it is called just &quot;incontinence.&quot;</p><p>Incontinence is a very common problem. If you have this problem, there are treatments that can help. There are also things you can do on your own to stop or reduce urine leakage so you don't have to &quot;just live with it.&quot; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H296280086\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of incontinence?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are different types of incontinence. Each causes different symptoms. The 3 most common types are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stress incontinence</strong> &ndash; People with stress incontinence leak urine when they laugh, cough, sneeze, or do anything that &quot;stresses&quot; the belly. Stress incontinence is most common in women, especially those who have had a baby.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urgency incontinence</strong> &ndash; People with urgency incontinence feel a strong need to urinate all of a sudden. Often the &quot;urge&quot; is so strong that they can't make it to the bathroom in time. &quot;Overactive bladder&quot; is another term for having a sudden, frequent urge to urinate. People with overactive bladder might or might not actually leak urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mixed incontinence</strong> &ndash; People with mixed incontinence have symptoms of both stress and urgency incontinence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H296280093\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Here are some steps that can help reduce urine leaks:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the amount of liquid you drink, especially a few hours before bed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cut down on any foods or drinks that make your symptoms worse. Some people find that alcohol, caffeine, or spicy or acidic foods irritate the bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are overweight, lose weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you take medicines called diuretics, plan ahead. These medicines increase the need to urinate. Take them when you know you will be near a bathroom for a few hours.</p><p/><p>These techniques can also help improve bladder control:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bladder retraining</strong> &ndash; During bladder retraining, you go to the bathroom at scheduled times. For instance, you might decide that you will go every hour. You would make yourself go every hour, even if you didn't feel like you needed to. And you would try to wait until a whole hour had passed if you needed to go sooner. Then, once you got used to going every hour, you would increase the amount of time you waited in between bathroom visits. Over time, you might be able to &quot;retrain&quot; your bladder to wait 3 or 4 hours between bathroom visits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pelvic muscle exercises</strong> &ndash; Pelvic muscle exercises strengthen the muscles that control the flow of urine. These exercises can help, but people often do them wrong. Ask your doctor or nurse how to do them right.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H296280100\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can find out what might be causing your incontinence. He or she can also suggest ways to relieve the problem.</p><p>When you speak to your doctor or nurse, ask if any of the medicines you take could be causing your symptoms. Some medicines can cause incontinence or make it worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H296280107\"><span class=\"h1\">How is incontinence treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment options differ depending on what type of incontinence you have, and whether you are a man or a woman. Some of the treatment options include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relax the bladder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to repair the tissues that support the bladder or to improve the flow of urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrical stimulation of the nerves that relax the bladder</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H296280114\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with incontinence can regain bladder control or at least reduce the amount of leakage they have. The key is to speak up about it to your doctor or nurse. Then work with him or her to find an approach that helps you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H296280121\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-enlarged-prostate-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-muscle-kegel-exercises-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pelvic muscle (Kegel) exercises (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-treatments-for-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence treatments for women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-floor-muscle-exercises-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
