The most important practice is the use of available measures to prevent such exposures. Although the incidence of needlestick injuries has been reduced by advances in education, needle disposal, engineering changes (eg, needleless devices, safety needles) and personnel protection, institutions and healthcare professionals must continue to assume responsibility in further lowering the risk.</p><p>The procedures to follow after HCP have had significant contact with body fluids from a patient infected with HIV are reviewed here. The epidemiology of bloodborne exposures in HCP, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requirements regarding infection control procedures and training in the United States, and the management of potential exposure to other bloodborne pathogens including hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus are also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection among healthcare providers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management and risks associated with nonoccupational exposure to HIV are discussed separately.

The risk is increased when the source has a high viral load, the volume is large, and the exposure is deep. The healthcare personnel (HCP) at highest risk are those who have percutaneously been inoculated with blood from an HIV-infected source. All known seroconversions have occurred with exposure to blood, bloody fluids, or viral cultures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28866473\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk by exposure type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of becoming infected with HIV after exposure to body fluids from an HIV-infected patient is low. In the United States, there were 58 confirmed and 150 possible cases of occupationally-acquired HIV reported to the Centers for Disease Control from 1985 to 2013; there was only one confirmed case from 2000 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>A review of prospective studies of seroconversion following occupational exposure to an HIV-infected source in the era before the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) found the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV transmission occurred in 20 of 6135 cases (0.33 percent) following percutaneous exposure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One case of HIV was transmitted out of 1143 exposures (0.09 percent) on the mucosa of HCP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no cases after 2712 intact skin exposures</p><p/><p>A similar frequency of HIV seroconversion after needlestick injury (0.36 percent) was found in a later report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Cooperative Needlestick Surveillance Group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and in another meta-analysis (0.23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The risk of HIV infection following an occupational mucosal exposure was subsequently estimated to be 0.03 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for seroconversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A CDC case-control study of needlestick injuries from an HIV-infected source in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy included 33 cases who seroconverted and 655 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The study found that the following factors, each of which presumably reflected exposure to a higher number of viral particles, increased the risk of acquiring HIV after a needlestick injury:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep injury (odds ratio [OR] 15)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device visibly contaminated with the patient's blood (OR 6.2)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Needle placement in a vein or artery (OR 4.3)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Terminal illness in the source patient (OR 5.6)</p><p/><p>The majority of cases were injured by a hollow bore as opposed to a solid needle. </p><p>The HIV load is another important risk factor for transmission based upon studies of sexual transmission in discordant couples and rates of perinatal transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Early studies in HCP did not directly address this issue because they were based upon data obtained before viral load measurement was routinely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. The observed correlation of transmission risk with a source with late-stage AIDS is thought to be a surrogate for high HIV viral load.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of exposure by profession</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nurses report the most frequent blood and body exposures (48.6 percent), followed by physicians who are residents or fellows (7.7 percent), attending physicians (7.7 percent), non-lab technologists (4.5 percent), respiratory therapists (3.6 percent), and certified nursing <span class=\"nowrap\">assistants/home</span> health aides (3.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In addition, long work hours and sleep deprivation among medical trainees result in fatigue, which is associated with a threefold increase in the risk of needle-stick injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A survey performed among 699 surgeons-in-training at 17 medical centers found that the mean number of needlestick injuries by the fifth (final) year of residency was 7.7 and that 99 percent of residents had at least one needlestick injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Furthermore, approximately one-half had a needlestick injury involving a high-risk patient, and more than half of the most recent injuries had not been reported; the most common reason was lack of time. Despite the concerning number of exposures in this study, there has never been a confirmed case of HIV transmitted to a surgeon through occupational exposure in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28866504\"><span class=\"h2\">Documented seroconversions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, 58 confirmed cases of occupationally-acquired HIV infection were reported to the CDC between 1985 and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. A confirmed case required documentation that seroconversion occurred in the context of an occupational exposure to an HIV-infected source. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of these cases, 49 workers sustained a percutaneous exposure <span class=\"nowrap\">(puncture/cut</span> injury), five had mucocutaneous exposures, two had both percutaneous and mucocutaneous exposures, and two had an unknown route of exposure. Forty-nine exposures were to blood from an HIV-infected source, one to visibly bloody fluid, four to an unspecified fluid, and four to concentrated virus in a laboratory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposed HCP were nurses (24), clinical laboratory technicians (16), nonsurgical physicians (6), and others (11). Twenty-six of these HCP developed the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There were no confirmed seroconversions in surgeons and no seroconversions after exposure from a suture needle.</p><p/><p>In addition, 150 cases of possible occupationally-acquired HIV infection occurred among HCP in the United States. These individuals lacked a documented workplace exposure, but their job responsibilities might have exposed them to HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In Europe, 35 documented seroconversions following occupational exposure and 85 possible occupationally acquired HIV infections were reported as of 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Cases of HIV seroconversion following occupational exposures are not systematically documented and reported in most other regions of the world.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28866693\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF TRANSMISSION OF OTHER BLOODBORNE PATHOGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to unvaccinated healthcare personnel or a vaccinated nonresponder is much higher than HIV. The risk of hepatitis C virus transmission from an infected source is about sixfold greater compared with HIV (1.8 versus 0.3 percent). Management of healthcare personnel exposed to these viruses, including post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis B virus, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection among healthcare providers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of healthcare personnel (HCP) immediately after a significant exposure to blood or body fluids from HIV-infected patients is critically important in reducing the likelihood of transmission and in insuring that the legal rights of the employee and the institution are upheld.</p><p>All institutions should have a readily available policy for managing serious exposures. In the US, such a policy is required and must comply with regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-and-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-among-healthcare-providers#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection among healthcare providers&quot;, section on 'Minimizing risk'</a>). The policy should be distributed to all employees and should be readily available in the Employee Health Service and the Emergency Department.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial actions following exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial response to any exposure of HCP to blood should be immediate cleansing of the exposed site. For skin exposures, the area should be washed with soap and water. Small wounds and punctures may be cleansed with an antiseptic such as an alcohol-based hand hygiene agent, since alcohol is virucidal to HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Other antiseptics such as iodophors, chloroxylenol (PCMX) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> (CHG) also inactivate HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>For mucosal surface exposure, the exposed mucus membranes should be flushed with copious amounts of water. Eyes should be irrigated with saline or water. There is no evidence that expressing fluid by squeezing the wound will further reduce the risk of bloodborne pathogen transmission. Guidelines for hand washing and infection control can be accessed through the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/Guidelines.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsdb6Rm17RL9ekVcdIbLJB6q4ZG6w7Deh448+NDW1+YWDyuj4Ekibe5N8S7dSQOjrgQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3764\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Documentation of the exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical information on the source patient for the exposure and the recipient HCP should be documented.

If testing in the source patient is delayed, PEP should still be initiated while awaiting test results. If the source is found to be HIV-negative, PEP should be discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H1087328\" class=\"local\">'Indications for prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>The CDC recommends routine HIV testing for persons 13 to 64 years of age, unless the patient &quot;opts out.&quot; The implication for healthcare personnel in the United States (US) is that it is now more likely that the source will have been tested. Some states in the US still require informed consent for HIV serologic testing, but many waive this requirement in the event of occupational exposure. </p><p>Clinicians should also be aware of rare case reports where the source patient tested HIV-seronegative and was later found to have primary HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]; these rare events do not alter guidelines for routine antibody testing but do highlight the importance of testing for HIV RNA if clinically indicated. It is important to be cautious in interpretation of low viral loads (&lt;5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">c/mL)</span> since these are often lab errors and patients with acute retroviral syndrome usually have very high viral loads. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling of healthcare personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk assessment is particularly important for HCP to make educated decisions about PEP since the consequences are great and the stress is extraordinary. They should also be well informed of the benefits and risks of PEP and of the importance of close follow-up. Specifically, the following issues should be discussed with exposed HCP: </p><p>HCP should be informed of the risk associated with the specific exposure experienced. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk of transmission of HIV'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With percutaneous or sharps injuries from an HIV-infected source, the risk of HIV infection averages <span class=\"nowrap\">3/1000,</span> but varies greatly depending on the inoculum size (source viral load and volume of blood), the depth of penetration, and exposure to a hollow bore versus suture needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure of source blood to intact skin is considered &quot;no risk&quot;. There are no confirmed cases of HIV transmission in HCP with skin abrasions, cuts, sores, or other breaches in skin integrity, but a theoretical risk is estimated at <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All documented transmissions have involved source blood, bloody body fluids, or laboratory cultures of HIV.

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Post-exposure prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect evidence shows that post-exposure prophylaxis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> alone can reduce the risk of HIV infection. Current multidrug regimens are likely much more effective in preventing infection. However, even when properly provided, PEP does not assure complete prevention of HIV infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal is to initiate PEP within one to two hours of exposure; the benefit of PEP is diminished with each hour delay in initiation. PEP is typically not recommended after a delay of more than 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several options exist for PEP, and side effects are an important consideration. </p><p/><p>Risk reduction strategies should be employed to prevent transmission of HIV should the HCP acquire infection. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the event of HIV infection post-exposure, the greatest risk of transmission to other individuals is in the first 6 to 12 weeks. Exposed HCP should be instructed on measures to reduce the potential risk of HIV transmission to others. This usually means condom use or abstinence from sex and refraining from blood, plasma, organ, tissue, and semen donation until the six-month serologic test is negative. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no need to modify a healthcare provider&rsquo;s patient-care responsibilities after an exposure.</p><p/><p>Follow-up is important to identify HIV infection or adverse effects of the PEP regimen, if administered.

There is no single preferred approach. One option is for temporary discontinuation of breastfeeding following exposure until the last follow-up serologic test is negative. Alternatively, if a woman chooses to continue breastfeeding, it is not a contraindication to PEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The majority of individuals who seroconvert will do so within the first three months. Testing should be performed even among those who receive PEP. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Selection of antiretroviral therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>All exposed individuals should have a baseline HIV test immediately after the exposure. The frequency and duration of follow-up testing depends upon the type of HIV test being used. A fourth generation antibody-antigen test is preferred since this test will detect seroconversion earlier. If this assay is used, follow-up testing should be performed at six weeks and four months after the exposure. If a third generation antibody test is used, repeat HIV testing should occur at six weeks, three months, and six months following the exposure. A detailed discussion on the different types of HIV assays is found elsewhere.

There were 33 cases (HCP who became infected with HIV) and 665 controls (HCP who did not become infected). Risk factors for seroconversion were deep injury, injury by device with visible blood contamination, injury with needle from source blood vessel, and terminal illness in the source. In a multivariate analysis controlling for these risk factors, cases were significantly less likely to have taken <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> after exposure than controls (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.06-0.52). This study has several methodological limitations including retrospective design, heterogeneity of data source, and small number of events. Nevertheless, the cumulative data from this study in addition to the results from other prevention models (eg, studies of HIV perinatal transmission and PEP in primates) overall support the efficacy of PEP. </p><p>The mechanism by which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> prevents HIV transmission is incompletely understood.

It is known that older PEP regimens that included zidovudine were not perfect, since there have been at least six reported cases of HCP who contracted HIV infection despite receiving a zidovudine-containing combination regimen within two hours of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

If the HIV status of the source patient is unknown, we offer PEP while awaiting HIV testing if the source has risk factors for HIV infection (eg, injection drug users, men who have sex with men) or symptoms suggesting HIV infection. If the source patient is unknown, we do not administer PEP unless the exposure occurred in a setting where exposure to HIV is likely (eg, a needlestick from a sharps container in an HIV clinic).</p><p>In all cases, the decision to administer PEP must weigh the risk of infection with HIV against the toxicity and inconvenience of PEP.

The goal is to start within one to two hours (or earlier) after exposure, often using a &quot;starter pack&quot; with appropriate drugs that are immediately available. It is likely that a delay in initiating PEP can reduce efficacy. This concept is supported in primate models of PEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. </p><p>For most HCP, we do not initiate PEP if more than 72 hours have elapsed after the initial exposure; PEP is likely to be less effective when administered after that period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, we offer three-drug PEP after a longer interval to patients with a very high-risk exposure (eg, sharps injuries from a needle that was in an artery or vein of an HIV-infected source patient). For such HCP, The United States Public Health Services suggests that PEP can be offered up to one week after the exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of antiretroviral therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H986399\"><span class=\"h3\">Preferred antiretroviral regimens for PEP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest a three-drug regimen for all HCP who opt for PEP.

Standard PEP regimens may be inappropriate when the source is infected with a strain of HIV that is known or is likely to be resistant to antiretroviral medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although there are no studies examining this issue, it is appropriate to tailor a regimen by selecting antiretroviral medications to which the source HIV is believed to be sensitive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-hiv-drug-resistance-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of HIV drug resistance testing&quot;</a>.) </p><p>However, PEP should <strong>not </strong>be delayed if information on resistance testing is unavailable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this situation, PEP regimens should include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> or ritonavir-boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a>, and the regimen can be modified if needed when resistance testing is completed. These complex cases are best managed by an experienced HIV provider or with assistance from the HIV help-line (888-448-4911). If no resistance testing is available, an HIV specialist can often predict which mutations are likely to be present if the source patient has virologic failure on the current regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This is particularly helpful since results from resistance testing performed after exposure will not be available soon enough to affect the choice of PEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

PEP should <strong>not</strong> be delayed pending the source&rsquo;s HIV test results, especially in areas where HIV is firmly established in the general population (eg, HIV prevalence consistently exceeding 1 percent among pregnant women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-healthcare-personnel-exposed-to-hiv/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In such settings, it should be presumed that sources with an unknown HIV status pose a risk of infection. The WHO guidelines suggest a three-drug regimen using tenofovir-emtricitabine as the preferred NRTI combination and a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (lopinavir or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a>) as the third agent.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-or-body-fluid-exposure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Blood or body fluid exposure (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk to healthcare personnel (HCP) of contracting HIV from exposure to body fluids from an HIV-infected patient is very low. The average risk of seroconversion after a needlestick injury is about 3 per 1000 with no prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk of transmission of HIV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first response to a percutaneous exposure should be to wash the area thoroughly with soap and water; for punctures and small lacerations, cleaning the area with an alcohol-based hand hygiene agent is reasonable. Exposed mucous membranes should be irrigated copiously with water or saline. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Initial actions following exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCP should report exposures promptly to obtain HIV screening for both the HCP and the source patient (according to institution guidelines), and to discuss the need for post-exposure prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Documentation of the exposure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the stress and emotional impact of an occupational exposure to HIV, explicit counseling on the actual risk of the exposure and the benefits and disadvantage of post-exposure prophylaxis is important. Exposed HCP should also be instructed on reducing the risk of potential transmission of HIV and means of monitoring for seroconversion. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Counseling of healthcare personnel'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV screening of the exposed individual should be performed at baseline. The frequency and duration of follow-up testing depends upon the type of HIV test being used. A fourth generation antibody-antigen test is preferred since this will detect seroconversion earlier. If this assay is used, follow-up testing should be performed at six weeks and four months after the exposure. If a third generation antibody test is used, repeat HIV testing should occur at six weeks, three months, and six months following exposure. (See <a href=\"#H218540\" class=\"local\">'Testing for HIV'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For HCP with a percutaneous, mucous membrane, or nonintact skin exposure to potentially infectious body fluids from a patient with known HIV infection, we offer post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). In all cases, the decision to administer PEP must weigh the risk of infection with HIV against the toxicity and inconvenience of PEP. If the source patient cannot be identified, we do not give PEP unless the exposure occurred in a setting where the source is likely to be HIV-infected (eg, a needlestick from a sharps container in an HIV clinic). (See <a href=\"#H1087328\" class=\"local\">'Indications for prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the decision is made to administer post-exposure prophylaxis, it should be started as early as possible after an exposure (ideally within one to two hours). We administer PEP while awaiting the results of HIV testing if the HIV status of the source patient is unknown and the source patient has risk factors for being HIV-infected. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For HCP who are offered and agree to take PEP, we suggest a three rather than a two-drug regimen, regardless of the severity of the exposure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We typically use tenofovir-emtricitabine combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>. Alternative regimens that are also acceptable are tenofovir-emtricitabine combined with ritonavir-boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atazanavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atazanavir</a>, or ritonavir-boosted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a>. We prefer ritonavir-boosted darunavir as it may be better tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Selection of antiretroviral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the source is HIV-infected and receiving a failing regimen, the choice of regimen is best made in consultation with an HIV expert. For pregnant HCP who have an occupational exposure to HIV and choose to initiate post-exposure prophylaxis, we typically use tenofovir-emtricitabine plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-and-lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine-lamivudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Efavirenz</a> should not be used for PEP in women who are or might be pregnant. In the US, assistance with choosing a regimen can be obtained by calling the National Clinicians' Post-exposure Prophylaxis Hotline (PEPline) at 888-448-4911. (See <a href=\"#H986438\" class=\"local\">'Specific populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is recommended that post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) be continued for four weeks, although the duration needed to achieve maximal benefit is not known. PEP should be discontinued if testing shows that the source patient is HIV-negative. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People receiving post-exposure prophylaxis should be monitored for adverse reactions to the drugs and for drug interactions.
