From studies done after 1960, we learned that the dictum &ldquo;once a cesarean, always cesarean&rdquo; no longer applies. It appears that many women who have previously undergone cesarean delivery can safely attempt a trial of labor to have a vaginal delivery in subsequent pregnancies.</p><p>The following are important definitions regarding vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) delivery: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) is a planned attempt to labor by a woman who has previously undergone a cesarean delivery and desires a subsequent vaginal delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A VBAC is a &ldquo;successful&rdquo; trial of labor resulting in a vaginal birth. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A TOLAC may result in either a &ldquo;successful&rdquo; VBAC or a &ldquo;failed&rdquo; trial of labor resulting in a repeat cesarean delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A repeat cesarean delivery (RCD) may be planned and scheduled beforehand and thus is an elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD). If the woman who plans an ERCD enters spontaneous labor before the scheduled date, this is still considered an ERCD even if delivery is unscheduled. The woman with a failed TOLAC undergoes a RCD that is unplanned and unscheduled.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS OF VAGINAL BIRTH AFTER CESAREAN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) resulting in a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shorter length of hospital stay and postpartum recovery (in most cases)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer complications, such as postpartum fever, wound or uterine infection, thromboembolism (blood clots in the leg or lung), need for blood transfusion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer neonatal breathing problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS OF VAGINAL BIRTH AFTER CESAREAN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risks of an attempted VBAC or TOLAC include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk of failed trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) without a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) resulting in repeat cesarean delivery (RCD) in about 20 to 40 percent of women who attempt VBAC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk of rupture of uterus resulting in an emergency cesarean delivery. The risk of uterine rupture may be related in part to the type of uterine incision made during the first cesarean delivery. A previous transverse uterine incision has the lowest risk of rupture (0.2 to 1.5 percent risk). Vertical or T-shaped uterine incisions have a higher risk of uterine rupture (4 to 9 percent risk) [1]. It is important to remember that the direction of the skin incision does not indicate the type or direction of the uterine incision; a woman with a transversal (bikini) skin incision may have a vertical uterine incision. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While women who attempt TOLAC and VBAC have a low risk of uterine rupture, the risk of uterine rupture is higher with VBAC than with RCD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of fetal death is very low with both VBAC and elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD), but the likelihood of fetal death is higher with VBAC than with ERCD. Maternal death is very rare with either type of delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO SHOULD CONSIDER A TOLAC AND VBAC?</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) suggest that a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) to attempt a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is an acceptable option for a woman who has undergone one prior cesarean delivery with a low transverse uterine incision, assuming there are no other conditions that would normally require a cesarean delivery (as an example, placenta previa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-delivery-vbac-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACOG further suggests that a woman with two prior low transverse uterine incisions, or a woman with a twin pregnancy, or a woman who requires induction of labor may also be considered candidates for VBAC with appropriate counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-delivery-vbac-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TOLAC with anticipated VBAC should be attempted only in those facilities capable of performing emergency cesarean deliveries and, thus, those with an appropriate nursing staff, anesthesia team, operating room, and obstetrician or other surgeon immediately available in case an emergency cesarean delivery becomes necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A woman considering VBAC should discuss with her health-care provider the risks and benefits of VBAC versus an elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD) and the discussion should include plans for intervention in case of uterine rupture or another indication for an emergency cesarean delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Management during labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many ways, a woman who attempts VBAC is managed similarly to other women anticipating a vaginal delivery. A fetal monitor may be used to observe the baby's heart rate and monitor for early signs of fetal distress. Medications to induce labor or improve contractions (eg, oxytocin [Pitocin]) are used cautiously since they can increase the risk of uterine rupture. If problems occur during labor, a cesarean delivery will likely be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">VBAC SUCCESS RATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, 60 to 80 percent of women who are considered candidates for a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) to attempt vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) will have a successful vaginal birth (VBAC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-delivery-vbac-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Factors that increase the chances for a successful VBAC in an individual woman include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A previous vaginal delivery, especially a previous VBAC</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous onset of labor (labor is not induced)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal progress of labor, including dilation and effacement (thinning) of the cervix</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior cesarean delivery performed because the baby's position was abnormal (breech)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only one prior cesarean delivery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prior cesarean delivery was performed early in labor, and not after full cervical dilatation</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=6727\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
