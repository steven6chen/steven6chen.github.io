ID is heterogeneous in etiology and encompasses a broad spectrum of functioning, disability, needs, and strengths.ID affects approximately 1 percent of the population. It is an important public health issue because of its prevalence and the need for extensive support services. Its management requires early diagnosis and intervention, coupled with access to health care and appropriate supports.</p><p>The definition and diagnosis of ID, including assessment of needs for support, are reviewed here. Other aspects of ID are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Management, outcomes, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385880598\"><span class=\"h2\">Intellectual disability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ID is a neurodevelopmental disorder that begins in childhood and is characterized by limitations in both intelligence and adaptive skills with at least one of three adaptive domains (conceptual, social, and practical) affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90174%7EPEDS%2F95384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90174 graphicRef95384 \">table 1A-B</a>). The term replaces and improves upon the older term of &quot;mental retardation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A variety of other terms are used outside of the United States to describe ID (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57206 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Two definitions are commonly used in the United States. One is published by the American Psychological Association (APA), in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5<sup>th</sup> edition (DSM-5), and the other by the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD). Although these definitions differed substantially in the past, current versions are similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Standardized intelligence quotient testing is no longer used to classify severity of impairment in ID.</p><p>ID is characterized by significant limitations in <strong>both</strong> of the following, with onset during the developmental period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (or before 18 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adaptive behavior</strong> &ndash; Limitations in adaptive functioning are linked to underlying intellectual impairment and affect participation in multiple settings, such as home, community, and school. Adaptive deficits include limitations in at least <strong>one</strong> of three domains: conceptual, social, and practical (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90174%7EPEDS%2F95384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90174 graphicRef95384 \">table 1A-B</a>). Ongoing support is required as compared with others in the same age group. The severity of ID is defined according to the level of supports needed in each of these domains. (See <a href=\"#H27915551\" class=\"local\">'Adaptive function'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intellectual functioning</strong> &ndash; Limitations in general mental capacity (intelligence) including learning, reasoning, and problem solving, abstract thinking, and judgment. This limitation in intellectual ability typically corresponds to an intelligence quotient (IQ) that is 2 standard deviations or more below the mean; scores are typically less than 65 to 75. Although standardized IQ testing remains pertinent to the descriptive diagnostic profile, it is no longer used to classify the severity of impairment in ID. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Intellectual function'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The above definition of ID assumes that limitations in function must be assessed relative to the child's age, experience, and environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, a valid assessment of adaptive and intellectual functioning considers differences in language and culture, as well as those in communication, motor, sensory, and behavioral factors. It is important to note that individuals with ID often have strengths as well as limitations. Defining ID severity by the level of support needed for adaptive functioning is valuable because appropriate individualized support usually will improve the life functioning of a person with ID. In addition, the combination of adaptive and intellectual function is more predictive of outcomes than intellectual function alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259161892\"><span class=\"h2\">Syndromic versus nonsyndromic ID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ID may be further categorized as syndromic or nonsyndromic ID. The term syndromic ID is applied when a child presents with ID in addition to one or more clinical abnormalities or comorbidities of a known syndrome. The term nonsyndromic ID is usually applied when a child presents with ID alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The distinction between the two categories is not always clear cut if the associated clinical abnormalities are subtle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Global developmental delay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Global developmental delay (GDD) is the preferred term to describe intellectual and adaptive impairment in children &lt;5 years old who fail to meet expected developmental milestones in several areas of intellectual functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Not all children with GDD will meet criteria for ID as they grow older. The term ID usually is applied to children &ge;5 years old, when the clinical severity of impairment is more reliably assessed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167151114\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167159851\"><span class=\"h2\">Presenting symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with ID usually are brought to the attention of a pediatrician because of parental concerns of language delay, immature behavior and play, immature self-help skills, or difficulty in learning. Parents may first recognize delayed development when a younger sibling overtakes an older child in these skills. In other cases, the clinician may be alerted to the possibility of ID when a child fails to meet expected developmental milestones during developmental surveillance and screening.</p><p>Children with severe ID tend to come to medical attention earlier than those with mild ID. Most severely affected children are recognized before two years of age, whereas some children with mild ID may be undetected until school age. Individuals with a known genetic disorder and those presenting with obvious dysmorphic features and microcephaly may be diagnosed in infancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microcephaly-in-infants-and-children-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microcephaly in infants and children: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most children with severe intellectual impairment will present with language delay. Language development is considered a reasonably good indicator of future intelligence in a child without hearing impairment. Thus, language delay associated with global developmental delay (GDD) suggests cognitive impairment. This should be distinguished from isolated familial expressive language delay (without other deficits), which has a more favorable prognosis. In contrast, gross motor skills in children with ID are often less significantly delayed than intellectual and adaptive function, except when neuromuscular abnormalities result in delay. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-speech-and-language-disorders-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of speech and language disorders in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=expressive-language-delay-late-talking-in-young-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Expressive language delay (&quot;late talking&quot;) in young children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167151304\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the severity of ID increases, other conditions are more likely to be associated. Common problems that occur in children with severe or profound ID include medical conditions, neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and other behavioral disorders, and obesity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82409940\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical conditions commonly associated with ID include seizure disorders, motor impairment affecting gross, fine, and speech motor functions, structural abnormalities, dysmorphism, and vision, hearing, and other sensory impairments. In some cases, these other morbidities are the presenting features, while in others they may be unrecognized. Comorbid endocrine abnormalities may also be present, such as abnormal thyroid function, short stature, and growth hormone deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Individuals with ID have greater rates of overweight and obesity as compared with typically developing peers. Obesity in ID poses significant health risk which increases with age. Risk factors that predispose to obesity include altered or inappropriate eating habits, underlying genetic syndromes, less physical activity, chronic health conditions, and psychotropic medication use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-management-outcomes-and-prevention#H82408915\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Management, outcomes, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Monitoring for associated disorders'</a>.)</p><p>When a genetic cause is identified, the clinician should evaluate the patient for known associated conditions (eg, hypothyroidism in patients with Down syndrome). Such comorbidities may require specific management and also may alter the approach to diagnostic testing for ID (if they affect optimal participation or require test modification).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167151327\"><span class=\"h3\">Other neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other neurodevelopmental disorders in addition to ID affect approximately 30 to 70 percent of children with ID, occurring five times more often than in children without ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, these associated disorders may be underdiagnosed in ID because developmental delay (especially poor language skills), medical problems, and <span class=\"nowrap\">personal/family</span> circumstances make it challenging to apply the diagnostic behavioral criteria described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5<sup>th</sup> edition (DSM&ndash;5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These neurodevelopmental disorders adversely affect functioning, quality of life, and adaptation. Individuals with cognitive and adaptive impairments are more likely to have behavioral and emotional problems; however, some of these may not necessarily meet diagnostic criteria for a specific mental health disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Neurodevelopmental disorders associated with ID are reviewed in the practice parameter of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autism</strong> &ndash; Autism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may occur with ID. The disordered social and communication skills that characterize ASD must be distinguished from the developmentally delayed social and communication skills that typically affect children with ID. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Impaired social communication and interaction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, intelligence quotient (IQ) scores may be less stable where both ID and autism are present, particularly in young children. In one study, 28 percent of children with ID had comorbid autistic disorder, and half of these cases were not diagnosed during routine care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Autistic disorder occurs more commonly in syndromic ID (eg, in 25 to 47 percent of those with fragile X syndrome, 5 to 10 percent of those with Down syndrome); individuals with tuberous sclerosis, Angelman syndrome, Rett syndrome, Joubert syndrome, and Cohen syndrome are also more likely to have comorbid autism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ADHD</strong> &ndash; Some children with ID also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD must be distinguished from situational inattentiveness at school due to demands that may be too high, inability to comprehend and follow rules and expectations, or the effect of medication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H341279665\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Learning disabilities</strong> &ndash; Varied difficulties in general and academic learning commonly occur with ID; these are pertinent to consider in each individual even if they are attributed to the underlying cause of the ID. For example, phonological difficulties frequently cause reading deficits in individuals with mild ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A <em>specific</em> learning disorder may be identified in addition to ID when a specific learning function is disproportionately affected, beyond expected for the child's ID profile, and not considered due to the underlying ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eating disorders</strong> &ndash; Associated eating disorders include pica (eating substances that are not food) and rumination (regurgitation of undigested food into the mouth, during or shortly after eating). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H262926961\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pica'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H262926980\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Rumination disorder'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Depression and anxiety</strong> &ndash; Depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common comorbid conditions. Depression may be manifested as aggressive or irritable externalizing behaviors. Depression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anxiety can be triggered by relocation, caregiver changes, and effects of medication (eg, beta blockers, neuroleptic drugs) or associated conditions (eg, hypothyroidism). It may be difficult to assess children with ID for these problems due to limited communication skills. Children with ID are at increased risk of suicidal ideation and for substance abuse. Screening for these problems is advised.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical and sexual abuse</strong> &ndash; Children with ID are at increased risk of being maltreated, victimized, manipulated, neglected, and abused, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. They may be vulnerable to abuse because of cognitive, learning, and communication deficits, gullibility, social naivet&eacute;, dependence on others, and the desire to please. Up to 14 percent of patients with ID admitted to hospitals have reported abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Estimates of the prevalence of sexual abuse among children with ID range from 15 to 30 percent; however, sexual abuse may be under-identified in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Female adolescents and children with mild ID (compared with more severely affected children) are at greatest risk of being sexually abused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Individuals with ID are more likely to experience frequent and persistent abuse, multiple abusers, and greater involvement of unfamiliar or non-family perpetrators compared with those without ID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, perpetrators are most commonly a male member of the immediate or extended family or a peer residing in the same living facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Children with ID who have suffered sexual abuse are also at greater risk of becoming a perpetrator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Abuse may cause other behavioral disorders, such as conduct disorder, PTSD, and depression. Sensitivity and a high index of suspicion for abuse are needed. Despite communication deficits, adolescents with severe ID often are able to disclose their victimization and abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Physical and sexual abuse and maltreatment in children and adolescents are discussed in greater detail in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child neglect and emotional maltreatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Movement disorders</strong> &ndash; Stereotyped behaviors, stimulating movement and motor mannerisms, including tic disorders, are common in severe ID. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Stereotypies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Self-injurious behaviors</strong> &ndash; Self-injurious behavior frequently occurs and may suggest syndromes such as Lesch-Nyhan. Self-injurious and aggressive behaviors can also occur in individuals who have limited communication who are experiencing stress, depression, or anxiety, or may result from side effects of sedative-hypnotic and neuroleptic medications.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167150642\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developmental surveillance should be performed at well-child visits with targeted screening at selected visits (9, 18, and 24 or 30 months), and whenever a parent or provider raises developmental concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The goal is early identification of children with possible developmental delay or ID and prompt referral for further evaluation and early intervention services. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-behavioral-surveillance-and-screening-in-primary-care#H3032665328\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care&quot;, section on 'Choice of screening test'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167150648\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developmental and behavioral screening is performed using standardized screening tools. The available tools vary in their sensitivity and specificity. Commonly used screening tools are summarized in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116108%7EPEDS%2F116107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116108 graphicRef116107 \">table 3A-B</a>). Additional details about these tests, including their accuracy in identifying infants or children with developmental delays, are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-behavioral-surveillance-and-screening-in-primary-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167150654\"><span class=\"h2\">Detailed evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a screening test suggests developmental delay, further evaluation is needed. This includes a focused history and physical examination that elicits characteristics that suggest a specific cause of the ID, and examines for possible co-morbidities or associated conditions. The history should incorporate a three-generation family pedigree. The evaluation also includes a comprehensive developmental assessment, including standardized testing of intellectual and adaptive functioning and assessment of behaviors. Evaluations should apply both assessment tools and clinical judgment to establish the diagnosis of ID and to evaluate the child's needs for support and services. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intellectual-disability-in-children-evaluation-for-a-cause\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intellectual disability in children: Evaluation for a cause&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of ID and needs assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>A multidisciplinary approach is recommended, while still stressing the importance of the medical home and collaboration with the family. Throughout the evaluation, it is important to use skilled professional communication and allow sufficient time for the interview, to elicit parent concerns, provide genetic counseling, and convey sufficient information to enable optimal understanding and informed collaborative decision-making with the child's parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral to a developmental pediatrician, pediatric neurologist, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychologist is usually needed, for a comprehensive neurodevelopmental evaluation. This includes cognitive-adaptive and behavioral assessments to determine the need for intellectual, adaptive and behavioral supports. A comprehensive school-based evaluation can also help determine educational needs and generate individual support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speech, language, communication, and adaptive functioning should be formally assessed. Adaptive functions are assessed in three domains of conceptual, social, and practical functioning, so as to identify what ongoing supports are needed individually.

The severity of ID is also defined by the degree of impairment in adaptive functioning, rather than by an intelligence quotient (IQ) score. Although both intellectual and adaptive impairment measures are pertinent in describing ID, impaired adaptive functions are more likely to be the presenting feature of ID than low IQ; impaired adaptive skills that affect activities of daily living and the child's ability to respond to common situations are more readily perceived than impaired intellectual functioning.</p><p>The diagnosis of ID requires impaired functioning in at least <strong>one</strong> of the following three domains, affecting participation in multiple settings (eg, home, community <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> school) and requiring ongoing support (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90174\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90174 \">table 1A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conceptual domain</strong> &ndash; These skills include language, reading, and writing (literacy); money, time, and number concepts (mathematics); reasoning; memory; self-direction; and judgment in novel situations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Social domain</strong> &ndash; These skills include interpersonal social communication, empathy, ability to relate to peers as friends, and social problem-solving.

Further skills may include following a schedule or routine, using a telephone, managing money, preparing meals, occupational skills, and abilities in <span class=\"nowrap\">transportation/travel,</span> health care, and safety.</p><p/><p>Both clinical assessment and individualized standardized testing are used to delineate adaptive functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Impaired function is defined by a score or performance at least 2 standard deviations below the mean on a standardized test assessing these domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The symptoms of adaptive impairment need to have begun during child development. The severity of the ID is defined according to the supports that are needed in each of these domains of adaptive functioning. The &quot;support intensity&quot; may vary from intermittent to pervasive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Standardized assessment tools using established developmental criteria are available to measure adaptive function and provide a general or total adaptive composite score, as well as adaptive domain scores or subscale measures. Tools vary in the adaptive domains, functions, and skills that are measured and in the reliability of scores within adaptive domains. The most commonly used tool is the parent-reported Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (the Vineland-III is the most recent version, although the Vineland-II is also widely used), which can be administered in English or Spanish.</p><p>Other tools include the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD)'s Diagnostic Adaptive Behavior Scale (DABS), the Woodcock-Johnson Scales of Independent Behavior-Revised (SIB-R), and the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System (ABAS-3<sup>rd</sup> Edition, or ABAS-III).</p><p>The instrument that is used to measure adaptive functioning must be appropriate for the child's age, gender, socioeconomic, experience, culture, and disability profile, and the results must be interpreted accordingly. As an example, normative values on an adaptive scale may be invalidated by a child's disability or medical condition. The assessment must also be appropriate for chronological and developmental age, as not all adaptive skills are applicable to young children. The instrument needs to be able to identify adaptive impairment as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5<sup>th</sup> edition (DSM-5) criteria in order for an ID diagnosis to be made. The ability to detect the impairment of a single adaptive domain (ie, conceptual, social, or practical) is necessary for applying the DSM-5 criteria to children whose adaptive impairment is limited to one domain. Adaptive impairments should impact multiple settings, limiting the child's participation. Clinical assessment and interpretation are vital to the adaptive assessment of an individual with ID.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Intellectual function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to impaired adaptive functioning as described above, the diagnosis of ID requires the presence of impaired intellectual functioning, which includes learning, reasoning, and problem solving, abstract thinking, and judgment. Both clinical assessment and individualized standardized testing are required to confirm deficits in intellectual functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The degree of impairment in intellectual function that is consistent with a diagnosis of ID typically corresponds to an IQ less than 65 to 75.</p><p>An IQ score provides a useful description of a child's ID. However, the IQ score is no longer applied as the diagnostic measure of severity, and is not used alone to drive clinical or legal decision-making. Moreover, IQ determination alone is an imprecise measure of a child's true intellectual abilities. The intellectual profile obtained by comprehensive developmental assessment is frequently more helpful than a composite or global IQ score, and generates a better description of individual strengths, and impaired functions that need intervention.</p><p>Because the diagnosis of ID requires both intellectual and adaptive deficits, a child with an IQ less than 70 unaccompanied by an adaptive deficit would not be considered to have ID, while one with an IQ between 70 and 75 that is accompanied by significant adaptive deficit would be diagnosed with ID. Although most children with an IQ less than 70 have adaptive deficits, their adaptive skills may improve with appropriate interventions; over time, they may no longer meet the severity of adaptive impairment criteria needed for an ID diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57042672\"><span class=\"h3\">Standardized intelligence tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intellectual function is typically measured by the administration of standardized tests to compare measured performance to that expected for age. The most commonly used tests for children are the Wechsler Scales. The instrument used for testing intellectual function must be appropriate for the child's level of adaptive function. In order to be valid, the test must take into account the child's age, culture, language, socioeconomic status, and profile of motor, sensory, and communication functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The Bayley Scales are widely used as a standardized test of infant mental and psychomotor development from 1 to 42 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The Griffiths scales, revised in 1996, are widely used internationally for the standardized comprehensive evaluation of children 0 to 24 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Griffith's criteria have been restandardized, extended, and revised for children from zero to eight years old; the Griffiths-III (restandardized in 2015) will enable continuous use in children from 1 to 71 months of age (5 years 11 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The Griffiths criteria are applicable for low functioning infants or children with global developmental delay or ID, including those with severe or profound impairment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57042678\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation and limitations of IQ testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate interpretation of the results is essential. An intelligence quotient (IQ) score that is at least 2 standard deviations below the mean indicates significant intellectual impairment. The standard error of measurement is approximately five points, although it varies with the instrument used. This means that for a child whose Wechsler-derived IQ score is 70, the true IQ may range from 65 to 75.</p><p>Global IQ scores may be invalid if there are highly discrepant scores on the subtests. IQs derived from different tests are not interchangeable because of differences in the measurement error and the particular skills that are tested. Another limitation is that a child's test results may change over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As a result, while they provide information about abilities measured at the time of the test, they are not necessarily an accurate measurement of a child's long-term potential. IQ measures are less valid at lower values, and out-of-date norms falsely inflate scores (&quot;Flynn effect&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17922307\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification of severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ID is highly heterogeneous and comprises a diverse spectrum of functioning, strengths, weaknesses, impairments, disabilities, and needs, it is helpful to recognize categories of severity when assessing needs for supports. The severity of ID is currently defined according to the level of support needed to address impaired adaptive functioning in one or more settings (eg, school, home, work). The DSM-5 describes characteristic impairments in ID that affect one or more adaptive domains (conceptual, social, or practical), and categorizes levels of severity within a range of mild to profound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95384 \">table 1B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The AAIDD uses a scheme that is similar except that it classifies severity by describing the supports needed as intermittent, limited, extensive, and pervasive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In the past, ID severity was categorized based on intellectual functioning alone, using the following ranges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intellectual-disability-in-children-definition-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-needs/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild &ndash; IQ between 50 to 55 and 70</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate &ndash; IQ between 35 to 40 and 50 to 55</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe &ndash; IQ between 20 to 25 and 35 to 40</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Profound &ndash; IQ less than 20 to 25</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16494921\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intellectual disability (ID) is characterized by significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in adaptive functioning that affect everyday social, conceptual, and practical functioning, with onset in childhood (before 18 years of age). The term is preferred over the former term, mental retardation. (See <a href=\"#H385880598\" class=\"local\">'Intellectual disability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Global developmental delay (GDD) is the term applied to children under five years of age who fail to meet expected developmental milestones and have significant impairments in several areas of intellectual functioning. Not all children with GDD will meet criteria for ID as they grow older. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Global developmental delay'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of ID and the severity of impairment affect when and how a child presents with ID. Children with severe ID present earlier than those with mild ID. Most children with intellectual impairment present with language delay and disorder or delay in other developmental domains. Gross motor skills in affected children are often relatively preserved. (See <a href=\"#H167151114\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems that are commonly associated with most severely affected children with ID include seizure disorders, motor impairments, and vision, hearing, and other sensory impairments, as well as neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression and anxiety, and self-stimulating or self-injurious behaviors. Children with ID are also at increased risk of being victimized or abused. (See <a href=\"#H167151304\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of standardized tests are available to screen development and behavior for features of GDD or ID and their frequently associated conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116108%7EPEDS%2F116107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116108 graphicRef116107 \">table 3A-B</a>). When a screening test suggests developmental delay, further evaluation is needed. Evaluation for ID includes a comprehensive developmental assessment, including standardized testing of intellectual and adaptive functioning and assessment of behaviors. These assessments are used to establish the diagnosis of ID and to evaluate the child's needs for supports and services. (See <a href=\"#H167150648\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H167150654\" class=\"local\">'Detailed evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ID is diagnosed when there are significant deficits in <strong>both</strong> intellectual and adaptive function, which are measured using clinical assessment and standardized tests. The adaptive deficits are directly associated with the underlying intellectual impairment. Selection of the appropriate testing instruments depends on the child's age, gender, culture, language, socioeconomic status, and neurodevelopmental profile including motor, sensory, and communication functioning. (See <a href=\"#H385880598\" class=\"local\">'Intellectual disability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tests of adaptive function are used to assess for deficits in conceptual skills, social skills, and practical daily living skills (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90174\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90174 \">table 1A</a>). A diagnosis of ID requires impaired functioning in at least one of these domains, across multiple environments, requiring ongoing support. (See <a href=\"#H27915551\" class=\"local\">'Adaptive function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The severity of ID is defined by the degree of impairment in adaptive functioning rather than by intellectual function or IQ score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95384 \">table 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17922307\" class=\"local\">'Classification of severity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For tests of intellectual function, significantly impaired intellect is considered when IQ scores are 2 standard deviations below the mean or more, with values typically less than 70. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Intellectual function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of a child for underlying causes of ID is discussed in a separate topic review.
