As a result, more elderly individuals are presenting to emergency departments following trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, advances in the care of chronic diseases have increased the number of elderly people with active lifestyles, which predispose them to injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Although trauma remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality across all ages, geriatric patients differ significantly from their younger counterparts in their greater number of comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], and higher risk of severe disability and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Elder patients are more susceptible to injury from minor mechanisms and less able to compensate from any injury. To manage their chronic ailments, elder patients are more likely to take multiple medications, some of which may blunt their response to the physiologic stress of trauma and increase their risk for complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>This topic will review important issues involved in the initial assessment and management of trauma in elder patients. Detailed discussions of trauma care in the adult and of the management of specific injuries are found separately.

One large observational study showed increased mortality, adjusted for injury severity, starting at age 70, suggesting this age is an appropriate cutoff for defining the elder population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As most studies use 65 as the threshold to define the geriatric patient (albeit often without providing evidence to support the choice), we too will use this age for the purposes of the following discussion. </p><p>It is likely more important to consider the patient's age in the context of their overall health when determining their relative risk of injury following trauma than to consider age alone. Observational studies suggest that frail older trauma patients fare worse than their healthier counterparts and that pre-existing comorbidities may be more important than chronological age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3512230\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND MECHANISMS OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Falls and motor vehicle crashes are the most common mechanisms of injury among the elderly. However, most importantly, elder trauma patients experience higher mortality than their younger counterparts regardless of the mechanism involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,14</a>]. Up to one-third of all elder patients presenting with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 15 can be expected to die while in the hospital.</p><p>Falls are the most common cause of injury in patients over the age of 65, accounting for nearly three-quarters of all trauma in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. According to a systematic review of 18 studies, the probability of falling at least once in any given year for individuals 65 years and older is approximately 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Falls in the elderly most often occur from a standing position on a level surface, with orthopedic injury (eg, hip or long bone fracture) the most common significant complication. Despite the seemingly benign mechanism in many cases, falls can lead to dire medical and economic consequences for elder patients, including the need for tracheal intubation or blood transfusion, cervical spine or thoracic injury, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5,13,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,17,18</a>].

About one-quarter of all elderly victims of motor vehicle crashes sustain a chest injury (most often rib fractures), which can exacerbate preexisting cardiopulmonary disease and increases the risk of significant complications, including pneumonia and respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The elderly are second only to children as victims of automobile-pedestrian accidents, but account for the largest percentage of the auto-pedestrian fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,22-25</a>]. The highest mortality rate in geriatric trauma is among pedestrians struck by a vehicle.</p><p>With all types of blunt trauma, geriatric patients are more likely to sustain injuries of all types, particularly fractures, than their younger counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26-28</a>]. Based largely upon retrospective data, it appears that fractures of the spine (especially of the cervical spine), ribs, hip, and extremities are among the injuries more likely to occur in older patients. (See <a href=\"#H3512279\" class=\"local\">'Common and high risk injuries'</a> below.)</p><p>Burns can have a devastating effect on geriatric patients, in whom mortality is significantly higher for any size burn than in younger adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The authors of a retrospective study of a predictive model for elderly burn patients reported that the median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) for patients aged 60 to 70 was 43.1 percent total body surface area (TBSA) burned, for those aged 70 to 80 the LD<sub>50</sub> was 25.9 percent TBSA, and for those 80 and older the LD<sub>50</sub> was only 13.1 percent TBSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Physicians should always consider the possibility of elder abuse and suicide attempt when caring for elderly trauma victims.

The physiology of aging is discussed in detail separately, but changes of particular relevance to trauma and their implications are briefly described below and summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F88606\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88606 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-aging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal aging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-function-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune function in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Older adults have reduced vital capacity, functional residual capacity, and forced expiratory volume (FEV1), which diminishes respiratory reserve and limits the ability to tolerate even minor trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/15,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,33</a>]. Responses to hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis are often blunted in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, they are less able to compensate for metabolic disturbances and more likely to present with a normal respiratory rate despite becoming progressively hypoxic and hypercarbic, making clinical assessment challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The myocardium of older adults becomes stiff, compromising cardiac output, and less sensitive to catecholamines, which often results in a less profound tachycardic response to hemorrhage, pain, or anxiety following trauma. The absence of an absolute tachycardia due to this blunted response may create a false sense of security on the part of clinicians. Systemic vascular resistance is increased, often contributing to baseline hypertension, which can lead to the misinterpretation of blood pressure readings following trauma when expected declines may not manifest despite the onset of shock. Put another way, the values that should be considered abnormal for vital signs are different in older patients. As an example, according to a large retrospective review of geriatric blunt trauma patients, heart rates above 90 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure less than 110 mmHg correlate with increased mortality in this population. Among younger trauma patients, comparable increases in mortality are not seen until the heart rate reaches 130 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure drops below 95 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>In older patients, the dura adheres tightly to the skull and bridging veins become stretched, thereby increasing the risk of subdural hemorrhage from head injury, while reducing the risk of epidural hemorrhage. In addition, there is approximately a 30 percent reduction in brain size between the ages of 30 and 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This brain atrophy increases the space in which blood can accumulate and may delay the development of symptoms and signs associated with subdural hemorrhage. In some older adults, dementia complicates medical assessment following trauma. Cerebrovascular autoregulation declines with age, making the brain potentially more susceptible to injury during periods of systemic hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Lower bone density and compliance results in increased risk for all types of fractures, particularly hip and rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18711877\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATION AND DISEASE-RELATED RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elder individuals are more likely to have chronic disease and to take multiple medications to manage these ailments. Medications that pose special risks to the elder trauma patient include anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and glucocorticoids. Pre-injury beta blockade has been shown to increase the odds of death, likely due to the masking of normal physiologic responses to shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Chronic glucocorticoid use, as might be seen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also increases mortality in trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Drug metabolism is altered in older adults. The increase in total body fat and reduction in lean body mass that occurs with aging increases the volume of distribution of many medications, which can prolong their duration of effect. Declines in hepatic and renal function alter the metabolism and elimination of many medications. These changes not only complicate the management of older trauma patients but also increase their risk for sustaining trauma, as found in a meta-analysis published in 2009 that reported a strong association between the use of benzodiazepines, sedative-hypnotics, and antidepressants and falls in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The addition of any medication is associated with a significant increase in the risk of falls among elderly patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=falls-in-older-persons-risk-factors-and-patient-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Falls in older persons: Risk factors and patient evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although hypertension and heart disease are the most common preexisting conditions among elderly trauma patients, hepatic disease, renal insufficiency, and cancer confer the greatest mortality risk of all comorbid medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In addition, decompensated (congestive) heart failure increases mortality substantially, particularly in patients taking anticoagulants, beta blockers, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3512244\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSMENT AND INITIAL INTERVENTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11540879\"><span class=\"h2\">Problem of under-triage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional physiologic parameters used to identify high risk trauma patients, such as systolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg or heart rate above 120 beats per minute, do not account for the declining physiologic capacities of elder patients. Although there is limited prospective data to guide triage decisions about geriatric trauma patients, given the increased risk for severe injury and death in this population, we suggest that trauma patients over the age of 70 be evaluated at a trauma center with trauma team activation whenever possible, regardless of the mechanism (ie, falls from standing warrant such evaluation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,46</a>]. In addition we concur with guidelines published by the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) calling for direct transport to a trauma center for any patient 65 or older with a systolic blood pressure &lt;110 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. We also believe it is reasonable to use a pulse of 90 or above as the threshold defining tachycardia, which may be a sign of hemorrhage or significant injury warranting careful investigation. We make these suggestions in the hope of helping clinicians to avoid under-triage, which is a significant problem in the management of geriatric trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Multiple observational studies demonstrate the problem of under-triage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/46,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,49-51</a>]. As an example, one retrospective study of 26,565 trauma patients reported an under-triage rate of 49 percent in patients older than 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].<sup> </sup>Under-triage may be due in part to lack of recognition that elderly patients are at greater risk of injury and in part to traditional triage tools (eg, vital signs, mechanism of injury, or the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma triage criteria) that may be relatively insensitive for signs of injury in older patients. The impact of insensitive triage criteria is supported by several retrospective studies, including a review of 51,227 adult trauma cases in which many of the classic physiologic criteria used for trauma team activation, such as blood pressure and heart rate, failed to predict hospital mortality in geriatric trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/46,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,50</a>]. In this study, trauma team activation occurred significantly less often for elderly patients (14 versus 29 percent) despite a similar percentage of severe injuries (defined as Injury Severity Score &gt;15). It is likely that under-triage has multiple causes. Some researchers suggest that inadequate training of clinicians and age bias contribute to the problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>Under-triage is particularly concerning given studies that show improved outcomes when elderly patients with significant injuries are taken to level one or level two trauma centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In addition, advancing age is associated with an increasing risk of death even among minimally injured patients, according to another large retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Another problem in geriatric trauma is the implementation of appropriate triage criteria. In an observational study comparing the periods before and after geriatric trauma criteria were introduced to a state EMS system, researchers found that the proportion of older adults meeting the criteria for trauma center transport increased substantially after the introduction but no actual increase in trauma center transports occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H714308\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to obtain a precise history whenever possible, although this can be difficult to accomplish with elderly trauma patients. A general discussion of the history in adult trauma is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929832\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to standard inquiries about events and mechanism, important questions to ask older patients (or their family members, emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, or others who may have insight) include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happened immediately before the trauma (eg, altered consciousness, difficulty breathing, change in vision)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What medications is the patient taking (eg, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, beta blocker, calcium channel blocker)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What underlying illnesses does the patient have (eg, cardiovascular or renal disease, diabetes)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What was the patient's baseline level of motor and cognitive function prior to the traumatic event?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have a written advanced directive or a health care proxy that may be useful for determining the goals of care?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3512258\"><span class=\"h2\">Prehospital management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency medical services (EMS) providers must be taught that minor trauma, such as falls from standing and minor motor vehicle accidents, can cause significant injuries and even death in geriatric patients. We suggest that trauma patients over the age of 70 be evaluated at a trauma center whenever possible, regardless of the mechanism of injury. (See <a href=\"#H11540879\" class=\"local\">'Problem of under-triage'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to the relatively common injuries sustained in trauma, elderly patients are more likely to sustain otherwise rare injuries, such as C1 or C2 cervical spine fractures, which may result from a simple fall onto a hard surface. At the same time, elderly patients do not tolerate standard cervical spine immobilization procedures as well as their younger counterparts. While there are no hard and fast rules, provider judgment may be needed to determine when strict immobilization is necessary and when a more permissive approach is acceptable. This might entail allowing for slight (&lt;30 percent) elevation of the head of the bed or foregoing a rigid backboard or cervical collar.</p><p>Based upon evidence of increased morbidity and mortality among elder trauma patients, a number of specialists advocate transport to a trauma center and activation of the trauma team based solely upon patient age regardless of the mechanism of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/46,48,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48,56</a>]. As an example, one retrospective observational study of 883 trauma patients aged 70 or older reported a mortality rate of 16 percent among the 660 &quot;stable&quot; patients who did not meet any standard trauma team activation criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Another retrospective cohort study of 87 geriatric patients with significant pelvic fractures reported a lower complication rate among those transported directly to a level one trauma center compared to those brought to a non-trauma center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Nevertheless, evidence about the appropriate transport and evaluation of older trauma patients is limited and other groups use different criteria. As an example, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) recommends transport to a designated trauma center for trauma patients over the age of 55 regardless of mechanism or apparent severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3512265\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary survey</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H568664292\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard primary survey is appropriate for the management of elder trauma patients and is reviewed in detail separately. Issues of special importance in elder trauma patients are discussed here. Although elder trauma patients are at increased risk of death and disability, many respond well to resuscitative measures and aggressive management is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Of note, blunted responses to hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis can delay clinical signs of distress in elder trauma patients. Therefore, providers should assume that serious injuries are likely to be present even when concerning clinical findings are not apparent initially. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929690\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Primary evaluation and management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-aging#H23810938\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal aging&quot;, section on 'Respiratory system'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H568664299\"><span class=\"h3\">Airway and breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When performing the primary survey in an elder trauma patient, clinicians should look for airway anomalies that are likely to complicate management, such as limited mouth-opening (temporomandibular arthritis) and dentures. Laryngoscopy and intubation are more difficult in patients with limited mouth opening. Bag mask ventilation is often more difficult once dentures are removed; intact dentures should be kept in place should assisted ventilation become necessary. Geriatric patients have limited respiratory reserve, making early administration of supplemental high flow oxygen of great importance. According to one retrospective study of geriatric trauma patients, a respiratory rate below 10 breaths per minute is associated with a greater risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diminished respiratory reserve often prevents geriatric patients from compensating adequately for chest injuries. Early aggressive airway management, including tracheal intubation, may be necessary. Should rapid sequence intubation be required, the doses for drugs that may cause hemodynamic compromise, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and even <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a>, should be reduced between 30 and 50 percent to minimize the risk of cardiovascular depression.

In one prospective observational study of 22 patients with blunt thoracic trauma, use of noninvasive bilevel positive pressure ventilation substantially improved gas exchange and vital signs enabling 18 patients to avoid tracheal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Baseline hypertension is common among older patients and in the setting of trauma may contribute to a false sense of comfort on the part of clinicians when a blood pressure in the &quot;normal&quot; range actually represents relative hypotension. Thus, trends of vital signs are typically more useful than any individual measurement. Repeat measurements should be obtained frequently and all readings interpreted in light of the patient's likely baseline and previous readings.</p><p>The effect of medications the patient takes regularly can further obscure the meaning of vital sign measurements. Beta blockers and other antihypertensive medications commonly taken by geriatric patients can blunt the normal tachycardic response to hemorrhagic shock. This effect is compounded by the decreased sensitivity of older myocardium to circulating catecholamines. (See <a href=\"#H3512237\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Multiple studies demonstrate the unreliability of vital signs in older trauma patients. According to one retrospective study, mortality increases among elderly trauma patients when their heart rate rises above 90 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure falls below 110 mmHg, while the same increase in mortality is not evident in younger patients until heart rates reach 130 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure falls below 95 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Another study found evidence of tissue hypoperfusion despite &quot;normal&quot; blood pressures in elder trauma patients without isolated head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Given that vital signs may be an unreliable guide to hemodynamic status, it is important to look for signs of shock in patients who would otherwise be considered &quot;normotensive.&quot; Signs such as subtle alterations in mental status (eg, mild confusion, somnolence, or agitation), mild tachypnea, delayed capillary refill, and low urine output may reflect hypoperfusion and early shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;, section on 'Recognition of shock'</a>.)</p><p>Using ultrasound as part of the primary survey to look for evidence of internal hemorrhage in older patients, who may not manifest signs of shock, is a sound approach. Ultrasound is both sensitive and specific for detecting significant hemoperitoneum in blunt trauma, and is useful for detecting pneumothorax. In addition, geriatric trauma patients are at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction and ultrasound can be useful for identifying such problems. Serial examinations improve the sensitivity and accuracy of ultrasound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other tools that can help to identify hypoperfusion and shock in older adults include serial diagnostic testing using a blood lactate concentration or a venous or arterial blood gas. (See <a href=\"#H983530\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Aggressive treatment with IV boluses of isotonic crystalloid is appropriate for the initial treatment of elder trauma patients with hypotension or signs of hypoperfusion. One reasonable approach is to rapidly infuse a bolus of 500 mL and assess the patient's response (eg, measure blood pressure, auscultate for lung crackles), and then repeat the bolus, if needed. However, preexisting conditions such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or renal dysfunction can cause elderly patients to decompensate from excessive fluid administration or blood loss. Therefore, it is reasonable to begin transfusing packed red blood cells if hypotension or signs of hypoperfusion persist after just 1 or 2 L of crystalloid are infused. However, as with all trauma patients, excessive crystalloid administration may be harmful. The potential benefit of permissive hypotension, and how best to define hypotension, has not been clearly established in the elder trauma patient. Transfusion for trauma patients with severe bleeding is discussed separately.

Monitoring should include serial examinations, including vital signs, mental status, and reassessment of any areas of concern. There is inadequate evidence to support firm guidelines, and the frequency and intensity of reevaluation will vary depending upon the baseline health of the patient, the clinical scenario, and available resources. As a general guideline, we suggest that a relatively healthy 70 year old without an apparent severe internal injury but who was involved in significant trauma (eg, motor vehicle collision) receive a focused reassessment approximately every 5 minutes while the primary and secondary surveys are performed, every 15 minutes during the first hour after the surveys are completed, and hourly thereafter until the patient is discharged or admitted, and assuming no problem arises while in the emergency department.</p><p>In addition to a cardiac monitor and pulse oximeter, we suggest using an end-tidal CO2 monitor for any older patient with the potential for respiratory problems. This may include patients complaining of mild shortness of breath or those who sustained a seemingly minor fall with a possible chest wall injury.

This is because the incidence of cervical spine injury is greater in geriatric patients and evaluation is more difficult (history and examination may be less sensitive for injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/85-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-87</a>].

In particular, high cervical fractures (eg, odontoid) are significantly more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

Conditions such as cervical stenosis and degenerative rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, which are also more common in elder patients, make the spine more vulnerable to fracture and the interpretation of plain radiographs more difficult.

Therefore, liberal use of advanced imaging studies (eg, computed tomography) is warranted for those at risk for such injury.</p><p>Central cord syndrome is a complication of cervical spine injury that occurs more often in older trauma patients. It is most frequently the result of a hyperextension injury in individuals with long-standing cervical spondylosis, and is characterized by disproportionately greater motor impairment in upper compared with lower extremities, bladder dysfunction, and a variable degree of sensory loss below the level of injury.

A systematic review of studies of risk factors for death following blunt chest wall trauma confirmed that elders are at significant risk of complications (eg, pneumonia, pulmonary contusion) and mortality with even three or fewer non-displaced rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].<sup> </sup>In this review, the major risk factors for mortality following blunt chest wall trauma were age 65 years or older, three or more rib fractures, and pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease.

Thus, early evaluation to detect intraperitoneal hemorrhage (most often using ultrasound) is important. In stable patients, it is best to obtain a CT scan if intra-abdominal injury is suspected. The risk of contrast-induced nephropathy is higher in elders, particularly in the presence of hypovolemia, chronic renal disease, or diabetes, and measures should be taken to avoid this complication.

The approach will vary by institution, but early surgical consultation and investigation (eg, angiography, CT-angiography) is warranted in any geriatric patient with a pelvic fracture, other than a minor fracture of a pubic ramus, and evidence of hemorrhage (eg, elevated heart rate, ongoing transfusion requirements, pelvic hematoma on standard CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In addition to hip and pelvis fractures, other common injury sites include the distal radius and ulna, proximal humerus, and clavicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. As many of these extremity injuries too are associated with increased mortality, clinicians should look carefully for such fractures when evaluating geriatric trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64976550\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin wounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older adult trauma victims are more likely to sustain skin tears and other superficial wounds.

Admission or transfer to a trauma center is appropriate for patients over the age of 65 with an injury from blunt chest trauma (even a single rib or clavicle fracture), blunt abdominal trauma associated with any symptoms or findings, head trauma with <strong>any</strong> alteration in mental status or other sign of injury (eg, hemotympanum, retroauricular ecchymosis), extremity trauma that limits the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living, or concerning symptoms such as pain that is not easily controlled or shortness of breath. Transfer to a trauma center should not be delayed in order to complete imaging studies. Special care should be taken with older patients who have significant underlying comorbidities such as cardiopulmonary disease, as such conditions dramatically increase the risk for adverse outcomes following trauma. (See <a href=\"#H18711877\" class=\"local\">'Medication and disease-related risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to the general guidelines above, we suggest admission to an intensive care setting in a trauma center whenever possible for elderly patients with significant injury to one or more organ systems, two or more rib fractures, a serum lactate concentration &ge;2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> or concerning vital sign trends (eg, increasing heart or respiratory rate), even if the absolute measurements are not grossly abnormal.</p><p>Potential causes of trauma in the elderly include cardiac syncope, myocardial infarction, infection, and stroke. Therefore, determining the cause of trauma is another potential reason for admitting the elderly patient to the hospital.

The Geriatric Trauma Outcome Score (GTOS) is a useful tool for assessing in-hospital mortality risk in the injured elder patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management/abstract/98-100\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-100</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3512329\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no clear definition of geriatric trauma; for the purposes of this review, we consider patients 65 and older to be geriatric. Geriatric patients have greater morbidity and mortality for virtually all traumatic injuries and mechanisms. Even apparently benign mechanisms (eg, fall from standing) can cause significant injury. However, with proper care and appreciation for the differences in geriatric trauma, a return to baseline functional status is a reasonable expectation for many patients, including those with major injuries. (See <a href=\"#H18711554\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3512230\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and mechanisms of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of the anatomic and physiologic changes that accompany aging place the geriatric trauma patient at greater risk of injury and death, and impair their capacity to respond to the stress of injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F88606\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88606 \">table 1</a>). In addition, patients frequently have pre-existing conditions that further diminish physiologic reserve and they may take medications that mask signs of injury. Clinicians must remain vigilant, even in the setting of &quot;normal&quot; vital signs and &quot;minor&quot; mechanisms. (See <a href=\"#H3512237\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy and pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18711877\" class=\"local\">'Medication and disease-related risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Geriatric trauma patients are chronically under-triaged, increasing their risk for morbidity and death. We suggest that trauma patients over the age of 70 be evaluated at a trauma center with trauma team activation whenever possible, regardless of the mechanism. In addition, we suggest that any patient 65 or older with a systolic blood pressure &lt;110 mmHg be transported directly to a trauma center for evaluation, and that a heart rate of 90 be used as the threshold for tachycardia in patients in this age group. (See <a href=\"#H11540879\" class=\"local\">'Problem of under-triage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the standard trauma history, the following questions are important to address with geriatric trauma:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What happened immediately before the trauma (eg, altered consciousness, difficulty breathing, change in vision)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What medications is the patient taking (eg, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, beta blocker, calcium channel blocker)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What underlying illnesses does the patient have (eg, hypertension, cardiovascular or renal disease, diabetes)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>What was the patient's baseline level of motor and cognitive function prior to the traumatic event?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Does the patient have a written advanced directive or a health care proxy that may be useful for determining the goals of care?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunted responses to hypoxia, hypercarbia, and acidosis can delay clinical signs of distress in elder trauma patients. Therefore, providers should assume that serious injuries are likely to be present even when concerning clinical findings are not apparent initially. Diminished respiratory reserve often prevents geriatric patients from compensating adequately for chest injuries. Early aggressive airway management may be necessary, and may include tracheal intubation or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H568664292\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H568664299\" class=\"local\">'Airway and breathing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Normal&quot; vital signs in geriatric trauma patients may be substantially different from their younger counterparts; recognizing early shock is more difficult. Baseline hypertension is common among older patients and this may lead clinicians to misinterpret a blood pressure in the &quot;normal&quot; range that actually represents relative hypotension. The effect of medications (eg, beta blocker) can further obscure the meaning of vital sign measurements. Trends of vital signs are often more useful than any individual measurement. (See <a href=\"#H568664306\" class=\"local\">'Circulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive resuscitation is appropriate for the initial treatment of elder trauma patients with hypotension or signs of hypoperfusion. One reasonable approach is to rapidly infuse a bolus of 500 mL, assess the patient's response, and repeat the bolus if needed. However, preexisting conditions such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, or renal dysfunction can cause elderly patients to decompensate from excessive fluid administration or blood loss. Therefore, it is reasonable to begin transfusing packed red blood cells if hypotension or signs of hypoperfusion persist after just 1 or 2 L of crystalloid are infused. (See <a href=\"#H568664306\" class=\"local\">'Circulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Particularly in older trauma patients, who may not manifest obvious signs of injury, close monitoring is essential. Monitoring should include serial examinations, including vital signs, mental status, and reassessment of any areas of concern. In addition to a cardiac monitor and pulse oximeter, we suggest using an end-tidal CO2 monitor for any older patient with the potential for respiratory problems. (See <a href=\"#H568664313\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We obtain basic laboratory studies in elder trauma patients with known or at significant risk for major injuries. These studies are listed in the text. Lactate concentrations and base deficit measurements can be helpful in the management of geriatric patients with multi-system trauma, who are at increased risk of occult injury. (See <a href=\"#H983530\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough systematic secondary survey is necessary for all elder trauma patients. Important and common injuries to keep in mind include: head (eg, intracranial) injury, cervical spine injury, major burns, clavicle and rib fractures, hip fracture, and pelvic fracture. (See <a href=\"#H3512272\" class=\"local\">'Secondary survey'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3512279\" class=\"local\">'Common and high risk injuries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in patients with head trauma. Thus, in nearly all cases of head trauma in geriatric patients, it is prudent to obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head. The management of patients taking anticoagulants is described in the text. High cervical fractures (eg, odontoid) are more common in elder patients. (See <a href=\"#H3512287\" class=\"local\">'Head injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished pain sensation and increased laxity of abdominal wall musculature make the abdominal examination less reliable in geriatric patients. Early evaluation to detect intraperitoneal hemorrhage (eg, using ultrasound) is important. In stable patients, it is best to obtain a CT scan if intra-abdominal injury is suspected. The risk of contrast-induced nephropathy is higher in elder patients and preventative measures should be taken.
