Objective information regarding the occurrence of ischemia can be obtained from ECG stress testing, myocardial perfusion studies, Holter monitoring, or other established diagnostic techniques known to objectively identify myocardial ischemia.

Myocardial oxygen demand is dependent upon several factors, including heart rate, myocardial contractibility, afterload (for practical reasons systolic blood pressure is often taken as a surrogate), and ventricular wall tension (preload). However, for clinical purposes, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and the calculated double product (HR x systolic BP) are considered the most important determinants of myocardial oxygen demand. Coronary artery spasm is a known cause of primary reduction in blood supply that can lead to myocardial ischemia.

However, as also seen in angina-associated ischemia, not all episodes of silent myocardial ischemia are preceded by an increased heart rate. Additionally, mental stress and intrinsic physiologic changes due to the circadian rhythm are associated with significant hemodynamic changes (eg, increase in heart rate and blood pressure) that raise myocardial oxygen demand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silent-myocardial-ischemia-epidemiology-diagnosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many episodes of silent myocardial ischemia occur during minimal or no physical activity, suggesting that increased myocardial oxygen demand (at least that associated with tachycardia) may not play a significant role in those particular instances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silent-myocardial-ischemia-epidemiology-diagnosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

Experts agree that silent myocardial ischemia requires treatment to minimize potentially harmful effects of ischemic episodes on the myocardium. The mechanisms leading to silent ischemia are similar to those causing angina pectoris. In a large percentage of patients, particularly in those with obstructive coronary artery disease, increased myocardial oxygen demand appears to be the primary reason for the development of ischemia. However, some patients with microvascular angina may also experience myocardial ischemia due to increased oxygen demand in the presence of coronary microvascular dysfunction and despite having angiographically normal coronary arteries. In these cases, beta blockers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heart rate-reducing calcium channel blockers (eg, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>) are the logical therapeutic agents since these drugs decrease myocardial oxygen demand. </p><p>ST segment depression on ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring can be used to evaluate the effect of anti-ischemic therapies.

Approximately 30 percent of patients enrolled in the study were asymptomatic, although most patients had angina symptoms.

Although the results suggested that surgical revascularization was more effective than percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or medical therapy in suppressing myocardial ischemia and improving clinical outcome, drug therapies were not optimized and may have minimized the efficacy of medical therapy in improving the clinical outcome.</p><p>The lack of optimal medical therapy is not a trivial issue. Among patients with stable angina at increased risk, initial trials suggested better outcomes with PCI. Of greater relevance is the COURAGE trial published in 2007, which compared optimal medical therapy alone (both antianginal drugs and aggressive secondary prevention) with optimal medical therapy plus PCI with bare metal stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silent-myocardial-ischemia-epidemiology-diagnosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. There was no difference between the groups in the primary end point of death from any cause and non-fatal MI at 4.6 years.

However, the optimal diagnostic and therapeutic approach to such individuals is not known. In a study of 769 asymptomatic individuals previously treated with either coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention who had myocardial ischemia identified by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), 15 percent underwent revascularization at a median of 13 days after MPS, and the rest continued with medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/silent-myocardial-ischemia-epidemiology-diagnosis-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Silent myocardial ischemia is seen in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with CHD and appears to represent the majority of episodes of ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the precise mechanism responsible for silent myocardial ischemia has not been established, a number of possible reasons for a lack of anginal symptoms during some episodes of ischemia have been proposed and include lesser severity and shorter duration of episodes, higher threshold for pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inability to reach pain threshold, impaired perception of painful stimuli, defective anginal warning system, and higher beta-endorphin levels. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Silent myocardial ischemia can be detected during either stress testing or ambulatory monitoring. Silent myocardial ischemia is diagnosed during stress testing by one of the following means (see <a href=\"#H538446879\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H538445384\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exercise treadmill testing &ndash; Horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression of at least 1 mm without associated symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging &ndash; Reduced myocardial perfusion on stress imaging, with improved or normalized perfusion on rest imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stress echocardiography &ndash; The induction of a regional wall motion abnormality during stress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring &ndash; Flat or downsloping ST depression of at least 1 mm, with gradual onset and offset, that lasts for at least one minute.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased risk of coronary events and cardiac mortality in association with silent myocardial ischemia has been extensively documented in patients with CHD, including patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, and stable angina, as well as among patients without a history of obstructive CHD. (See <a href=\"#H1538386052\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with silent myocardial ischemia in the setting of known CHD should all be treated with appropriate secondary prevention measures.

In addition, coronary revascularization may be an option for specific patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with convincing evidence of silent myocardial ischemia should be treated with a beta blocker as the initial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3683373475\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Monotherapy with calcium channel blockers should primarily be used in patients with a specific pathogenic mechanism that has been identified which is expected to respond better to calcium channel blockers (eg, vasospastic angina), or if a patient is intolerant of beta blockers. (See <a href=\"#H2959755588\" class=\"local\">'Calcium channel blockers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Combination drug therapy is necessary when monotherapy with beta blockers (or, rarely, calcium channel blockers) does not effectively suppress silent ischemia.

However, the available data suggest that revascularization may improve patient outcomes, particularly following acute MI in patients treated with thrombolysis or who are incompletely revascularized.
