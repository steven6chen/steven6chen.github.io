(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1185933677\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS AND EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for injury with routine cystoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routine use of intraoperative cystoscopy (complete term cystourethroscopy) to screen for urinary tract injury in women undergoing major gynecologic surgery is a topic of debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Visualization of the urinary tract is routinely performed during gynecologic surgery. In addition, cystoscopy can be performed routinely (ie, for all women) or selectively (ie, based on patient risk factors or intraoperative concerns).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3863298597\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest intraoperative use of cystoscopy in addition to visual inspection of the urinary tract, rather than visual inspection alone, for women undergoing surgical treatment of urinary incontinence or anterior or apical pelvic organ prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. We also perform intraoperative cystoscopy for women undergoing hysterectomy (any route) or those undergoing oophorectomy who have risk factors for ureteral injury (eg, endometriosis, history of pelvic irradiation laparoscopic hysterectomy). Surgeons are encouraged to have a low threshold for performing cystoscopy at the time of hysterectomy, but the decision to do so is surgeon-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-patient-care-issues-in-female-pelvic-reconstructive-surgery#H181480700\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative patient care issues in female pelvic reconstructive surgery&quot;, section on 'Intraoperative cystourethroscopy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2058730377\"><span class=\"h3\">Potential benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine intraoperative cystoscopy, compared with selective cystoscopy, has been proposed to reduce the incidence of unrecognized urinary tract injury during surgery and thereby reduce patient morbidity and cost associated with delayed diagnosis and repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Routine intraoperative cystoscopy increases the detection rate of urinary tract injury up to fivefold compared with not using cystoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], in part because most ureteral injuries are not typically detected by visual inspection alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. In a systematic review of 79 retrospective and prospective studies, the proportion of ureteric and bladder injuries detected increased to nearly 95 percent with routine cystoscopy compared with detection rates of 18 and 79 percent without routine cystoscopy, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Routine cystoscopy as a screening tool after all major gynecologic procedures, especially hysterectomy, remains difficult to evaluate for clinical significance and cost-effectiveness because of the low rate of injuries. It has been estimated that a trial would require approximately 25,500 women in each arm for 80 percent power to detect a difference between one and two injuries per 1000 surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although the value of routine cystoscopy per case may be low, the value of routine cystoscopy per surgeon may be high. Over time, as a surgeon accumulates more experience in easy and difficult cases, the immediate feedback provided by cystoscopy about urinary tract integrity (secondary prevention) can help the surgeon develop a better awareness of risk that can alter the planning of future cases (primary prevention). For example, the surgeon could change preoperative imaging, route of hysterectomy, type of incision, or level of assistance for future cases and thereby decrease their future patients' risk of injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H866640075\"><span class=\"h3\">Potential concerns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential concerns associated with routine cystoscopy include detection of clinically insignificant injuries, false positive findings, complications, increased cost for training and instruments, and lack of demonstrable benefit in the postoperative period. Minor urinary tract injuries, such as an absorbable suture in the bladder, can resolve without harm. The incidence of asymptomatic undetected urinary tract injuries is not known. However, the concern for overdetection of minor injuries does not appear warranted based on prospective studies demonstrating the majority of injuries diagnosed with routine cystoscopy are clinically significant ureteral transection or kinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. Additionally, the risk of false positive findings appears to be low. In a prospective study of nearly 840 women, cystoscopic examination revealed abnormal ureteral efflux (sluggish or absent flow), but no detectable injury, in 2 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In all women with abnormal flow, the urine flow rate normalized after the patient received a bolus of intravenous fluid, with or without the addition of a diuretic. Although many gynecologists are not trained to perform cystoscopy, it is easily learned. The cystoscopy complication rate is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions#H461325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic cystourethroscopy for gynecologic conditions&quot;, section on 'Procedure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions#H462087\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic cystourethroscopy for gynecologic conditions&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>The increased cost of routine cystoscopy is frequently cited as a reason to use the technique only selectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Increased cost is incurred by training gynecologists to perform cystoscopy, using additional equipment and operating room time, and evaluating or treating injuries that would have healed spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One study that analyzed the cost-effectiveness of routine cystoscopy during total abdominal hysterectomy reported that when the ureteral injury rate reached 1.5 percent, the additional cost of routine intraoperative cystoscopy was equal to the cost from missed injuries if cystoscopy were not performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Limitations of this study included the inaccurate assumptions that intraoperative cystoscopy has 100 percent sensitivity and specificity, that all injuries detected would have required surgical repair, and that medical malpractice costs were not included in the estimated costs. Cost effectiveness is further complicated by the fact that both costs and injury rates for procedures vary across institutions and regions and therefore the breakpoint for the cost versus benefit of routine cystoscopy will differ by setting.</p><p>Lastly, although routine cystoscopy is associated with improved intraoperative detection of ureteral and bladder injuries, a subsequent decrease in postoperatively detected injuries has not been demonstrated when intraoperative cystoscopy is routinely used. In a systematic review of 79 retrospective and prospective studies, there was no difference in the postoperative detection rates for ureteral and bladder injuries between the groups with and without routine cystoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Possible explanations include that postoperatively detected injuries were underreported, injuries detected with routine cystoscopy would have resolved spontaneously, or a combination of both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1824852880\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraoperative evaluation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H728892594\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of intravesicle contrast or fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of agents that color the urine can be used to assess the integrity of the lower urinary tract. Although cystoscopy can be performed without the use of a marker dye to stain the urine, the ureteral jets can be difficult to visualize, particularly in patients with dilute urine. In contrast, leakage of dye into the operative field confirms the presence of a bladder or ureteral defect and helps to pinpoint its location as well as enables identification of the ureteral jets. The absence of the appearance of dye does not exclude injury since dye may be sequestered (eg, in the retroperitoneum) or an injury other than a laceration may have occurred (eg, thermal injury).</p><p>Dye can be administered through several routes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravesical contrast or fluid &ndash; Either intravesical dye or distending media can aid visualization of the ureteral jets or bladder injury. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> (two to three drops diluted in saline) has traditionally been used for intravesical distention, drug availability is now limited. As an alternate, sterile infant formula can be used to distend the bladder, and is commonly available in obstetric operating rooms (no dilution required) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Intravesical dye is primarily for suspected bladder injury; ureteral injuries distal from the bladder may not be revealed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternately, some clinicians prefer intravesical instillation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> solution as an aid to visualize ureteral jets. In an unblinded trial of 131 women undergoing gynecologic surgery, surgeons rated mannitol bladder distension as providing the best visualization, ease of use, and overall satisfaction when compared with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenazopyridine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenazopyridine</a>, intravenous sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a>, and normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. No adverse events were reported in any of the arms, including for postoperative urinary tract infection. In contrast, a prior study reported that use of 50% dextrose solution for bladder instillation was associated with increased rates of postoperative urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> (0.25 mL or 25 mg of 10 percent solution is administered intravenously and colors the urine fluorescent yellow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. We dilute 1 mL of 10 percent sodium fluorescein in 9 mL of normal saline and administer 1 mL (10 mg) intravenously.

If the bladder is full of the bright yellow urine, it may need to be rinsed to better visualize the contrast when evaluating ureteric integrity. Administration of a fluid bolus or placing the patient in reverse Trendelenburg position speeds the flow of dye; a diuretic (eg, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> 20 mg) may be used in patients who have no renal compromise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Indigo carmine</a> (2.5 mL of a 0.8 percent solution) has traditionally been used to color the urine blue.

Indigo carmine should not be given to patients with a history of anaphylaxis to sulfa medications, since indigo carmine may cross-react with sulfa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral &ndash; For surgeries with planned cystoscopy, the patient can take a 100 mg of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenazopyridine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenazopyridine</a> one hour before surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Phenazopyridine colors the urine reddish-orange. As the drug is cleared by the kidneys, it is not given to patients with renal insufficiency. While oral vitamin B has been described to color urine, its use with cystoscopy is limited because the change in urine color is inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>Alternate agents to detect ureteral efflux have included cystoscopic dextrose in sterile water (D10 or D50) and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>. We do not use cystoscopic D10 because it has been associated with nearly double the incidence of postoperative urinary tract infections compared with cystoscopic normal saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Methylene blue is not used intravenously to color urine because a cumulative dose &gt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> can result in methemoglobinemia in susceptible individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-methemoglobinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of methemoglobinemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following intravenous or oral administration of dye, colored urine will be visible in the operative field if a defect is present, in addition to appearing in the bladder catheter collection system. Output of colored urine signifies only that at least one ureter is functioning, but does not indicate which ureter may be open. Failure to visualize colored urine in the output of the bladder catheter after administering a dye suggests occlusion of both ureters. Marked delay between drainage from one ureter or obvious differences in the amount of dye seen coming from each ureter suggests partial obstruction.</p><p>Administration of a fluid bolus or placing the patient in reverse Trendelenburg position may speed the flow of dye, or a diuretic (eg, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> 20 mg) may be used in patients without renal compromise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Visual inspection of the urinary tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative evaluation is warranted any time there is a finding suggestive of urinary tract injury or clinical concern. When using an abdominal or laparoscopic surgical approach, the first step in the evaluation of suspected injury is visual inspection to assess the integrity of the bladder and ureters and the nature and severity of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If an injury is identified, complete evaluation of the urinary tract is still performed as the contralateral ureter or bladder may also have been injured. Bladder injury is more likely than ureteral injury to be diagnosed using visual inspection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/1,6,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,25,26</a>]. In a prospective study over 800 women who underwent hysterectomy, visual inspection detected 38 percent bladder injuries versus 7 percent of ureteral injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Findings that are diagnostic for urinary tract injury include seeing urine in the operative field, a defect in the ureter or bladder such as transection or laceration, or the bladder catheter or mucosa in the operative field. Findings suggestive of urinary tract injury include blood in the bladder catheter (particularly if it is ongoing); the ureter in close proximity to a clamp, suture, or staple; and gas in the urine or bladder catheter during laparoscopic surgery. Ongoing hematuria is more suggestive of injury than blood that clears rapidly from the urine. Transient bleeding can result from minor trauma during urinary tract manipulation (eg, insertion of the bladder catheter, pressure from retractor) and typically clears. If hematuria persists, further evaluation for a urinary tract injury is performed. </p><p>Observing the ureter for peristalsis is used to identify the ureter, but it is not a valid test for ureteral integrity. In a retrospective study in which women undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy were evaluated with intraoperative cystoscopy, peristalsis was present in five of six women with ureteral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Full evaluation of a ureter may require further dissection of the ureter. Whether to perform this ureteral dissection initially or defer dissection and evaluate the urinary tract integrity at a later time during surgery (eg, with cystoscopy) is based upon the surgeon's preference and skills. The technique for dissection of the ureters and bladders is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-epidemiology-and-prevention#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract injury in gynecologic surgery: Epidemiology and prevention&quot;, section on 'Surgical technique'</a>.)</p><p>During vaginal surgery, all pedicles and the anterior vaginal wall should be inspected for possible areas of impingement upon urinary tract structures. It is not possible to inspect the bladder or ureters directly when using a vaginal approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cystoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative cystoscopy is performed to evaluate bladder injury (eg, perforation, bleeding, suture or staple) and confirm urine efflux from both ureteral orifices. Absence or abnormal flow (delayed or sluggish) from one or both ureters warrants further evaluation for ureteral transection or obstruction. Blood coming from a ureteral orifice can also point to ureteral injury and must be investigated. However, cystoscopy does not detect all ureteral injuries; partial ureteral obstruction or transection or thermal injuries may be missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The procedure for diagnostic cystoscopy is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-cystourethroscopy-for-gynecologic-conditions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic cystourethroscopy for gynecologic conditions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Circumstances may arise where a patient undergoing an open procedure in the dorsal supine position is considered at risk for bladder or ureteral injury and cystoscopy is considered. While one option is to re-position and drape the patient in lithotomy position and then proceed, transvesical cystoscopy is another option. A 70 or 30 degree cystoscope can be placed through the dome of the bladder in the operative field and the opening tied with a purse-string suture. Alternately, a simple incision can be made into the dome of the bladder and direct inspection performed. Another option is to position patients in the dorsal lithotomy position before abdominal surgery and use lithotomy stirrups that can adjust from a low to high position plus a self-retaining retractor that does not interfere with elevating the upper thigh. We routinely perform all major abdominal gynecologic and urogynecologic procedures in low lithotomy booty-type stirrups and use a Bookwalter self-retaining retractor to allow us easy access for cystoscopy when needed.

Gynecologic surgeons need to ensure that these early presentations, often with subtle symptoms and signs, are recognized, thereby allowing diagnosis and management. As an example, in a series of 136 ureteral injuries, 17 were discovered intraoperatively, and 50 injuries were discovered within a week of surgery (47 patients within one month and 17 greater than one month after surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/24,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,29</a>].

Obstruction or laceration of the urinary tract are the most common mechanisms of injury. A combination of obstruction and a laceration in the urinary tract may present with a combination of signs and symptoms. There can also be more than one area injured, including a combination of ureteral and bladder injuries. Coincident urinary tract infection often increases the acuity of the presentation and the severity of illness. Intraperitoneal leakage of infected urine or a combination of urinary tract obstruction and infection can lead to severe and quick compromise in a previously healthy adult.</p><p>Complete ureteral obstruction may present with ipsilateral flank pain within 24 hours after surgery. However, many patients may present with pain in other locations or may be asymptomatic. Postoperative analgesics may also mask the pain. Due to these variations in the presentation, clinicians should be vigilant regarding symptoms that suggest ureteral obstruction. Stasis of urine can predispose to pyelonephritis. Partial ureteral obstruction may be asymptomatic, but may progress over time to complete obstruction and result in loss of function in the ipsilateral kidney. Such loss of function may remain silent or be discovered at some point during investigations for other health conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A ureteral or bladder defect with leakage of urine into the peritoneal cavity may present as abdominal pain and ascites. Peritonitis may develop and irritation of the bowel from the urine usually results in ileus. Leakage of urine from the vagina or abdominal incision in the immediate postoperative period after hysterectomy is likely due to drainage of a peritoneal collection of urine. The time course of development of vesicovaginal or ureteral vaginal fistula ranges from days to weeks. Copious serosanguinous drainage from an incision may also signify wound dehiscence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-abdominal-surgical-incisions#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of abdominal surgical incisions&quot;, section on 'Fascial dehiscence'</a>.)</p><p>In the retroperitoneum, a collection may develop into a urinoma; the patient may become febrile due to infection and inflammation associated with this process. Based on the urinary tract anatomy, a retroperitoneal collection is typically due to a ureteral, rather than bladder injury.</p><p>Hematuria may be apparent immediately after the bladder catheter is removed, but this should clear shortly after removal. If bleeding persists or appears remote from the removal of the catheter, urinary tract injury should be suspected. Anuria signifies bilateral ureteral obstruction or transection or other structural or intrinsic renal process (eg, renal failure) and requires immediate evaluation. Oliguria can occur in the setting of ureteral obstruction, but it is not a specific sign because there are other postoperative causes for oliguria after surgery (eg, fluid shifts to the interstitial space).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of postoperative urinary tract injury is made using cystoscopy or imaging studies of the urinary tract.

The urine output for the previous 24-hour period is calculated and the urine inspected for hematuria. The abdomen is assessed for signs of peritonitis, ascites, and the presence of bowel sounds. Following abdominal surgery, the integrity of the abdominal incision(s) is evaluated. A pelvic examination is conducted to rule out a pelvic mass or tenderness and leakage of urine from the vaginal incision(s). The back is examined for costovertebral tenderness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine are measured. </p><p>Bilateral ureteral obstruction results in acute renal failure (acute kidney injury). Unilateral complete obstruction is accompanied by a transient minimal increase in creatinine as the other kidney compensates for the loss of function in the contralateral kidney. A case control study of 15 women with unilateral ureteral obstruction after gynecologic surgery reported that the increase in creatinine from the postoperative value was significantly higher in women with obstruction compared with age- and procedure-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. For the women with ureteral obstruction, at 36 to 48 hours after surgery, the mean increase from the preoperative creatinine was 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> above the preoperative value (range for women with obstruction: 0.3 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> versus controls: -0.2 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>.</p><p>Urinalysis is sent to assess for infection and hematuria, a urine culture is sent if the results suggest infection. Alternatively, a urine culture should be sent without obtaining a urinalysis if the patient is at high risk of infection or if infection is suspected. </p><p>If uroperitoneum (ie, urinary ascites) is suspected, some clinicians obtain a biochemical analysis of the peritoneal fluid by performing paracentesis or sending fluid from an intraperitoneal drain (eg, Jackson-Pratt drain). The results from such testing do not provide direct evidence of urinary tract injury, and confirmation may still be needed with more definitive testing (eg, cystoscopy with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a>, imaging studies). </p><p>Evidence regarding the diagnosis of uroperitoneum is limited to case reports and small case series. As an example, a case series of women in the postoperative period following radical hysterectomy reported mean normal values for urea nitrogen (peritoneal: 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> urine: 469 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and creatinine (peritoneal: 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> urine: 141 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In contrast, in patients with liver cirrhosis, BUN and creatinine concentrations are similar in ascites and serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The values for uroperitoneum will be similar to urine rather than serum (or peritoneal fluid, which has values similar to serum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/32,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34,35</a>].</p><p>If peritoneal fluid is sent for biochemical analysis, the BUN and creatinine of the peritoneal fluid needs to be measured and compared to the patient&rsquo;s serum and urine levels. The results are interpreted as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar values in serum and ascitic fluid (or lower levels in ascitic fluid) is reassuring for the absence of uroperitoneum. However, the patient should be evaluated further if urinary tract injury is still suspected (eg, ureteric obstruction without uroperitoneum). In addition, if significant non-urine ascites is present, the patient may need to be further evaluated for other etiologies.

When ureteral injury is suspected, ultrasonography can be helpful as an initial test to assess for hydronephrosis or to exclude a retroperitoneal collection. We follow this with computed tomography with renal contrast or cystoscopy with retrograde intravenous pyelography, depending on test availability.</p><p>Once a diagnosis of ureteral injury is suspected or confirmed, a retrograde pyelogram can give more information regarding the precise location of the injury. Depending upon the skills and experience of the urologist, ureteral double-J stenting during the retrograde pyelogram as a first-line treatment may manage the injury and avoid the need for more invasive surgery, especially in cases of ureteric obstruction in the postoperative period without large lacerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>If a retroperitoneal, pelvic, or abdominal urinoma is suspected, ultrasonography is the initial imaging study of choice.

In some cases, obstruction or leakage can be managed with ureteral stents, a minimally invasive procedure. Otherwise, surgical exploration is required for repair of the injury. If definitive repair must be delayed, temporary measures (eg, nephrostomy) may be necessary. Ureteral stenting and surgical repair of the urinary tract should be performed by a surgeon with experience with these procedures, often a urologist or urogynecologist. Repair of genitourinary fistula is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urogenital-tract-fistulas-in-women#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urogenital tract fistulas in women&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5748302\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most surgeons do not administer additional antibiotic prophylaxis when a urinary tract injury occurs, whether it is recognized intra- or postoperatively. Urinary tract injury is most likely to occur in major gynecologic procedures for which routinely used antibiotic prophylactic agents (cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, or fluoroquinolones) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87199 \">table 1</a>) cover the enteric gram-negative bacilli that comprise most urinary tract pathogens. There are no high quality data that address this issue. In our practice, if a patient in whom a urinary tract injury occurs has clinical signs suggestive of a urinary tract infection (cloudy urine output from the bladder catheter, malodorous urine, or bladder mucosa that appears inflamed on cystoscopy), we send urine culture during surgery and treat empirically for a urinary tract infection until the culture results are received.</p><p>A bladder catheter is used for several days or weeks in many women following a urinary tract injury. Based upon high quality data, prophylactic antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infection are not required in this setting.

In such cases, the suture is removed and the integrity of the ureter is inspected. Cystoscopy is performed to verify ureteral function. If the efflux from the ureter is absent or abnormal, a surgeon with experience with urinary tract injury, typically a urologist or urogynecologist, should be consulted intraoperatively. If there is doubt regarding the integrity of the ureter, a ureteral stent may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Potential sites of injury to the bladder include the dome, supratrigonal area, trigone, and below the trigone.</p><p>Treatment of thermal bladder injury varies depending upon the extent of injury. This type of injury should be managed by a clinician experienced with thermal urinary tract injury, typically a urologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Bladder dome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When recognized intraoperatively, dome or supratrigonal injuries are usually repaired with excellent results. Delayed identification and repair of injury to the bladder dome are more difficult. If the injury noted is an accidentally placed suture or staple, the foreign material is removed. The bladder should then be re-inspected after removal to confirm no tear has occurred. Similarly, mesh tapes may be inadvertently inserted into the bladder.</p><p>Repair of cystotomy limited to the bladder dome is a straightforward procedure in most patients, but should only be performed by a surgeon with experience with this type of repair. Bladder injury in women in whom primary closure is difficult (eg, vaginal surgery or history of pelvic irradiation) or which is not a simple cystotomy requires intraoperative consultation with an advanced gynecologic or urologic surgeon with skills in these more complicated repairs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management &mdash; Management of a bladder dome cystotomy depends upon the size of the defect. Minimal defects in the bladder dome (eg, a &lt;2 mm injury from pneumoperitoneum needle during laparoscopic surgery) can be managed expectantly. Very small injuries (eg, &lt;1 cm) may either be repaired or managed by leaving the bladder catheter in place for five to seven days, followed by a cystogram to confirm closure. All other cystotomies should be repaired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystotomy repair &ndash; The repair should be delayed until all other surgical dissection is completed, since other injuries may occur. The repair is a one- or two-layered running closure with absorbable suture. We use an absorbable synthetic suture (eg, polyglactin or poliglecaprone). We use one layer for a small cystotomy (eg, &lt;2 cm) or two layers for larger cystotomies. When there are more than one cystostomy in close proximity to each other and well away from the bladder trigone, an option is to incise the small defects to combine them into a single defect before beginning the repair. When the repair is completed, the closure should be tested to see if it is water-tight by instilling dye into the bladder catheter. Additionally, we evaluate the closure with cystoscopy, taking care to not over distend the bladder nor traumatize the suture line with the cystoscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The bladder will reepithelialize within three to four days and regains its normal strength after 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. We usually leave the bladder catheter in for 5 to 14 days, depending on the size and location of the defect. We obtain a cystogram to confirm the injury has healed before removing the catheter, especially for larger cystotomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-tract-injury-in-gynecologic-surgery-identification-and-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Prophylactic antibiotics are not required for these women.

Exposure and suturing of this area are difficult, particularly during abdominal or laparoscopic procedures. This is because the trigone includes the ostia of the ureters and urethra and is located in the inferior and posterior aspect of the bladder.</p><p>When an injury to the trigone occurs, the integrity of the ureters and urethra must be assessed. Ureteral stent placement may be required.

Women with postoperative urinary retention are treated with bladder catheterization. In our experience, normal bladder function will return within several days in most patients.</p><p>Chronic postoperative neurogenic bladder dysfunction can result from procedures that involve extensive dissection and mobilization of the bladder. This type of complication is more likely following extensive perivesical dissection. Radical hysterectomy, for example, interrupts parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation due to resection of the uterosacral and cardinal ligaments. Operative trauma may result in edema and hematoma formation that affects the bladder's functions of urine collection and micturition.</p><p>Management of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is discussed separately.
