However, there is now general agreement that there are complete local renin-angiotensin systems existing entirely within organs or tissues, which function in an autocrine or paracrine fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Aldosterone and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) are also produced by the failing heart, in proportion to the severity of heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure: Neurohumoral adaptations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Synthesis of angiotensin II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiotensin II is an oligopeptide of eight amino acids, formed from its original precursor, angiotensinogen, by a series of two enzymatic cleavages.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensinogen is released into the circulation by the liver. Renin, produced by the kidney, in response to glomerular hypoperfusion, catalyzes cleavage of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, a decapeptide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensin I is in turn cleaved by ACE to produce the octapeptide angiotensin II. The concentration of ACE is highest in the lung and it had been thought that most angiotensin II formation occurred in the pulmonary circulation. It is now clear, however, that ACE is produced in the vascular endothelium of many tissues; thus, angiotensin II can be synthesized at a variety of sites, including the kidney, vascular endothelium, adrenal gland, and brain. In addition, alternative enzymatic pathways not involving ACE may contribute to angiotensin II production. Human heart chymase may be one such enzyme but its clinical significance remains uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Alternate pathways of angiotensin II production'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Angiotensin II binds to its specific receptors and exerts its effects in the brain, kidney, adrenal, vascular wall, and the heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiotensin converting enzyme 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A related enzyme to ACE has been identified and called angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. ACE2 is predominantly expressed in the endothelium of the coronary and intrarenal vessels and the epithelium of the renal tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The gene for ACE2 maps to the X chromosome in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Like ACE, ACE2 acts on angiotensin I. However, the reaction with ACE2 generates angiotensin 1-9 rather than the octapeptide angiotensin II (angiotensin 1-8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Angiotensin 1-9 has no known vascular activity but can be cleaved by ACE to angiotensin 1-7, a vasodilator, and smaller peptides. In contrast to ACE, ACE2 is not inhibited by ACE inhibitors and does not metabolize bradykinin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The physiologic importance of ACE2 is not completely understood. Disruption of the ACE2 gene in mice results in markedly reduced cardiac contractility and upregulation of hypoxia-induced genes in the heart, suggesting a role in the response to cardiac ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Disruption of ACE2 did not interfere with blood pressure regulation.</p><p>The cardiac changes in mice with disruption of the ACE2 gene were associated with increased plasma angiotensin II and were completely reversed by ablation of the ACE genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These observations, plus the demonstration that angiotensin 1-7 is a vasodilator, suggest that ACE2 and ACE have counterbalancing effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ACE GENE POLYMORPHISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphisms are associated with varying responsiveness to ACE inhibitors and a variety of cardiovascular and other conditions, though a clinical role for testing has not been established. Plasma and tissue concentrations of ACE, and therefore levels of angiotensin II, are determined in part by the ACE gene, which is located on chromosome 17. This gene may manifest insertion (I) or deletion (D) polymorphisms and therefore three genotypes (DD, II, and ID). Plasma and cardiac levels of ACE are 1.5- to 3-fold higher in patients with the DD compared with those with II genotype; they are intermediate in patients with ID genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This is concordant with the observation that, in normotensive subjects, the acute effect of an ACE inhibitor is significantly greater and lasts longer in patients with the II ACE genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These data suggest that relatively low doses of ACE inhibitor may be sufficient for patients with low ACE activity and lower levels of angiotensin II while larger doses are required for those with high ACE activity. In addition, the DD genotype is associated with elevated levels of aldosterone, despite therapy with an ACE inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and an increased degradation of bradykinin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The DD genotype has been associated with a variety of adverse cardiovascular effects.

An initial report suggesting an increase in risk of coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] was not confirmed in much larger studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], with the possible exception of specific patient populations such as those with type 2 diabetes mellitus or familial hypercholesterolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p/><p>The impact of ACE gene polymorphism on modification of cardiovascular risk in response to antihypertensive treatment was evaluated in the GenHAT substudy of participants in the ALLHAT trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The AT1 subtype is further subdivided into AT1A and AT1B.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The actions of the AT2 receptor are less well understood. AT2 receptors are expressed in greater abundance in fetal tissues, followed by a decline in expression after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Their role in development has not been elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The AT2 receptor is not found in the skeletal muscle of patients with heart failure, suggesting that the AT2 receptor is unlikely to contribute to the beneficial effects of AT1 receptor antagonism on skeletal muscle vasculature in heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p>One animal study found that the AT2 receptor was a mediator of left ventricular hypertrophy in response to pressure overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The AT2 receptor has also been implicated as an inhibitor of arterial endothelium wall growth when activated by angiotensin II. However, in vivo data in a model of angiotensin II-induced hypertension showed that exposure of a specific inhibitor of the AT2 receptor (PD123319) prevented angiotensin II-induced arterial hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These observations suggest that the AT2 receptor plays a greater role in stimulating growth in the arterial wall.</p><p>The receptor subtypes may also exert different actions on left ventricular function. An animal study evaluated the effects of selective AT1 and AT2 receptor antagonists on the recovery of mechanical function after 30 minutes of global ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The selective AT2 antagonist PD123319 was cardioprotective; when given before ischemia, it improved the recovery of left ventricular work and efficiency. In contrast, selective AT1 antagonism with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> blocked the recovery of left ventricular work and depressed efficiency. However, in another study with a very similar preparation and protocol, selective AT1 antagonism with losartan enhanced the recovery of myocardial function and attenuated the increase in expression of AT1 receptors induced by ischemia-reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Differences in dose and pre-ischemia exposure do not appear to explain the discrepant results.</p><p>Further investigation is required to fully elucidate the action of the angiotensin II receptors in myocardium as well as vascular tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The results of such investigation will have important implications for pharmacologic therapy in several cardiac conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ACE INHIBITORS AND ARBS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been successfully used in the management of a number of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, and post-myocardial infarction. ACE inhibition reduces the amount of angiotensin II available to bind all angiotensin II receptors, while the angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">candesartan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> are specific AT1 receptor antagonists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55726\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55726 \">figure 1</a>). The greater specificity of ARB action may offer some benefits (eg, fewer side effects) but the less specific effects of ACE inhibition may provide other advantages. </p><p>The angiotensin II receptor blockers are effective antihypertensive drugs that lack the side effects of ACE inhibitors resulting from their actions on the bradykinin system (particularly cough and angioedema) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in the treatment of hypertension&quot;</a>). There is substantial evidence that angiotensin II receptor blockers have many of the same clinical benefits as ACE inhibitors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-acute-myocardial-infarction-clinical-trials\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers in acute myocardial infarction: Clinical trials&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blocker-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of angiotensin II receptor blocker in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, there may be differences since some of the benefits of ACE inhibitors may rely on preventing the actions of ACE that are not associated with the AT1 receptor or not associated with angiotensin at all. As an example, increased kinins may contribute to the action of ACE inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. On the other hand, if some angiotensin II is produced by a pathway that circumvents ACE, angiotensin II receptor antagonists might prove to be superior to ACE inhibitors in some settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ANGIOTENSIN II AND HYPERTENSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The actions of circulating angiotensin II contribute to hypertension.

These interactions may contribute to the development of vascular hypertrophy and hypertension, although the mechanisms are not well understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

The net effect on cardiac function depends upon the interplay between the increase in preload (which would tend to increase cardiac output) and enhanced afterload (which would tend to diminish cardiac output).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIRECT CARDIAC EFFECTS OF ANGIOTENSIN II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the systemic, indirect effects of angiotensin II on the heart are complicated, it has frequently been difficult to interpret the cardiac effects of experimental manipulation of the renin-angiotensin system. The weight of evidence, however, supports three main direct effects on the heart: inotropy, chronotropy, and hypertrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Inotropy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inotropic effects of angiotensin II have been demonstrated in numerous species and preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. However, the magnitude of the effects ranges from very small to substantial. Furthermore, studies in some preparations have failed to show positive inotropy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>], emphasizing the need for careful control of confounding factors, such as the autonomic nervous system, temperature, heart rate, preload, and species differences. One study in human myocardium found a positive inotropic effect in the atrium but not the ventricle; the authors suggested that increased atrial contractility may enhance ventricular filling, leading to a rise in stroke volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of a possible inotropic effect of angiotensin II has not been fully resolved and may again be species dependent. Most investigators believe that inotropy is modulated by changes in the intracellular calcium transient which mediates excitation-contraction coupling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=excitation-contraction-coupling-in-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Excitation-contraction coupling in myocardium&quot;</a>). However, others have suggested that an important effect of angiotensin II (in rabbit myocardium) is increasing the calcium-sensitivity of the myofilament, possibly by changing the intracellular pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronotropy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The direct effect of angiotensin II on chronotropy is less clear. The administration of angiotensin II may result in increased or decreased heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These effects are largely indirect, resulting from stimulation of adrenergic nerves or reflex bradycardia induced by increases in vascular resistance and blood pressure. Any consistent direct chronotropic action of angiotensin II is obscured in the clinical setting by these indirect effects, which appear to be of greater magnitude.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is increasing evidence that angiotensin II stimulates hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes, independent of its systemic hemodynamic actions. This effect may be mediated in part by the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The role of angiotensin II in cardiac hypertrophy can be illustrated by the following experimental observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The administration of angiotensin II increased left ventricular mass even if the dose given produced no pressor effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor completely prevented the development of hypertrophy in aortic banded rats, even though afterload was not reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The same effect was not observed with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> or of a calcium channel blocker. Furthermore, if the drugs were administered after the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, only the ACE inhibitor caused regression of the hypertrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy has been demonstrated at the cellular level. In isolated cardiac myocytes, for example, exposure to angiotensin II resulted in increased protein synthesis, an effect that was inhibited by an angiotensin II antagonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The action of angiotensin II may be mediated by release of factors with paracrine activity, for example fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2. As an example, one study found that animals lacking FGF-2 did not develop compensatory hypertrophy in response to angiotensin II-induced hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p>Some data suggest that protein kinase C (PKC) is an intracellular messenger in this response, since angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy is blocked by staurosporine (a specific inhibitor of PKC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The potential physiologic role of angiotensin II in the hypertrophic response is suggested by the findings of another in vitro study. In this model, mechanical stretch directly increased angiotensin II release from cardiac myocytes; the locally released angiotensin II then contributed to the development of stretch-induced hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Role in humans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are data suggesting that these observations apply to human disease. A clinical study evaluated correlates of left ventricular mass in 84 young healthy subjects aged 16 to 24 and provided findings compatible with a direct role for angiotensin II in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

As noted above, experimental manipulation of the renin-angiotensin system in vitro produced results suggestive of a local system operating in myocardium. Each component of the system (renin, angiotensinogen, ACE, and angiotensin II) can be found in myocardium, but ruling out myocardial sequestration of circulating components was not possible by these methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].</p><p>Molecular biology techniques have demonstrated local myocardial synthesis of each component of the system, including the angiotensin II receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>] and ACE binding sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].
