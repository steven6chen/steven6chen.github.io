Retching differs from vomiting in the absence of expulsion of gastric content. In addition, patients may confuse vomiting with regurgitation, which is the return of esophageal contents to the hypopharynx with little effort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The recommendations made in this topic are generally consistent with the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines for nausea and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The pathophysiology of nausea and vomiting and the overall approach to the patient with these symptoms will be reviewed here. The prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and characteristics of antiemetic drugs are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-chemotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of antiemetic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal function of the upper gastrointestinal tract involves an interaction between the gut and the central nervous system. The motor function of the gut is controlled at three main levels: the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems; enteric brain neurons; and smooth muscle cells. A discussion of the anatomy and physiology of gastric motor function is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-delayed-gastric-emptying\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of delayed gastric emptying&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Nausea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies that produce motion sickness in humans indicate how some of the physiologic interactions can cause nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In one report, for example, gastric myoelectrical activity and endogenous neuroendocrine responses were compared in subjects with and without motion sickness elicited by vection (induced by rotating a drum with black and white vertical stripes around seated stationary subjects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thirteen subjects developed tachygastria (an increase in gastric slow wave rhythm) and motion sickness during vection, while nine maintained normal gastric rhythms and remained symptom-free. Nausea followed within minutes of and was proportional to the degree of tachygastria. Anticipatory increases in plasma cortisol and beta endorphin occurred in subjects who developed nausea and gastric tachyarrhythmias; endogenous epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations were also increased in these subjects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Vomiting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vomiting is a reflex that allows an animal or person to rid itself of ingested toxins or poisons. It can be activated by humoral or neuronal stimuli, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Multiple afferent and efferent pathways exist which induce vomiting; the following are the major components of these pathways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The area postrema in the floor of the fourth ventricle which contains a &quot;chemoreceptor trigger zone&quot; that is sensitive to many humoral factors, including neurotransmitters, peptides, drugs, and toxins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An area in the medulla known as the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) which may serve as a central pattern generator for vomiting; information from humoral factors via the area postrema and visceral afferents via the vagus nerve may converge at this site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The central pattern generator presumably projects to the various motor nuclei to elicit the sequential excitation and inhibition that controls the vomiting reflex.</p><p/><p>Vagal afferent nerves from the gastrointestinal tract synapse in the NTS. From there, some neurons extend to the area postrema; other neurons from the NTS ascend to the paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and the limbic and cortical regions, where gastric electromechanical events are perceived as normal sensations or symptoms such as nausea or discomfort. Afferent sympathetic neurons mediating nociceptive stimuli synapse in the spinal cord and ascend to brainstem nuclei and the hypothalamus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F102412\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef102412 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The presence of gastrointestinal and multiple nongastrointestinal trigger areas can result in vomiting with numerous disparate disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78422 \">table 1</a>). Five principle neurotransmitter receptors mediate vomiting: muscarinic M1, dopamine D2, histamine H1<sub> </sub>5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)-3 serotonin, and neurokinin 1 (NK1) substance P [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=characteristics-of-antiemetic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Characteristics of antiemetic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies of vomiting in dogs reveal that gastric content is expelled as a result of gastric and lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, retrograde contraction in the proximal small bowel and antrum, abdominal muscle contraction, and initial cricopharyngeus contraction followed by relaxation seconds before vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Retching occurs when the glottis closes and respiratory muscles counteract abdominal muscle contraction to prevent the expulsion of gastric content.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute vomiting, typically for hours to a few days, most often present to an emergency department, whereas patients with chronic symptoms are more often initially evaluated in outpatient office settings. Emergency department physicians should expeditiously exclude life-threatening disorders such as bowel obstruction, mesenteric ischemia, acute pancreatitis, and myocardial infarction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78422 \">table 1</a>). In both urgent care and routine outpatient settings, the following three steps should generally be undertaken in patients with nausea and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology should be sought, taking into account whether the patient has acute nausea and vomiting or chronic symptoms (at least one month in duration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-nausea-and-vomiting/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The consequences or complications of nausea and vomiting (eg, fluid depletion, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis) should be identified and corrected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted therapy should be provided, when possible (eg, surgery for bowel obstruction or malignancy).

Retching differs from vomiting in the absence of expulsion of gastric content. In addition, patients may confuse vomiting with regurgitation, which is the return of esophageal contents to the hypopharynx with little effort. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The consequences or complications of nausea and vomiting (eg, fluid depletion, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis) should be identified and corrected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology should be sought. A variety of disorders can produce nausea with or without vomiting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78422 \">table 1</a>). The diverse differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting should be approached initially with a careful history and physical examination. In most cases, the cause of the nausea and vomiting can be determined from the history and physical examination and additional testing is not required (eg, in a patient with a history and examination suggestive of gastroenteritis). (See <a href=\"#H558191189\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H558191174\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing should be guided by the symptom duration, frequency, and severity, as well as the characteristics of vomiting episodes and associated symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H558191189\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with chronic nausea and vomiting that is unexplained should undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy to identify disorders that should have specific therapy. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted therapy should be provided, when possible (eg, surgery for bowel obstruction or malignancy). In other cases symptoms should be treated. Few high-quality therapeutic trials have compared the efficacy of different drugs in specified types of nausea and vomiting. However, acute or chronic nausea and vomiting may be helped by antiemetic or prokinetic drugs depending upon the underlying cause.
