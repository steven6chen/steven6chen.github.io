One or more conditions can coexist in an individual. The inability to achieve <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual intercourse is a distressing and common symptom, affecting up to one-third of adult men.</p><p>ED is common in men with systemic disorders such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus, and its prevalence increases with age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107343 \">figure 1</a>).

Health professionals should therefore ask men of all ages about sexual dysfunction as part of their routine psychosocial assessment.

It increases with age, and it frequently accompanies other types of sexual dysfunction. Men with erectile dysfunction (ED) may experience loss of libido as a secondary consequence of ED. This usually is ascertained from a detailed sexual history, including the chronology of the disorder. However, most patients who complain of ED do not complain of reduced libido or sexual desire. Low libido is often secondary to medications, depression, systemic illness, or testosterone deficiency, but it can also be due to psychogenic causes. Most of these conditions are potentially treatable.</p><p>The most common causes of decreased libido are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychological, which is treated with formal or informal psychotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H2242085558\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low testosterone, which is treated with testosterone replacement therapy.

Treatment strategies for SSRI-associated sexual side effects are reviewed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males&quot;, section on 'Continuous opiate administration'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partner interactions.</p><p/><p>A small but significant percentage of men who use 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dutasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dutasteride</a>) to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or male-pattern baldness experience a decrease in libido, ED, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ejaculatory dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Depending upon the diagnosis, it may be possible to stop the drug to see if this improves the man's libido. In one report of men ages 18 to 45 years, persistent sexual dysfunction with finasteride therapy was associated with a possible increased risk of suicidal ideation. However, this association is not well established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Making the patient aware of this association may help to reduce or stop the excessive alcohol intake; however, professional counseling usually is required. Low libido may also be a function of partner issues. For example, marital strife, marital guilt, or a naturally or surgically induced postmenopausal female partner who has diminished or absent sexual interest can create low libido in the male partner.

(See <a href=\"#H268669529\" class=\"local\">'Choice of drug'</a> below.)</p><p>The rationale for the use of PDE5 inhibitors is based upon the role of nitric oxide-induced vasodilation, which is mediated by cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) in initiating and maintaining an erection; detumescence is associated with catabolism of cyclic GMP by the PDE5 enzyme. PDE5 inhibitors act by increasing intracavernosal cyclic GMP levels by competitively inhibiting the PDE5 enzyme and, as a result, increase both the number and duration of erections in men with ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. PDE5 inhibitors will not work without sufficient environmental and psychological cues that result in sufficient sexual arousal and stimulation to initiate the physiological changes in the penis.

PDE inhibitors are contraindicated in men taking nitrates and should be used cautiously in men receiving an alpha-adrenergic blocker.</p><p>Erectile function can be objectively measured using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), the commonly used validated instrument to assess male sexual function in clinical ED studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F98030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98030 \">table 5</a>). A subset of the 15 IIEF questions (questions 1 through 5 and question 15) are termed the erectile function domain of the IIEF. Survey scores of men with ED are significantly lower than men without ED. IIEF scores remain low in placebo-treated men but may be comparable, in some treated men, with normal, healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This is true even for men who have multiple factors contributing to their ED. A short form of the IIEF (the IIEF-5 or Sexual Health Inventory for Men [SHIM]) is a brief, more easily administered, and practical diagnostic tool in a clinical practice setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97456 \">table 6</a>).</p><p>In the clinical trial setting, an increase of &ge;4 on the erectile function domain of the IIEF is considered a minimally clinically important difference (MCID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>An important factor in the success of PDE5 inhibitor therapy is instruction and counseling on proper use, including onset of action of the drug and taking medications on an empty stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F80719\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80719 \">table 2A</a>).

ED and low testosterone levels often coexist in middle-aged and older men. Measurement of serum testosterone is recommended by some groups for men with ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and testosterone replacement has been shown to improve libido, sexual activity, and erectile function in hypogonadal men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/85-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-87</a>].

Testosterone therapy was associated with an improvement in erectile function (as measured by IIEF) when compared with placebo.

Compounded penile injections of Trimix are commonly utilized penile injections mainly due to excellent efficacy, cost, and finer ability to titrate the dose. It should be noted that compounded penile injections are considered off-label use. All penile injections, whether compounded or commercially available, increase the risk for penile plaque development, and patients should be counseled about this potential risk.</p><p>The sympathetic nervous system normally maintains the penis in a flaccid or nonerect state. Vasodilator drugs, when injected into the corpora cavernosa, inhibit or override sympathetic vasoconstriction and act as direct smooth muscle vasodilators. The relaxation of the smooth muscle trabeculae within the penile erectile bodies leads to an increase in blood flow to the penis. The increased inflow of blood engorges the penile corpora cavernosa sinusoidal spaces with sufficient pressure to compress the emissary veins that normally drain blood from the penis. The combination of accelerated arterial inflow and impeded venous outflow from the corpora cavernosa creates an erection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60979\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60979 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>Considerable education is required for men to become facile with penile self-injection.
