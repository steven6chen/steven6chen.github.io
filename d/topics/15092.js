These tumors can arise in many anatomic locations and can resemble fat, fibrous tissue, and muscle. Overall, these pediatric tumors are rare, accounting for approximately 7 percent of all childhood cancers; they have an estimated incidence of 11 per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review will cover the epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of a specific type of pediatric soft tissue sarcoma: rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Clinical manifestations, diagnostic evaluation, staging, and risk-adapted therapy for RMS are discussed elsewhere, as are primary tumors of bone and other soft tissue neoplasms arising in children as well as adults. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue tumor of childhood and is responsible for approximately one-half of all soft tissue sarcomas in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, they are rare, representing only 3 to 4 percent of pediatric cancers overall. Approximately 350 new cases are diagnosed in the United States each year, and the annual incidence in children, adolescents, and young adults under the age of 20 is 4.3 cases per one million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Two-thirds of cases are diagnosed in children younger than six years of age, and there is a small male predominance (male to female ratio between 1.3 and 1.5). The incidence in black patients is higher than in whites, most notably in 15 to 19 year olds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The incidence appears to be lower in Asians when compared with predominantly Caucasian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Although RMS can arise anywhere in the body, distinct patterns link primary site, histology, and age at diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head and neck RMS are more common in younger children; when they arise in the orbit, they are almost always of the embryonal type. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Histologic classification'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly 80 percent of genitourinary tract RMS are embryonal. The botryoid variant (sarcoma botryoides), a unique form of embryonal RMS arising within the wall of the bladder or vagina, is seen almost exclusively in infants. However, it can arise within the nasopharynx in older children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremity tumors present more commonly in adolescents and are frequently of the alveolar type.

A few epidemiologic reports suggest a higher incidence of RMS in individuals exposed to radiation in utero, those with accelerated in utero growth, children from families with a low socioeconomic status, those who received antibiotics soon after birth, and those whose parents used recreational drugs during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. However, these associations have not been confirmed by other studies. A protective role for higher birth order, immunizations, and immune-related factors (allergies, atopy, daycare attendance, breastfeeding for 12 or more months) has also been suggested, but it requires confirmation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Inherited syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of RMS appear to be sporadic, but the disease has been associated with familial syndromes, such as neurofibromatosis and the Li-Fraumeni, Beckwith-Wiedemann, and Costello syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-19</a>]. In a study that used next-generation sequencing to determine the contribution of germline predisposition mutations in 1120 children with cancer, mutations that were deemed to be pathogenic or probably pathogenic were identified in 3 of 43 (7 percent) patients with RMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an inherited condition in which members of affected families are predisposed to a spectrum of cancers, including soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas, adrenocortical and brain tumors, leukemias, and breast cancer in adult relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Many of these families have germline inactivating mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, whose normal function involves cell cycle regulation and the maintenance of genomic integrity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=li-fraumeni-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Li-Fraumeni syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite this association, the likelihood that an individual RMS is attributable to Li-Fraumeni syndrome is small and may be greatest among younger children. This was illustrated in a series of 33 RMS cases in which evidence for a germline p53 mutation was found in 3 of 13 children under three years of age compared with none of 20 children over the age of three [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These provocative findings suggest that children who develop RMS at a young age might be at higher risk for a hereditary predisposition syndrome; therefore, screening for germline p53 mutations in children younger than three years should be considered. Furthermore, if a p53 germline mutation is identified, it raises the issue of whether the treatment protocol should be modified to reduce exposure to ionizing radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapeutic agents, which may be associated with an increased risk for secondary malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Less well-differentiated alveolar RMS may feature only a suggestion of fine fissuring or micro-alveoli; molecular techniques may aid in the diagnosis of such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Anaplastic RMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaplastic RMS is defined by the presence of large hyperchromatic nuclei with atypical bizarre mitotic figures. The nuclear size is threefold larger than that of adjacent &quot;typical&quot; tumor cells. As stated above, this subtype is seen most often in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The two major histologic subtypes, alveolar and embryonal RMS, reflect distinct clinical and molecular entities that may arise through distinct biologic mechanisms. The characteristic genetic alterations are presumed to play some role in their pathogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Alveolar RMS and chromosome translocations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alveolar RMS presents throughout childhood in the trunk and extremities, and harbors distinguishing chromosomal translocations, as occurs with several other sarcomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64666\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64666 \">table 2</a>). The most common translocation occurs between the long arms of chromosome 2 and 13, t(2;13)(q35;q14), and fuses the <em>PAX3</em> gene (which normally functions as a transcription regulator during early neuromuscular development) with the <em>FOXO1</em> gene, a transcription factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. A less common translocation, t(1;13)(p36;q14), fuses a different gene, the <em>PAX7</em> gene located on chromosome 1, with <em>FOXO1</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. It is hypothesized that these unique fusion genes in some way activate the transcription of other genes that contribute to the transformed phenotype, although the mechanisms by which this occurs are just beginning to be elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenetic-factors-in-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcomas#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenetic factors in soft tissue and bone sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma'</a>.)</p><p>Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are available that detect the presence of either of these fusion genes, which may be used to support the diagnosis of alveolar RMS. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a <em>FOXO1</em> probe is a fast and accurate test to identify both translocations as well. In one Children's Oncology Group (COG) study, <em>PAX3-FOXO1</em> and <em>PAX7-FOXO1</em> fusion transcripts were identified in 55 and 22 percent of alveolar RMS, respectively, while 23 percent were fusion negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Identification of the fusion gene may be particularly helpful for tumors with equivocal or nondiagnostic light microscopic and immunohistochemical (IHC) findings.</p><p>The type of fusion gene is of clinical relevance. Patients with a <em>PAX7-FOXO1 </em>translocation tend to be younger and more likely to present with an extremity lesion, and may have a better outcome compared with those with the <em>PAX3-FOXO1</em> translocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>With current COG protocols, diagnosis is based upon fusion gene status rather than histology alone. Assessment for <em>FOXO1</em> rearrangement by FISH or RT-PCR is required to provide a diagnosis of alveolar RMS for risk stratification purposes, regardless of the histomorphologic features. Therefore, FISH or RT-PCR for <em>FOXO1</em> rearrangement is performed on all RMS tumors. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Molecular classification and risk stratification'</a> below.)</p><p>There are additional rare translocations and genetic abnormalities that have been described in alveolar RMS. The relatively rare novel translocations include <em>PAX3</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>FOXO4</em>,</span> <em>PAX3</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>NCOA1</em>,</span> <em>PAX3</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>NCOA2</em>,</span> and <em>FOXO1</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>FGFR1</em></span>. In addition, <em>CDK4</em> amplification, mutations in <em>TP53</em>, <em>CDKN2A</em>, <em>CDKN2B</em>, and <em>FGFR4</em>, and <em>ALK</em> copy gains have been identified. Both tumor suppressor mutations (<em>RASSF</em>, <em>HIC1</em>, <em>CASP8</em>) and DNA methylation play a role in the pathogenesis of alveolar RMS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Embryonal type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embryonal RMS typically occurs in young children, mainly in the head, neck, and genitourinary sites. While specific translocations have not been identified, most embryonal RMS have loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the 11p15 locus, the site of the <em>IGF-II</em> gene. <em>IGF-II</em> is an imprinted gene, meaning that only the paternal allele is transcriptionally active. It is thought that 11p LOH leads to loss of maternal genetic information with duplication of paternal genetic information (paternal disomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>Embryonal RMS overproduce insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), a factor that stimulates the growth of these tumors in vitro and whose inhibition is accompanied by growth repression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Alveolar RMS also overexpress <em>IGF-II</em>, at least the subset with the <em>PAX3-FOXO1</em> translocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Taken together, these data suggest that upregulated <em>IGF-II</em> expression plays an important role in the growth of RMS, regardless of histology.</p><p>The mechanism responsible for <em>IGF-II</em> overexpression in embryonal RMS is unclear. One possibility is a loss of imprinting at this locus, with re-expression of the normally silent maternal <em>IGF-II</em> allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Loss of imprinting with biallelic expression (ie, expression of both maternal and paternal alleles) and 11p LOH with paternal disomy could both lead to a double-gene dose effect, potentially resulting in <em>IGF-II</em> overexpression.</p><p>Of note, the 11p15.5 locus harbors important genes that may be altered in embryonal RMS, including <em>H19</em>, <em>CDKN1C</em>, and <em>HOTS</em> in addition to <em>IGF-II</em>. Certain mutations (<em>pRb</em>, <em>TP53</em>, <em>GLI</em>, <em>CDKN2A</em>, <em>CDKN2B</em>, <em>RAS</em>, <em>FGFR4</em>, <em>PIK3CA</em>, <em>CTNNB1</em> [beta-catenin], <em>MyoD1</em>) and a deletion in the <em>NF1</em> gene may be present.</p><p>Additional genetic abnormalities may include <em>ALK</em> copy gain and DNA methylation aberrations.</p><p>With the spindle cell variant of embryonal RMS in neonates and infants less than one year of age, unique translocations may be present. Rearrangements of <em>VGLL2</em> and <em>NCOA2</em> are characteristic of this variant of embryonal RMS. The gene fusions include <em>VGLL2-CITED2</em>, <em>VGLL2-NC0A2</em>, <em>TEAD1-NCOA2</em>, <em>PAX3-NCOA2</em>, <em>PAX3-NCOA2</em>, and <em>SRF-NCOA2</em>. These unique translocations are helpful in defining this variant of embryonal RMS, which tends to have a favorable outcome.</p><p>In contrast, spindle cell RMS and sclerosing RMS in children older than one year of age tend to have an aggressive course and unfavorable outcome. These subsets of embryonal RMS are defined by mutations in <em>MyoD1</em> and <em>PIK3CA</em>, and in some cases, mutations in both these genes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Other pathways</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities in a variety of other molecular pathways have been described in RMS (eg, <em>TP53</em>, <em>RAS</em>, <em>RB1</em>, and <em>PTCH</em> gene mutations, <em>MDM2</em>, <em>CDK4</em>, and <em>MYCN</em> amplification, abnormalities in the basic helix-loop-helix [bHLH] myogenic differentiation family of proteins). The interactions between these molecular changes, <em>PAX</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>FOXO1</em></span> translocations, and 11p LOH are areas of active investigation. It remains unclear how any of these molecular abnormalities lead to the failure of terminal myogenic differentiation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malignant transformation in RMS. A complete discussion of this subject is beyond the scope of this review, and several contemporary references are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular classification and risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of RMS is selected according to a risk-based algorithm, which historically has combined histologic classification (embryonal versus alveolar) with presurgical stage and postsurgical clinical group. However, histologic classification is not always straightforward. RMS is defined as showing at least minimal evidence of skeletal muscle differentiation by IHC or transmission electron microscopy (TEM), but in a large proportion of cases, morphologic evidence of muscle differentiation is limited to a small percentage of tumor cells or may be extremely difficult to detect. Furthermore, although molecular detection of the chimeric transcription factors PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1, which are found exclusively in alveolar RMS, was initially thought to provide an objective basis for distinguishing between the two major forms of the disease (alveolar versus embryonal), up to 45 percent of RMS with alveolar morphology lack <em>FOXO1</em> rearrangement or another unique gene fusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Current clinical practice has evolved away from using histology alone to classify these tumors, and this has been replaced by an assessment of the presence or absence of the characteristic fusion gene. For patients with fusion-negative tumors, current practice is evolving toward molecular classification based upon gene expression, which may offer a more clinically relevant diagnostic scheme, improving patient management and therapeutic RMS outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhabdomyosarcoma-in-childhood-and-adolescence-epidemiology-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/66,70-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,70-73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Two-thirds of cases are diagnosed in children under the age of six. The etiology and risk factors are unknown. Most cases of RMS appear to be sporadic, but the disease has been associated with familial syndromes (neurofibromatosis and the Li-Fraumeni, Beckwith-Wiedemann, and Costello syndromes). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morphologically, the appearance of RMS is similar to that of other small round blue cell tumors of childhood that involve bone and soft tissue, such as lymphoma, small cell osteosarcoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, and the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors. Advanced immunohistochemical, molecular genetic, or ultrastructural techniques may be needed to definitively establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Tissue diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four major histologic subtypes of RMS are identified, a distinction that is important for both treatment and prognosis: embryonal, botryoid, alveolar, and undifferentiated. The embryonal subtype is most common. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Histologic classification'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some alveolar RMS harbor distinguishing chromosomal translocations, as occurs with several other sarcomas. The fusion gene products of these translocations can be identified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which must be used to support the diagnosis of this subtype. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Alveolar RMS and chromosome translocations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While specific translocations have not been identified in typical embryonal RMS, most embryonal RMS have loss of heterozygosity at the 11p15 locus, the site of the <em>IGF-II</em> gene. More recently, the <span class=\"nowrap\">congenital/infantile</span> spindle cell variant of embryonal RMS has been identified with tumor-defining translocations involving <em>NCOA2</em> and <em>VGLL2</em> genes. This variant of embryonal RMS occurs in neonates and infants less than one year of age, and has a favorable outcome. With children older than one year of age, spindle cell and sclerosing RMS (variants of embryonal RMS) with <em>MyoD1</em> and <em>PIK3CA </em>gene mutations occur. These tumors tend to be aggressive with a poor prognosis.

Histologic classification is not always straightforward, and clinical practice has evolved and now includes information on the presence or absence of the characteristic fusion genes. FISH or RT-PCR for <em>FOXO1</em> rearrangement is performed on all RMS tumors. Assessment for <em>FOXO1</em> rearrangement by FISH or RT-PCR is required to provide a diagnosis of alveolar RMS for risk stratification purposes, regardless of the histomorphologic features.
