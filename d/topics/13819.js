In the revised nomenclature, this disease, which comprises 20 to 30 percent of patients with JIA, is included in the group termed &quot;childhood polyarthritis.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, course, complications, and prognosis of polyarticular JIA are reviewed here. The treatment of polyarticular JIA is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516508839\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyarticular JIA is more frequent in females than males. There is a bimodal distribution of the age at onset. The first peak is between the ages of two and five years, and the second is between 10 and 14 years. This age distribution suggests that two or more distinct diseases may be included in this classification. The classification, epidemiology, and immunopathogenesis of JIA are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-epidemiology-and-immunopathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Epidemiology and immunopathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of polyarticular JIA is varied, although it tends to fall into patterns based upon the age of onset.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Younger children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children less than 10 years of age, polyarticular JIA often begins similarly to oligoarticular disease, with one or two joints affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The development of the disease is often indolent until an intercurrent infection precipitates a dramatic increase in symptoms. The disease then becomes relentlessly progressive, spreading to involve five or more joints within the first six months after disease onset. Joint involvement is symmetric, with the knees, wrists, and ankles most frequently affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There are typically periods of apparent response to therapy followed by relapses with an increasing number of involved joints. Polyarticular JIA may go unrecognized at first because of its initial indolent course. This failure to recognize the initial symptoms may make it appear that the disease had a sudden onset and rapid progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Older children and adolescents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These patients usually have a relatively rapid onset of inflammation in multiple joints, including involvement of the many small joints of the hands and feet, within two to three months of disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pain in the small joints is a common manifestation of polyarticular JIA and initially may be out of proportion to the degree of inflammation and stiffness. The joints of the fingers, wrists, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles are most commonly affected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516508956\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no diagnostic laboratory findings for polyarticular JIA. Rather, it is a clinical diagnosis. However, the following findings may be observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour),</span> anemia (hemoglobin concentration &le;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> and hypergammaglobulinemia may be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many children in the younger age group are antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive. The ANA is often low in titer and homogeneous in pattern. The presence of ANA is unrelated to the severity of arthritis and is meaningful only as a marker for an increased risk of developing uveitis. Other autoantibodies are not usually seen in patients with polyarticular JIA, and their presence should prompt evaluation for other rheumatologic disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-and-clinical-significance-of-antinuclear-antibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement and clinical significance of antinuclear antibodies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ocular'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies to double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA), Smith (Sm), Sj&ouml;gren-syndrome-related antigen A (SSA or Ro), Sj&ouml;gren-syndrome-related antigen B (SSB or La), or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) are not expected in children with polyarticular JIA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive rheumatoid factor (RF) is uncommon in children &lt;10 years of age. Positive results should be confirmed three months after the original test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Children with onset of polyarticular disease after 10 years of age may be divided by the presence or absence of RF (eg, polyarthritis RF negative and polyarthritis RF positive) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most children with polyarticular-onset disease are RF negative, and it is rare for these children to have antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Their disease is probably not etiologically similar to adult-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Older children with RF are more likely to be female and tend to have more severe disease, mimicking their adult counterparts with RA. Some of these children may be human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4 positive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have anti-CCP antibodies, which put them at risk for an aggressive disease course in the absence of appropriate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>].

Other causes of arthritis must be excluded, primarily based upon clinical history and exam findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are no specific diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-juvenile-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of juvenile arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyarticular JIA must be distinguished from a variety of illnesses that may be self-limited or chronic in nature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97194389\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactive arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with serum sickness, viral infections, and many other forms of reactive arthritis may have polyarthritis. These conditions are excluded by recognition of the associated events and by their generally self-limited nature. The rapidity of the onset of polyarticular disease in these conditions often helps to distinguish them from true JIA. A rapid onset of polyarthritis within a period of days to weeks is more characteristic of reactive arthritis in childhood, although some children with polyarticular JIA present with a history of apparent sudden-onset disease due to a failure to recognize the initial symptoms of the arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-sickness-and-serum-sickness-like-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum sickness and serum sickness-like reactions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-viruses-that-cause-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific viruses that cause arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Younger children'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97194427\"><span class=\"h2\">Psoriatic JIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with early-onset psoriatic arthritis can present with polyarthritis. The asymmetric pattern of joint involvement, the presence of a positive family history of psoriasis, axial symptoms, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of prominent enthesitis (inflammation at tendon, ligament, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> joint capsule insertion sites) are features that differentiate psoriatic JIA from polyarticular JIA. Dactylitis (uniform swelling of a single digit, sometimes referred to as a sausage digit) is a common finding in patients with psoriatic JIA, but it is also reported in nonpsoriatic JIA. Children with dactylitis followed by progression to polyarticular disease and a family history of psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis are often suspected to have psoriatic JIA, but there are not always sufficient criteria for that classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, they are given the diagnosis of polyarticular JIA. However, many go on to develop psoriasis and are reclassified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoriatic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97195655\"><span class=\"h2\">Enthesitis-related JIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spondyloarthropathies may also be difficult to differentiate from polyarticular JIA. Similar to psoriatic JIA, the asymmetric pattern of joint involvement, the presence of a positive family history of spondylitis, axial symptoms, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of prominent enthesitis are useful distinguishing features. Distinguishing between these two forms of JIA is important because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> is ineffective for axial manifestations of spondyloarthropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] but is recommended for JIA before anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. Anti-TNF agents are effective for spondyloarthropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].

The International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria require that RF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-CCP antibodies are found twice on serologic testing, three months apart, before making the diagnosis of RA in a child because of concerns about false-positive test results. However, these children should be treated appropriately for possible RA without waiting three months for confirmatory testing results.

Additional features that differentiate SLE and mixed connective tissue from polyarticular JIA are the involvement of other organs, especially the skin, and hematologic abnormalities including leukopenia, lymphopenia, or thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97194841\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic vasculitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic vasculitis also may manifest with polyarthritis. Evidence of a vasculitic rash or additional end-organ involvement (especially renal or pulmonary) may help to identify children with vasculitis. As an example, two girls who were initially diagnosed with polyarticular JIA subsequently developed antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive glomerulonephritis, consistent with an ANCA-associated vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Significant hilar adenopathy is not common in children with sarcoid arthritis and therefore cannot be relied upon to confirm the diagnosis. However, hypercalcemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent, unexplained liver enzyme elevations are suggestive of sarcoid arthritis. In addition, angiotensin-converting enzyme levels are often elevated in children with sarcoid, especially those with pulmonary involvement. Uveitis, including inflammation of the posterior pole that is distinct from the anterior uveitis seen in juvenile arthritis, is another characteristic feature of juvenile sarcoidosis. Radiographically, sarcoid arthritis is unusually destructive.

Joint replacement is indicated in children of any age who are nonambulatory or severely limited in ambulation as a result of arthritis. Nonetheless, preservation of the native joint is preferable, particularly in young patients, because the functional life expectancy of an artificial articulation is only 10 to 15 years and joint replacement can affect long bone growth due to loss of the growth plate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Osteopenia and osteoporosis</strong> &ndash; Osteopenia and osteoporosis may occur among those with polyarticular JIA, even in the absence of glucocorticoid exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In one study of 103 adolescents with JIA who underwent total body imaging, 41 and 34 percent had low total body bone mineral content and bone mineral density, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Vertebral compression fractures can occur, particularly in patients with refractory disease. In one series of patients with severe JIA, risk factors for vertebral compression fractures included high disease activity, body mass index, and recent cumulative glucocorticoid dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. There was no association with bone mineral density or disease duration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Temporomandibular joint involvement</strong> &ndash; Involvement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) may lead to micrognathia even in the absence of symptoms. Predictors of radiographic damage of the TMJ are pain with TMJ motion and the finding of limited forward movement of the mandibular condyle (limited translation) with mouth opening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The evolution of TMJ involvement is often slow and virtually imperceptible. In one study of 32 patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often demonstrated TMJ involvement, even in patients who were asymptomatic and had normal examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. TMJ abnormalities were found in 70 percent of adults with JIA assessed with MRI or computed tomography (CT) imaging, including 8 of 21 patients with polyarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">TMJ involvement is treated in the same way as other joint disease. However, if significant micrognathia develops, surgical correction may be required. This intervention is not undertaken until the facial bones are fully developed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Problems related to mobility</strong> &ndash; While flexion contractures, weakness, and difficulty with ambulation were frequent complications of polyarticular JIA prior to the introduction of biologic agents, severe mobility problems are rare with adequate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Children presenting with these problems should be referred for physical therapy in addition to re-evaluating their treatment regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uveitis is seen in polyarticular JIA, although it is less common than in oligoarticular JIA (14 versus 20 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The uveitis is typically isolated to the anterior chamber and is completely asymptomatic. Periodic slit-lamp ophthalmic examination is required for screening and detection. Screening for uveitis in children with JIA is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis#H5062896\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis&quot;, section on 'Uveitis'</a>.)</p><p>The serologic marker most strongly associated with uveitis is antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Thus, children who are ANA positive are screened more often than those who are ANA negative, although children with polyarticular JIA who are ANA negative are still at risk. In contrast to ANA, children with rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative polyarticular JIA are more likely to develop uveitis than those who are RF positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/31,32,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,35</a>]. The risk is further increased in children with RF-negative polyarticular JIA who are diagnosed at a young age (less than six years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-complications/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Visceral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Internal organ involvement is rare. Although many of these children suffer from chronic anemia and malaise, these symptoms typically resolve with successful control of the underlying synovitis.

The first peak in incidence is between the ages of two and five years, and the second peak is between 10 and 14 years. It is more common in females than males at all ages. (See <a href=\"#H516508839\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of polyarticular JIA is varied and tends to fall into patterns based upon the age of onset. In children less than 10 years of age, polyarticular JIA often begins similarly to oligoarticular disease, with one or two joints affected. The development of the disease is often indolent until an intercurrent infection precipitates a dramatic increase in symptoms. The disease then becomes relentlessly progressive, spreading to involve five or more joints during the first six months after disease onset. Joint involvement is typically symmetrical. Older children and adolescents usually have a relatively rapid onset of inflammation in multiple joints, including involvement of the many small joints of the hands and feet, within two to three months of disease onset. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no diagnostic laboratory findings for JIA. However, patients often have a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour),</span> anemia (hemoglobin concentration &le;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> and hypergammaglobulinemia may be present. Other autoantibodies are not usually seen in patients with polyarticular JIA. (See <a href=\"#H516508956\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is made in children with arthritis in more than four joints during the first six months of disease and in whom other causes of polyarthritis have been excluded. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H516508956\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes a number of illnesses that may be self-limited or chronic in nature, including other forms of JIA (eg, psoriatic, systemic, enthesitis related), reactive arthritis, early-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic vasculitis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), epiphyseal dysplasia, and minocycline-induced autoimmunity. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications include debilitating arthritis, uveitis, and osteoporosis.
