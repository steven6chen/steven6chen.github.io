Urothelial (transitional cell) carcinomas of the renal pelvis account for approximately 8 percent of kidney tumors, and other parenchymal epithelial tumors, such as oncocytomas, collecting duct tumors, and renal sarcomas, are rare. Nephroblastoma (Wilms' tumor) is common in children (5 to 6 percent of primary renal tumors). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancies of the renal pelvis and ureter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When patients with RCC present with localized disease, surgical resection can be curative. Unfortunately, many RCCs are clinically silent for much of their natural history. Thus, the diagnosis is frequently not made until disease is either locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic. Furthermore, many patients who initially are resectable eventually recur. The prognosis for long-term disease-free survival for patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC is generally poor.</p><p>The factors affecting prognosis in patients with RCC will be reviewed here. An overview of the approach to treatment is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC EXTENT OF DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2017 (eighth) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system is used to assess the anatomic extent of disease and define prognostic stage groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110735 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The anatomic extent of disease is the most consistent factor that influences prognosis in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59133\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59133 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and staging of renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'TNM staging system'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1056314655\"><span class=\"h2\">Stage I/II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with stage I RCC have a five-year survival rate over 90 percent in most contemporary series. The survival rate may be slightly lower for patients with stage II disease, with reported five-year survival rates ranging from 75 to 95 percent.</p><p>Patients with stage I or II RCC that invades the urinary collecting system appear to have a significantly worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a multivariate analysis of a series of 1124 cases of RCC, the 10-year survival rates for patients with T1 or T2 primary lesions that invaded the urinary collecting system were 43 and 41 percent, respectively (hazard ratio 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-7.1).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1056314662\"><span class=\"h2\">Stage III</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported five-year survival rate for patients with stage III RCC who undergo nephrectomy ranges from 59 to 70 percent. There are conflicting data about whether extension into the perinephric fat (T3a) alone adversely affects prognosis. Two large studies could not demonstrate a difference when T3a primary tumors were compared with comparably sized T1 and T2 primary tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. By contrast, involvement of perinephric fat remained a prognostic factor in two other series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Among patients with T3a disease, the size of the primary tumor remains a prognostic factor (ten-year survival rates of 77, 54, and 46 percent for tumors &lt;4, 4 to 7, and &gt;7 cm, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Patients with involvement of the renal vein or inferior vena cava are included in the group with stage III RCC. Although some early studies have not identified an adverse impact of renal vein involvement on prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], other reports found that the extent of vena cava invasion and the anatomic location of the tumor thrombus were important prognostic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The extent of venous involvement is recognized as a prognostic factor in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system, with T3a tumors having tumor invasion of the renal vein or its branches, T3b having gross involvement of the inferior vena cava (IVC) below the diaphragm, and T3c lesions have tumor invading the wall of the IVC or grossly extending into the IVC above the diaphragm.</p><p>In addition, invasion of the urine collecting system also appears to be a prognostic factor in patients with stage III RCC. In a series of 303 cases with stage III disease, multivariate analysis found that patients with urine collecting system invasion had significantly worse disease-specific and overall survival compared with those without invasion (five-year rates 34 versus 59 percent and 30 versus 52 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1056314683\"><span class=\"h2\">Stage IV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the median survival for patients with stage IV disease was a little over one year when cytokines were the predominant systemic therapies, analyses from the International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) based upon more than 2200 patients treated with targeted therapies report a median survival of 28 months in patients who were eligible for clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another contemporary trial (COMPARZ) using targeted therapy reported median survival 28 to 29 months in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pazopanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pazopanib</a>, mirroring the IMDC results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1056314835\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether the tumor subtype (ie, clear cell versus papillary or chromophobe carcinoma) affects prognosis is controversial. A multi-institution study failed to identify a prognostic difference in over 4000 patients when tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage, histologic grade, and performance status were considered in a multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In contrast, multivariate analyses of single-institution series from the Mayo Clinic and from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Institute, including 3062 and 1668 patients, respectively, both found that patients with clear cell histology had significantly poorer cancer-specific survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Some less common variants, including collecting duct carcinomas, sarcomatoid clear cell carcinomas, and renal medullary carcinomas, are considered more aggressive and are associated with a shorter survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Multiple systems are used to grade renal cell carcinoma (RCC), of which the Fuhrman's grade is the most widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In one report, the five-year survival rate based upon tumor grade was 89, 65, and 46 percent for tumors of histologic grade 1, 2, and 3 to 4, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H298307\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor necrosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic coagulative tumor necrosis is an independent predictor of outcome for clear cell and chromophobe RCC, and should be routinely reported. It also part of several integrated staging systems like the Stage, Size, Grade, and Necrosis (SSIGN) score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the anatomic extent of disease, clinical factors can influence survival. Adverse prognostic signs include a poor performance status, the presence of symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paraneoplastic syndromes (eg, anemia, hypercalcemia, hepatopathy, thrombocytosis, fever, weight loss), and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/20,27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,27-32</a>]. Although younger patients (ie, 20 to 40 years old) are more likely to be symptomatic at presentation, their outcome may be slightly better due to a lower incidence of nodal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Multiple models have been developed to integrate the information from anatomic staging with histopathology and clinical prognostic parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. The most widely studied prognostic model has been the UCLA integrated staging system (UISS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77502 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The UISS incorporates the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 3</a>) and Fuhrman's histologic grade (1 through 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]) into the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) anatomic staging system. Using these variables, five distinct prognostic categories were identified that correlate with post-nephrectomy outcome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66352\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66352 \">figure 2</a>). The value of this system has subsequently been validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/20,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR MARKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of tissue microarrays permits the evaluation of the histologic and immunohistochemical features of multiple tumors simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

Main results suggested that worse survival is associated with upregulation of the fatty acid synthesis genes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN), as well as upregulation of multiple genes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway. On the other hand, a better survival was associated with upregulation of adenosine monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK) and multiple genes involved in the Krebs cycle and the mTOR pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>These data enabled the identification of four prognostic signatures for RCC, which appear to represent metabolic states of tumors and their variable usage of key pathways and metabolites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F89968%7EONC%2F89913%7EONC%2F89969\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89968 graphicRef89913 graphicRef89969 \">figure 3A-C</a>).</p><p>A gene expression panel that included 16 genes was developed to predict the risk of recurrence in a series of 942 patients who had undergone radical nephrectomy for stage I to III clear cell RCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. This information was used to develop a recurrence score, which was then validated in a series of 626 patients.

Although this recurrence score provides additional information regarding the risk of recurrence, additional research to develop effective adjuvant therapies will be required if this panel is to be used to influence patient management. </p><p>In addition, germline genetic polymorphisms might affect the risk of recurrence in patients with localized RCC.

Patients with favorable (no more than one poor prognostic factor), intermediate (two prognostic factors), or poor-risk (more than two) disease had median survival durations of 26, 14, and 7 months, respectively.
