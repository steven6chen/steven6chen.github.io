However, a few patients have metastatic disease at presentation, and some develop metastases after their initial definitive treatment.</p><p>High-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) was the first treatment to modify the natural history of patients with metastatic melanoma and may have resulted in cure in a small fraction of patients. However, its severe toxicity limited its application to carefully selected patients treated at centers with experience in managing the side effects of treatment. </p><p>More recent research led to the development of immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors (the anti-programmed cell death 1 [PD-1] antibodies [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a>] and the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4] antibody [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>]) and targeted therapy (inhibition of the <em>BRAF</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>MEK</em> genes). Both checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy and targeted therapy prolong progression-free and overall survival compared with chemotherapy, which has not been proven to increase overall survival.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of treatment options for patients with metastatic melanoma, along with their applications in different clinical settings.

However, more information is necessary to determine how the combination compares with a single anti-PD-1 agent followed by ipilimumab or targeted therapy in those with a V600 <em>BRAF</em> mutation when progressive disease occurs. In a randomized trial, the combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab significantly increased the response rate and extent of tumor shrinkage compared with either nivolumab alone or ipilimumab alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In cases where there are isolated sites of progression, a combination of local therapy and continued administration of a BRAF inhibitor may be a reasonable approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

These systemic agents have activity at all sites of disease, including the brain, and the CNS can be considered another site of metastatic disease. The long survival for many patients after receiving immunotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> targeted therapy has led to approaches to minimize the long-term impact of radiation therapy. These systemic therapy approaches need to be integrated into a multidisciplinary management plan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113993\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113993 \">algorithm 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H863137233\"><span class=\"h2\">Locoregional therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In selected situations, locoregional therapy may play an important role in the management of patients with advanced melanoma.

Of the 17 melanoma patients older than 12 years treated with ipilimumab across both studies, two experienced objective responses. Immune-related adverse events included pancreatitis, pneumonitis, endocrinopathies, colitis, and transaminitis, with dose-limiting toxicities observed at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. No grade 2 or higher immune-related toxicities were identified at doses of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> or less. Based upon the results of these studies and evidence from studies in adult patients, in July 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ipilimumab for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in children aged 12 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>There are no results that include significant numbers of pediatric or adolescent patients with advanced melanoma from more recent immunotherapy trials (eg, with single-agent programmed cell death 1 [PD-1] inhibitors or the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>) or with targeted therapies. These agents are likely to be more active than ipilimumab, based upon the adult results. Our approach for pediatric and adolescent patients is to enroll them in formal clinical protocols whenever possible or to pattern therapy after that in adults.

Although widespread metastatic disease develops in most cases, complete resection of metastatic disease is associated with prolonged survival in some cases. Systemic therapy is indicated for patients in whom surgical metastasectomy is not appropriate.

The appropriate choice and sequence of treatments for an individual patient lack supporting prospective data. Currently it is largely empiric and based upon factors such as the extent of disease, the molecular characteristics of the tumor (presence of a driver mutation in <em>BRAF</em> or <em>KIT</em>), and patient performance status and comorbidity. (See <a href=\"#H863137073\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above and <a href=\"#H863137387\" class=\"local\">'Choice and sequence of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinical trials evaluating the optimal sequences for patient subgroups are an important consideration to prospectively address the optimal treatment sequence for subgroups of patients with <em>BRAF</em> mutant melanoma; patients should be enrolled in formal clinical trials whenever possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with advanced cutaneous melanoma should have their tumor assessed for the presence of a V600 <em>BRAF</em> mutation to help guide the choice of systemic therapy.

Additional data are needed to determine which subgroups benefit most from combination versus monotherapies in sequence and what the optimal dose and schedule is for the combination, so clinical trial participation is still encouraged. Targeted therapy is not indicated in patients without a characteristic V600 <em>BRAF </em>mutation.
