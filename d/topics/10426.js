The mercury sphygmomanometer has long been considered the gold standard for measurement of blood pressure, but many different automated devices are also used for this purpose. Blood pressure is obtained after five minutes of rest, with the patient sitting with feet on the ground and legs uncrossed or in a semi-reclining position with her back supported. Whether sitting or in semi-Fowler, the arm should be supported and at heart level. Measurement of blood pressure in left lateral recumbency, on the left arm, does not differ substantially from blood pressure that is recorded in the sitting position, and may be used if a seated blood pressure is not feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].&nbsp;An appropriately sized cuff should be used: width of bladder 40 percent of circumference and encircling 80 percent of the upper arm. A large adult cuff should be used in women with an upper-arm circumference of 35 to 44 cm, and a thigh cuff if the upper-arm circumference is 45 to 52 cm. If an auscultatory method is used, the first audible sound (Korotkoff I) is the systolic pressure and the disappearance of sound (Korotkoff V) is the diastolic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, if sounds are audible with the cuff deflated, which can happen in pregnant women, then Korotkoff IV should be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Caffeine or nicotine within 30 minutes of measurement can increase readings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Various professional societies have published reviews and guidelines addressing the validation of automated devices as well as the proper technique for measurement of blood pressure in nonpregnant subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The British Hypertension Society and the European Society of Hypertension have recommended that blood pressure measuring devices used in pregnant women should be validated in this population because the hemodynamic and vascular changes that occur during pregnancy can affect measurement. However, a meta-analysis of validation studies of devices for blood pressure measurement in pregnancy highlighted the limitations of the available information on this issue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although the majority of devices passed a validation protocol to demonstrate statistical equivalence between the devices and the gold standard mercury sphygmomanometer in pregnant women, only one-third did so without any protocol violations (ie, the specific criteria required for proper performance and statistical reliability).&nbsp;The accuracy of blood pressure measurement in pregnancy is an area that requires further study, both with regard to operator technique and validation of equipment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H2606063649\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Blood pressure measurement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H410894307\"><span class=\"h2\">When to treat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to treat hypertension during pregnancy should consider the risks and benefits for both mother and fetus. The level of blood pressure is the most important factor: Treatment of severe hypertension (defined as systolic BP &ge;160 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic BP &ge;110 mmHg) is always recommended because it is believed to reduce the risk of maternal stroke and other serious maternal complications.</p><p>When deciding whether to treat mild (defined as systolic 140 to 150 mmHg, diastolic 90 to 100 mmHg) to moderate (defined as systolic 150 to 159 mmHg, diastolic 100 to 109 mmHg) hypertension, we take a prudent approach that also considers the patient's comorbidities and symptoms (eg, headaches, visual disturbances), since the benefits and potential risks of treatment are less clear. A major concern has been that aggressive lowering of blood pressure, or even the medications themselves, might inhibit fetal growth and expose the fetus to other potentially harmful effects from these drugs. However, in meta-analyses of randomized trials of treatment versus no treatment of pregnant women with mild to moderate hypertension (chronic or pregnancy related) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] and the 2015 CHIPS trial (Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study) that randomly assigned pregnant women with hypertension to diastolic blood pressure treatment targets of 85 or 100 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], maternal treatment did not increase the risk of delivery of a small for gestational age infant or cause excess fetal risk. These findings were in contrast to a 2002 meta-regression analysis that specifically evaluated the effect of lowering maternal blood pressure on fetal weight and concluded that fetal growth was significantly impaired by the reduction in mean arterial pressure induced by antihypertensive therapy (a 10 mmHg fall in mean arterial pressure was associated with a 176 g decrease in birth weight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Both the meta-analyses and CHIPS trial demonstrated that lower blood pressure was associated with a reduced occurrence of severe maternal hypertension during pregnancy, but did not result in less preeclampsia or maternal stroke; however, all trials have been underpowered to detect differences in stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Prevention of severe hypertension in pregnant women may have maternal and fetal benefits since severe hypertension is a well-established marker for adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>This evidence is described in detail below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2002 meta-regression analysis that specifically evaluated the effect of lowering maternal blood pressure on fetal weight, birth weight was slightly but significantly lowered in association with lowering mean arterial pressure with antihypertensive therapy: A 10 mmHg fall in mean arterial pressure was associated with a 176 g decrease in birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This effect was unrelated to the type of hypertension or choice of medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2014 meta-analysis that evaluated maternal and fetal outcomes in 49 randomized trials of treatment versus no treatment of women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy, treatment did not result in either fetal benefit or harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Mild to moderate hypertension was defined as blood pressures of 140 to <span class=\"nowrap\">159/90</span> to 109 mmHg related to any diagnostic category of pregnancy hypertension. Antihypertensive therapy significantly decreased the incidence of severe hypertension by 40 to 60 percent and the need for additional antihypertensive drugs by 40 to 70 percent but did not increase the frequency of delivery of a small for gestational age infant. It also did not significantly reduce perinatal mortality or frequency of prematurity, preeclampsia, or abruptio placentae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2015 trial (CHIPS, Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study) that randomly assigned pregnant women with gestational or chronic hypertension to diastolic blood pressure treatment targets of 85 or 100 mmHg, there were no differences in maternal, fetal, or neonatal outcomes for the two blood pressure targets, although fewer women in the lower diastolic blood pressure target group developed severe hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The mean difference in blood pressure between groups was 4.6 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure and 5.8 mmHg for systolic blood pressure. Importantly, there were no adverse fetal effects in those randomized to the lower target blood pressure. An important finding of the CHIPS trial was that, in a post hoc analysis, severe maternal hypertension was associated with lower infant birth weight, more preterm delivery, preeclampsia, and features of HELLP syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Women randomized to less tight blood pressure control who developed severe hypertension had a higher rate of serious maternal morbidity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2017 meta-analysis of 15 trials of antihypertensive therapy versus <span class=\"nowrap\">placebo/no</span> treatment of pregnant women with chronic hypertension, antihypertensive therapy reduced the incidence of severe hypertension (relative risk [RR] 0.33, 95% CI 0.19&#8208;0.56), with no difference in birth weight, nor the incidence of superimposed preeclampsia, <span class=\"nowrap\">stillbirth/neonatal</span> death, or small for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53705179\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihypertensive therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016567093\"><span class=\"h3\">Overall safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All antihypertensive drugs cross the placenta. There are no data from large well-designed randomized trials on which to base a strong recommendation for use of one drug over another. Data regarding both comparative efficacy in improving pregnancy outcome and fetal safety are inadequate for almost all antihypertensive drugs. Adding to the confusion in this area are data suggesting that women with chronic hypertension, either treated or untreated, are at increased risk of congenital malformations in offspring, particularly cardiac malformations, compared with normotensive women. Although it is possible that hypertension increases the risk for congenital heart disease (CHD) in offspring and that antihypertensive drugs further increase this risk, it is also possible that hypertension and CHD share similar risk factors.</p><p>A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of <span class=\"nowrap\">newborn/childhood</span> outcomes after in utero exposure to &quot;any&quot; antihypertensive medication was notable in that 47 primary studies were identified, and only 5 studies were considered to be high quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The five studies that were graded as excellent suffered from confounding associated with the selection and nature of the comparison groups and the way in which medication exposure was reported. Only 12 of the 47 studies were randomized trials, and in most the sample size was less than 300. Both the authors of the meta-analysis and the editorial in the same journal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] concluded that although adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes have been reported in women exposed to antihypertensive medications during pregnancy, clear conclusions about the impact of these drugs on pregnancy and the fetus are not possible given the significant methodologic weaknesses and lack of statistical power of available studies. Given the uncertainty in this area, clinicians are advised to use antihypertensive medications when indicated to prevent maternal cardiovascular morbidity and mortality during pregnancy and to choose those with the best safety profile.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3233869094\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk of congenital heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a previous systematic review that evaluated the risk of CHD in offspring of women with hypertension during pregnancy compared with offspring of women without hypertension, the risk of CHD was approximately 80 percent higher in women with hypertension (RR 1.8; 95% CI 1.5-2.2), 100 percent higher in treated hypertensive women (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7), and 40 percent higher in untreated hypertensive women (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The magnitude of effect was generally similar across subtypes of CHD and across the range of antihypertensive therapies; however, the data were insufficient to exclude modest differences. Although a positive association was noted in 14 of 15 studies, these results should be interpreted with caution as neither a dose-response relationship between maternal antihypertensive medication and CHDs nor some potentially important characteristics of the population (eg, severity of hypertension) could be ascertained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53705301\"><span class=\"h3\">Options</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following drugs are effective antihypertensive agents with an acceptable safety profile in pregnancy. The choice of drug depends on the acuity and severity of hypertension and whether or not parenteral or oral therapy is used; these factors are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of hypertension in preeclampsia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management of pregnant women with chronic (preexisting) hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53705507\"><span class=\"h4\">Methyldopa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methyldopa</a> has been widely used in pregnant women and its long-term safety for the fetus has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>], but it is only a mild antihypertensive agent and has a slow onset of action (three to six hours). Many women will not achieve blood pressure goals on this oral agent or are bothered by its sedative effect at high doses.</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyldopa</a> is not widely used outside of pregnancy, it remains useful in this setting, particularly in women who develop adverse effects or are intolerant of other, more widely used medications. Methyldopa has been used for several decades, and its safety has been more extensively documented than other antihypertensive agents. Clinical trials (eg, CHIP) utilized this agent and demonstrated that women treated with methyldopa may have had better outcomes compared to those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>, although these data may be biased by residual confounding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53705068\"><span class=\"h4\">Beta-blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a 2013 systematic review of 13 population-based case-control or cohort studies examining the risk of congenital malformations associated with first trimester oral beta-blocker exposure compared with no exposure, there was no overall increase in major congenital malformations (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.91-1.10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Associations with some organ-specific malformations were observed: cardiovascular defects (OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.18-3.42; 4 studies), cleft <span class=\"nowrap\">lip/palate</span> (OR 3.11; 95% CI 1.79-5.43; 2 studies), and neural tube defects (OR 3.56; 95% CI 1.19-10.67; 2 studies). A 2015 systematic review specifically examining the risk of congenital heart defects associated with treated and untreated hypertension reported an association regardless of treatment status, and an increased risk in women treated with beta-blockers compared with untreated hypertensive women (RR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6-2.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Two subsequent studies have reported conflicting results. Although one found an association between beta-blocker use and congenital heart defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], the other did not after adjusting for maternal age, maternal body mass index, and maternal comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Further research is required given the limitations of these data, including inability to analyze data by type of beta-blocker, variability in timing of exposure within the first trimester, differences in indications for beta-blocker therapy, and recall, recording, publication, and survivor biases. &#160;</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Labetalol</a> has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking activity, and may preserve uteroplacental blood flow to a greater extent than traditional beta-blockers. It has a more rapid onset of action than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methyldopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methyldopa</a> (within two hours versus three to six hours). Randomized trials comparing labetalol to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a> or methyldopa have shown that labetalol is effective and generally safe in pregnancy, although data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Labetalol has been associated with maternal hepatotoxicity, which although rare, is important to recognize as it may be confused with the elevated liver chemistries of the HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver chemistries, and Low Platelet count) syndrome. Most cases are reversible, but fatalities have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A retrospective population-based cohort study observed slightly more adverse outcomes (respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, seizure) among infants exposed in utero to labetalol than those exposed to methyldopa, but only when maternal treatment was for chronic hypertension rather than an acute pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These findings may be related to the duration of therapy in chronic hypertension and differences in baseline characteristics of the mothers in each treatment group (eg, severity of hypertension, control of hypertension), variables not accounted for in the analysis. Labetalol may be administered orally or parenterally. Although less well studied in pregnant women, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pindolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pindolol</a> and the long-acting form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> are acceptable alternative agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The safety of beta-adrenergic blockers is controversial due to inconsistent reports of preterm birth, fetal growth <span class=\"nowrap\">restriction/small</span> for gestational age infant, perinatal mortality, and neonatal apnea, bradycardia, and hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/12,16,25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,25,27</a>] as well as a possible increased risk of congenital malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/14,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18-20</a>]. Furthermore, myometrial relaxation of the gravid uterus is a beta2-receptor-mediated process, and nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>) may counteract the effect of beta2 stimulation. Beta-adrenergic blockers that lack alpha-blocking properties (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>) have been associated with slightly lower placental and fetal weight at delivery when used early in pregnancy, and are generally avoided if an effective drug with a better safety profile is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53705077\"><span class=\"h4\">Calcium channel blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on the safety of calcium channel blockers during pregnancy are mixed.

The risk of these complications subsides in the hours after delivery since preeclampsia resolves after delivery and long-term sequelae are rare. However, delivery may not be beneficial for the fetus if it is born preterm.

The benefit of antihypertensive therapy in pregnant women with mild hypertension is a reduction in risk of developing severe hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], which may not be sufficient to warrant exposing the fetus to the potential adverse effects from these drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] (see <a href=\"#H53704432\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above). Lowering blood pressure does not affect the course of preeclampsia because the primary pathogenetic process is an abnormality of the placental vasculature that results in placental underperfusion, which, in turn, leads to release of factors that cause widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction with multiorgan dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Severe hypertension should be treated to prevent maternal vascular complications (eg, stroke, heart failure). There is no consensus as to the optimal blood pressure threshold for initiating therapy. We initiate antihypertensive therapy in adult women at systolic pressures &ge;150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressures &ge;100 mmHg. We may initiate treatment at even lower levels in women with signs of cardiac decompensation or cerebral symptoms (eg, headache, visual disturbances, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, confusion) and in younger women whose baseline blood pressures were low (less than <span class=\"nowrap\">90/75</span> mmHg), but we acknowledge that this recommendation is not strongly evidence based. There is some evidence that the pathophysiology of the neurologic manifestations of eclampsia is similar to that of the posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

If delivery is likely to be delayed for several days, we believe that blood pressure should be maintained at a level <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150/100</span> mmHg.</p><p>Other clinicians begin antihypertensive treatment when systolic pressure is &ge;160 mmHg or diastolic pressure is &ge;105 to 110 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/1,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,54</a>].

Severe systolic hypertension appears to be more predictive of adverse cerebral events than severe diastolic hypertension. In a retrospective review of over 2200 women with severe intrapartum systolic or diastolic hypertension who delivered in California between 2012 and 2014, women with severe hypertension had significantly higher rates of severe maternal morbidity than those without severe hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. &#160;</p><p>High-quality clinical trials are needed to clarify the parameters for antihypertensive use in women with preeclampsia.

There are no proven benefits to mother or fetus, other than reduction in risk of severe maternal hypertension, and we are concerned about potential adverse fetal effects (see <a href=\"#H53704432\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Indications for antihypertensive therapy'</a> above). Moderate hypertension is treated on a case-by-case basis, such as in women with worrisome cerebrovascular symptoms or evidence of target organ damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend treatment of severe hypertension (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The goal of treatment is to prevent maternal cerebrovascular complications. We initiate antihypertensive therapy in adult women at systolic pressures &ge;150 mmHg and diastolic blood pressures &ge;100 mmHg. We initiate treatment at a lower threshold in younger women whose baseline blood pressure was low, and in those with symptoms that may be attributable to elevated blood pressure (eg, headache, visual disturbances, chest discomfort).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other organizations, such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), have recommended treatment of hypertension when systolic blood pressure is &ge;160 mm Hg.

There are no proven maternal or fetal benefits from therapy of mild hypertension, other than a reduction in risk of developing severe hypertension, and there is some concern about potential adverse effects of treatment on fetal growth.

These thresholds allow non-emergency intervention with oral drugs while hypertension is only moderately elevated. Other clinicians limit antihypertensive drug treatment to pregnant women with severe hypertension (blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;160/110</span> mmHg), since there is consensus that intervention at this level has a proven benefit of protecting the mother from serious complications, such as stroke, heart failure, or renal failure.

This may be due to preeclampsia, intrapartum administration of intravenous fluids, loss of pregnancy associated vasodilation after delivery, mobilization of extracellular fluid after delivery, administration of non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents for postdelivery analgesia, or administration of ergot derivatives to treat postpartum hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H523716270\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment is indicated for persistent hypertension and consideration should be given to initiating therapy well before levels reach the severe range, especially since concerns regarding placental perfusion are no longer relevant. Oral medications similar to those used in the nonpregnant population can be prescribed, with modifications if the woman is breastfeeding.
