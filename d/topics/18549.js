It can cause leg pain, varicose veins, swollen legs, or open sores. Varicose veins are swollen and twisted veins.</p><p>Vein disease happens when the veins in the legs do not work the right way. Normally, the veins in the legs carry blood from the legs back to the heart. The veins have valves inside them to help keep blood moving in only one direction (toward the heart). The valves open to let blood flow to the heart, and close to keep it from flowing back down the leg. Vein disease can happen when the valves are damaged or do not work well. This causes blood to collect in the legs. Blood is especially likely to collect in the legs when a person sits or stands for a long time without walking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1478272784\"><span class=\"h1\">What conditions can cause vein disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vein disease can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood clot in a leg vein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being pregnant, especially more than once &ndash; This causes a change in hormone levels that can weaken vein walls.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight gain</p><p/><p>Vein disease can also run in families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1478272791\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of vein disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with vein disease can have symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg pain, or the leg feeling tired or heavy, especially at the end of the day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen veins &ndash; &quot;Spider veins&quot; are small leg veins that are swollen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F54276\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54276 \">picture 1</a>). &quot;Varicose veins&quot; are larger leg veins that are swollen and twisted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71564\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71564 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the lower legs or ankles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61706\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61706 \">figure 1</a>) &ndash; People can have swelling at the end of the day or all the time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin color changes &ndash; The skin can turn red or red-brown. Skin color changes often happen first around the ankle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open sores, also called &quot;venous ulcers&quot; &ndash; These are usually at the ankle and can be painful and ooze.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1478272798\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for vein disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam to look at your legs. He or she might also do a test called an ultrasound. An ultrasound can check how well the valves in the legs work. It can also see if any of the veins in the legs are blocked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1478272805\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to reduce my symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To reduce swelling, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walk around, and try not to sit or stand in one place for a long time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise your legs up 3 or 4 times a day, for 30 minutes each time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do exercises to point your toes and feet down and up a few times each day</p><p/><p>To treat dry or itchy skin, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your legs each day with a gentle cleanser. Do not use regular soap, which can make skin more dry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use an unscented moisturizing cream or ointment while your skin is still damp. Petroleum jelly works well. Ask your doctor or nurse before using any other type of cream or ointment, because some can cause a rash.</p><p/><p>If your skin problems are severe, your doctor or nurse might suggest special ointment, medicine, or bandages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1478272812\"><span class=\"h1\">How is vein disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can use different treatments to treat symptoms and reduce swelling. These can include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special socks, bandages, or devices:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Compression stockings&quot; are special socks that fit tightly over the ankle and leg. If your doctor or nurse recommends that you wear them, he or she will tell you which type to wear and how to put them on (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53659\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53659 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57705\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57705 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Compression bandages&quot; are layers of bandages that wrap around a person's leg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A &quot;compression pump&quot; is a device that fits around the leg and squeezes the leg every few minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special coverings that are put on an open sore to help it heal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Doctors can use different types of medicines to treat different symptoms. For example, people who cannot use compression stockings or bandages might be able to try medicines that help the veins work better. People with a skin infection might need antibiotics. People with itchy skin might need a prescription cream or ointment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedures &ndash; Doctors can do procedures if other treatments do not work. A doctor can remove or destroy damaged veins so they can no longer fill with blood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1478272819\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=swelling-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Swelling (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-blood-clots-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doppler-ultrasound-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Doppler ultrasound (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vein-ablation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vein ablation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=superficial-vein-phlebitis-and-thrombosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Superficial vein phlebitis and thrombosis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-venous-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic venous disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
