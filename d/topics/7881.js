This sometimes makes the muscle tear. Another term for a groin strain is a &quot;pulled groin.&quot;</p><p>A groin strain can happen while exercising, such as from suddenly changing direction, or during an accident. The muscles involved in a groin strain are called the adductor muscles. The adductor muscles connect the pelvis to the thigh bone, and pull the legs toward each other.</p><p>A groin strain is the most common cause of groin pain, especially in active adults. It can be mild or severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145739000\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a groin strain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people feel a pull in their groin when the strain happens. Other symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle spasm or tightness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leg weakness, or having trouble walking or moving the legs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145739015\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have a groin strain by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>But some people do need tests. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor or nurse might order an imaging test such as an ultrasound or MRI scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145739030\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a groin strain treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A groin strain usually gets better on its own, but it can take weeks to heal completely.</p><p>To help with your symptoms, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest your groin muscles and avoid movements or activities that cause pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice the area &ndash; You can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the painful area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. Use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after the injury. Some people find it helpful to ice up to 2 days after an injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wrap your upper thigh with an elastic bandage or other type of wrap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83481\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83481 \">picture 1</a>), or wear compression shorts &ndash; These things can help support your muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raise the muscle above the level of your heart (if possible) &ndash; For example, if you lie down, you can put a pillow under your groin or thigh. This is helpful only for the first few days after an injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicine to reduce the pain and swelling &ndash; If you have a lot of pain or a severe groin strain, your doctor will prescribe a strong pain medicine. If your strain is not severe, you can take an over-the-counter medicine such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p>After your pain gets better, your doctor or nurse will recommend that you gently stretch and exercise your groin muscles. Stretches and exercises can help strengthen your muscles and keep them from getting too stiff.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will show you which stretches and exercises to do. Or he or she will have you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert).</p><p>It's important to let your groin muscle heal before you play sports or do other activities that use the muscle again. If you don't let your muscle heal, you are likely to injure it again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145739045\"><span class=\"h1\">Can a groin strain be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can help prevent a groin strain by warming up your muscles before you exercise. You can do this by walking or doing another light activity. You can also prevent injuries by doing exercises to strengthen the muscles in your legs and in the center of your body, and make these muscles more flexible.</p><p>If you are not sure how to do these things, a physical therapist or other exercise professional can help you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145739060\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=muscle-strain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Muscle strain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
