The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies malnutrition based upon the degree of wasting or stunting and the presence of edema, as described in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries: Clinical assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation and management of the malnutrition depends on the clinical setting and cause of malnutrition. Although the principles of assessment and management of malnourished children from resource-rich countries are similar to those from resource-limited countries, the specific details may vary based on local customs and resources. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-and-radiologic-evaluation-of-nutritional-status-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory and radiologic evaluation of nutritional status in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-undernutrition-in-children-younger-than-two-years-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive (undernutrition) in children younger than two years: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The micronutrient deficiencies that are most commonly associated with protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) in children are discussed here. Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, iron, and zinc are particularly common, but deficiencies of other water-soluble vitamins, minerals, and trace elements also may be found, varying with the region and chronicity of the malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/micronutrient-deficiencies-associated-with-malnutrition-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. More detailed information about the biochemistry of these micronutrients and their deficiency states is discussed in separate topic reviews. The clinical assessment and treatment of these children, including definitions and anthropometric measurements is discussed separately.

Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, iron, and zinc are particularly common, but deficiencies of other water-soluble vitamins, minerals, and trace elements also may be found, varying with the region and chronicity of the malnutrition. In most cases, specific testing is not necessary because empiric replacement of vitamins and minerals is routinely included in nutritional rehabilitation. For some deficiencies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Vitamin A</a>), additional replacement doses are given to patients who are symptomatic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63827 \">table 1</a>).

In this setting, concerns for specific deficiencies are guided by knowledge about the patient's specific risk factors, such as bowel anatomy or diet, as well as by clinical symptoms. For symptomatic patients, laboratory testing is appropriate to confirm the diagnosis before embarking on replacement, since multiple deficiencies may be present, and signs and symptoms often overlap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78426 \">table 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As examples, assessment of fat-soluble vitamin levels may be warranted for patients with malabsorptive disorders. Evaluation of folate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin B12</a>, and zinc may be warranted in inflammatory bowel disease.

EFA levels may be altered by diet, disease, or prematurity. EFA deficiency can be diagnosed by measuring the triene:tetraene ratio in blood; a ratio &gt;0.2 suggests EFA deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/micronutrient-deficiencies-associated-with-malnutrition-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This biochemical sign will be evident prior to any physical changes. Physical signs include scaly dermatitis, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia.

The severity of the malnutrition can be categorized based upon the degree of wasting or stunting and the presence of edema.

Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, iron, and zinc are particularly common, but deficiencies of other water-soluble vitamins, minerals, and trace elements also may be found, varying with the region and chronicity of the malnutrition. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Mineral and trace element deficiencies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Water soluble vitamin deficiencies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether specific laboratory testing for these nutritional deficiencies is valuable depends on the clinical setting and cause of malnutrition. In resource-limited countries, an empiric approach to replacement often is most practicable. Children with severe malnutrition are routinely given a cocktail of vitamin and mineral supplements as part of the standard therapeutic feeding regimen. Iron supplements are added during the rehabilitation phase.
