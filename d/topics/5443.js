On the basis of a specified number of descriptive <span class=\"nowrap\">yes/no</span> criteria from a larger set, patients are diagnosed as having or not having one or more of ten personality disorders. </p><p>Many problems with this approach have been recognized. Pathological personality traits and functioning manifest in individual patients along a continuum of severity that the present diagnoses fail to capture. An exclusively categorical approach can lead to multiple personality disorder diagnoses being needed to describe a patient&rsquo;s personality pathology and arbitrary distinctions between patients whose conditions meet criteria for a disorder and those who fall just short of meeting criteria. Patients with very different personality characteristics can be grouped within the same diagnostic category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dimensional-categorical-approach-to-assessing-personality-disorder-pathology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>DSM-5, in a section on &ldquo;Emerging Measures and Models,&rdquo; also includes an alternative model of personality disorders that takes a hybrid, dimensional-categorical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dimensional-categorical-approach-to-assessing-personality-disorder-pathology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and addresses many of these problems. </p><p>The alternative DSM-5 model for personality disorders is reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis and treatment of several DSM-5 personality disorders (borderline, antisocial, narcissistic, and schizotypal) are reviewed separately.

Each trait domain consists of from three to eight more specific personality trait &ldquo;facets&rdquo; (eg, emotional lability in the negative affectivity domain; impulsivity in the disinhibition domain). </p><p>Traits can be rated on a four-point dimensional scale of descriptiveness (0 = not at all descriptive, 1 = mildly descriptive, 2 = moderately descriptive; and 3 = very descriptive). A trait judged by a clinician to be moderately or very descriptive of a person &ldquo;counts&rdquo; as present.

The severity<em> </em>of impairment in self and interpersonal functioning also has predicted important factors such as treatment utilization and treatment course and outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dimensional-categorical-approach-to-assessing-personality-disorder-pathology/abstract/40,46-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,46-52</a>]; thus, personality functioning is measured on a dimensional scale of severity in the alternative model.</p><p>In addition to the independent utility of personality functioning constructs and of pathological personality traits, a number<strong> </strong>of more recent studies support a model of personality psychopathology that specifically combines<strong> </strong>ratings of disorder and trait constructs (ie, a hybrid model). Each approach has been shown to add incremental value to the other in predicting important antecedent (eg, family history, history of child abuse), concurrent (eg, functional impairment, medication use), and predictive (eg, future functioning, hospitalization, suicide attempts) variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dimensional-categorical-approach-to-assessing-personality-disorder-pathology/abstract/8,9,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,53,54</a>].</p><p>A survey of clinicians&rsquo; assessments of their patients examined the relationships between DSM-IV standard personality disorder diagnoses and DSM-5 alternative model personality disorders and their components to clinical judgments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dimensional-categorical-approach-to-assessing-personality-disorder-pathology/abstract/20,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,30</a>] concerning:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current psychosocial functioning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk for self-harm, violence, and criminality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimal level of treatment intensity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosis</p><p/><p>Alternative-model components together and individually (personality functioning level and traits) had appreciably stronger correlations with these judgments than standard personality disorder categories in 11 of 12 comparisons. The only exception was for the prediction of perceived risk, which was more associated standard personality disorders than with alternative-model level of personality functioning ratings (however, alternative-model traits in isolation and alternative-model LPFS ratings and traits combined were superior to standard categories in predicting perceived risk).</p><p>Virtually all valid variance in standard personality disorder diagnoses was captured by the alternative-model, but the converse was not true. Incremental validity of the standard and alternative personality disorder systems was examined as the associations between each of the two personality disorder systems and the four clinical judgments above, while controlling for the effects of the other. The partial multiple (and corrected) correlations showed that alternative personality disorder renderings improved upon standard personality disorders in predicting all four clinical judgments, while standard did not provide any information above and beyond that provided by the alternative model. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2280139463\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL &ldquo;BURDEN&rdquo;</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The DSM-5 alternative model dimensional-categorical approach to assessing personality pathology is not only a more valid and clinically useful approach, but is also less burdensome to clinicians than the standard categorical approach. In making a rating on the Level of Personality Functioning Scale (LPFS), a clinician &ldquo;selects the level that most closely captures the individual&rsquo;s current overall level of impairment in personality functioning&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dimensional-categorical-approach-to-assessing-personality-disorder-pathology/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>] on a five-point scale of severity. </p><p>Ratings of the 25 pathological personality traits describe the myriad ways in which personality disorders present and the same ratings can be used to make categorical diagnoses of six specific personality disorders and the diagnosis of personality disorder-trait specified for all other presentations. These 26 components compare with 79 adult criteria and 15 adolescent criteria (for conduct disorder preceding antisocial personality disorder) or a total of 94 criteria in order to fully assess the 10 standard personality disorders. </p><p>Despite or because of this burden, research has shown that clinicians have most often used the diagnosis of personality disorder not otherwise specified (PDNOS) when diagnosing their patients with personality pathology, rather than one or more of the standard personality disorder diagnoses. PDNOS conveys little clinical information about a patient other than he or she is thought to have a personality disorder. The counterpart residual diagnosis in the alternative model, personality disorder-trait specified, includes both the severity of impairment in personality functioning (moderate, severe, or extreme) and the specific traits rated as descriptive of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2576538503\"><span class=\"h1\">ICD-11</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Classification of Diseases &ndash; 11<sup>th</sup> revision proposes a virtually completely dimensional approach to personality disorder classification with a single category of personality disorder measured as mild, moderate, and severe with five descriptive trait domains &ndash; negative affectivity, detachment, dissocial, disinhibition, and anankastic &ndash; the first four of which are very similar to the trait domains of the DSM-5 alternative model, but no specific personality disorder types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dimensional-categorical-approach-to-assessing-personality-disorder-pathology/abstract/28,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,56</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3009930950\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The categorical approach to the assessment and diagnosis of personality disorders (the standard approach in DSM-IV and DSM-5) has many limitations (see <a href=\"#H2321837069\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of categorical approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extensive co-occurrence &ndash; Most patients receiving the diagnosis meet criteria for more than one </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A high degree of heterogeneity among patients with the same personality disorder diagnosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Temporal instability of personality disorder diagnoses </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arbitrary diagnostic thresholds in polythetic criteria </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Poor coverage of personality pathology </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The alternative DSM-5 model for personality disorders, which uses a dimensional-categorical approach, enables clinicians to identify personality psychopathology, quantify its severity, and characterize its myriad clinical manifestations in terms of impairments in personality functioning and pathological personality traits.
