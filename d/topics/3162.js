However, there is considerable overlap between the clinical features as patients with CML, for example, often have thrombocytosis. </p><p>CML is almost invariably associated an abnormal chromosome 22 known as the Philadelphia chromosome, often abbreviated as Ph, Ph(1), or Ph<sup>1</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)(q34;q11) results in the formation of a unique gene product (BCR-ABL1), which is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. This deregulated tyrosine kinase is implicated in the development of CML and has become a primary target for the treatment of this disorder.</p><p>The cellular and molecular biology of CML will be reviewed here.

The derivation of this clonal population from a multipotent HSC was first supported by cytogenetic studies that demonstrated the Ph chromosome in granulocyte, monocyte, and erythroid precursors, megakaryocytes, and most B-lymphocytes from patients with CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Subsequent findings supported the role of a multipotent HSC as the cell of origin:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>BCR-ABL1</em> mRNA can be found in CD34+ (progenitor) subpopulations from patients with CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukemia stem cells in mice are Lin-c-Kit+Sca-1+, a known phenotype of HSCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-third of CD3+ T lymphocytes are Ph-positive in chronic phase CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When CML progresses to acute phase, the blast cells may be of myeloid or lymphoid phenotype and are invariably found to carry the Ph chromosome, suggesting that they arise from the same leukemic clone as the chronic phase cells.

By contrast, CML in blast crisis appears to be derived from various BCR-ABL1 transformed progenitor cell populations, rather than a more primitive HSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

These leukemic stem cells (LSC, also leukemia-initiating cells) may be more immature than the majority of circulating leukemic cells, and are thought to have originated from cells with existing self-renewal capacity or from progenitors that have re-acquired this stem cell-like property [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The size of this HSC compartment, as defined by cell surface antigen expression, is normal, while committed myeloid progenitors and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) are significantly increased in number [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Studies in mouse model systems demonstrate that BCR-ABL1 does not confer self-renewal capacity to committed myeloid progenitors, and sustained CML-like leukemia cannot be produced by transplantation of BCR-ABL1-expressing committed progenitors into recipient mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This helps to explain why the Ph chromosome translocation is present in a multipotential HSC even though CML predominantly affects the neutrophil lineage: stem cell origin is required for maintenance of the disease in the bone marrow. </p><p>Interestingly, even though the BCR-ABL1 kinase is active in CML LSCs, CML LSCs exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors are not dependent upon BCR-ABL1 kinase activity for survival, but instead revert to dependence on cytokines that normally mediate survival and proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. As such, efforts are ongoing to identify survival pathways in LSCs that may be targeted. As an example, initial studies in mice suggest that the B-lymphoid kinase (Blk) gene acts as a tumor suppressor in CML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In these models, BCR-ABL1 acts through the transcriptional regulator c-Myc to downregulate the <em>Blk</em> gene in LSCs. The restoration of <em>Blk</em> expression or the expression of other genes in the Blk pathway suppresses LSCs without impairing normal hematopoietic stem cells or hematopoiesis.</p><p>Several research groups have used mathematical modeling in an attempt to predict disease progression and control. As yet, the clinical utility of these measures is unknown. Studies of <em>BCR-ABL1</em> transcript dynamics in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> have revealed an initial rapid decline in the majority of patients, followed by a slower rate of decrease. Mathematical models suggest that the first phase represents elimination of mature cells and committed progenitors, while the slower decline may reflect a gradual decrease in the LSC population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Although patients who experience a more rapid decrease in the putative LSC population have superior overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], further prospective studies are necessary to determine if this parameter can be used to identify patients who might safely discontinue TKI therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">THE BCR-ABL1 FUSION PROTEIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The protein product of the Philadelphia chromosome, the BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, is unique to the leukemic cells and is the fundamental cause of all the abnormalities observed in the Ph-positive leukemias.

This transition from chronic phase to accelerated phase is often subtle and may not be easily detected. In virtually all patients treated with palliative chemotherapeutic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a>) and in some patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the disease culminates in an acute leukemia, termed &quot;blast crisis.&quot; This phase, which is generally refractory to treatment, occurs approximately three to five years after the diagnosis of CML and 18 months after the onset of the accelerated phase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Disease phase'</a>.)</p><p>The progression of CML from chronic phase to accelerated phase or blast crisis is a complex, multistep process that is only partially understood.

A direct comparison of the leukemogenic properties of the p190, p210, and p230 BCR-ABL1 oncogenes in this model system indicates that all three forms of BCR-ABL1 induce a similar CML-like disease with equal efficiency, but that p190 is more potent than either p210 or p230 for lymphoid leukemogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

However, induction of B-lymphoid leukemia by BCR-ABL1 is attenuated by the lack of these three Src kinases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/220\" class=\"abstract_t\">220</a>]. These results suggest that Src family kinases may be rational therapeutic targets in Ph+ B-ALL and CML lymphoid blast crisis, but not in chronic phase CML.

Comparison of the leukemogenic properties of the p190 and p210 forms of BCR-ABL1 in transgenic mice indicate that p210 mice develop B- and T-lymphoid leukemia of relatively long latency, while p190 mice develop exclusively B-lymphoid malignancy of shorter latency, supporting a distinct difference in lymphoid leukemogenesis by the two isoforms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellular-and-molecular-biology-of-chronic-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/228\" class=\"abstract_t\">228</a>].</p><p>Conditional transgenic models of BCR-ABL1 have been developed that allow control of oncogene expression.
