In adolescent and adult life, the abdomen often assumes a smooth &quot;pot belly&quot; configuration. Contrary to this definition, PBS is in fact a multisystem disease, with patients displaying concomitant cardiopulmonary, gastrointestinal, and musculoskeletal anomalies in varying degree.</p><p>PBS, including its pathology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prognosis will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon data from the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID) from 2002, 2003, and 2006, the incidence of PBS in the United States was approximately 3.8 cases per 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this report, approximately 50 percent of affected patients were white, 30 percent black, and 10 percent Hispanic. PBS primarily occurs in males, although there are rare case reports of this disorder in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic basis of PBS remains unknown. A recessive X-linked defect is suggested by the predominance of affected males. However, this mode of inheritance is precluded by two observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although rare, the disorder can occur in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affected men suffer from azoospermia</p><p/><p>PBS has also occurred in association with other chromosomal abnormalities, including trisomy 13, 18, and 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and a report of large deletion in the long arm of chromosome 6 in a male fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Further evidence for a genetic basis of PBS includes a report of two cases of concordant PBS in monozygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and a report of two non-twin brothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Isolated abdominal wall muscular hypoplasia, without evidence of urinary tract or renal pathology, has also been described in a family with apparent autosomal dominant or mitochondrial inheritance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mesenchymal developmental defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been suggested that the underlying defect in PBS is abnormal mesoderm development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In particular, a primary defect in the intermediate and lateral plate mesoderm would affect embryogenesis of the musculature of the abdominal wall, the mesonephric and paramesonephric ducts, and the urinary organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The underlying mesenchymal defect may be caused by a deletion of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta (<em>HFN1B</em>) gene on chromosome 17q12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. HFN1B is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression and plays a crucial role in embryonic development, as it is essential for visceral endoderm specification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. HFN1B is expressed in the epithelial cells of the kidney, pancreas, liver, genital tract, and intestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Mutations in the <em>HFNIB</em> gene may lead to abnormal development of the kidneys and genital tract; however, it does not explain all the findings of PBS, such as the lack of abdominal musculature. However, in a study of 32 patients with PBS (30 males and 2 females), only one missense mutation, which was functionally normal, was detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In a case report, six brothers of a Turkish family with a prune-belly-like syndrome had inherited the same loss-of-function mutation of the <em>CHRM3</em> gene from their unaffected parents. <em>CHRM3</em> gene encodes the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3 that, apart from its role in detrusor contractions, is present in developing renal epithelia and bladder muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, some investigators have suggested that early urethral obstruction by a valve-like mechanism is the primary abnormality in PBS, which can then lead to the other clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, the observation that patients with congenital posterior urethral valves (PUV) do not have the other features of PBS casts doubt on this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathologic involvement of the kidneys, genitourinary tract, and other organ systems results in the variable clinical manifestations of PBS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidneys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major renal change in PBS is dysplasia that affects a variable portion of renal tissue. The dysplasia is manifested by incomplete nephron differentiation and dilatation of tubules, which are lined by immature epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Tubular atrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and chronic lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates are present, and glomerulosclerosis is eventually seen. In addition, associated findings include reflux nephropathy and recurrent pyelonephritis, which may result in cortical scars.</p><p>Renal dysplastic changes may not be evident before 16 weeks gestation as demonstrated by a case report from Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this report, a fetus was diagnosed with PBS by ultrasound at 12 weeks gestation with cystomegaly due to urethral obstruction. The pregnancy was terminated at 14 weeks gestation based upon fetal urinary electrolyte and beta-2-microglobulin values that indicated a poor renal prognosis. An autopsy demonstrated abdominal wall defects and severe urethral obstruction consistent with a diagnosis of PBS, but the kidneys were histologically normal without any evidence of dysplasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Genitourinary tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities of the ureter, prostate, bladder, and testicles are commonly observed. These anomalies may be unilateral or bilateral, thereby resulting in varying degrees of renal insufficiency due to vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and obstruction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureters &ndash; The ureters are grossly elongated, dilated, and tortuous due to replacement of smooth muscle with fibrous tissue. Ureteral stenoses may occur due to kinking. Peristalsis is ineffective or lacking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder &ndash; The bladder is usually enlarged and nontrabeculated, and has thickened walls (due to collagen deposits) with smooth muscle hypoplasia. The dome of the bladder is frequently capped by a diverticular remnant of the urachus. The trigone is barely discernible, and the ureteral ostia are lateralized (often with a golf-hole-like appearance).</p><p/><p>Contrary to a widely held belief that urinary obstruction is the cause of bladder distention, intraluminal storage and voiding pressures are abnormally low in patients with PBS. Significant residual urine volumes suggest the presence of defective bladder urodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostate &ndash; A hallmark of PBS in males is a markedly hypoplastic or dysplastic prostate, which leads to dilatation of the prostatic urethra. In occasional patients, a valve-like mechanism develops in the membranous part of the urethra and causes urinary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This may lead to a pressure-induced dysplasia of the prostate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testicles &ndash; Bilateral undescended testes and an empty scrotum are regularly found in affected male patients. However, spermatogonia are not universally absent. The germ cells are markedly reduced in number, appear atypical, and may predispose to malignant tumors later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal wall and gastrointestinal tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A constant feature of PBS is partial aplasia or hypoplasia of the abdominal muscles (which may be unilateral or asymmetric), leading to the prune-belly appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68993\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68993 \">picture 1</a>). Electron microscopy of affected abdominal muscles reveals dystrophy with loss of coherence in the Z bands, clumping of glycogen granules, and mitochondrial abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Gastrointestinal malformations can occur and include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malrotation of the midgut and persistence of the embryonic wide mesentery, resulting in coecum mobile, elongation of the colon, and volvulus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-malrotation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal malrotation in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hindgut abnormalities, leading to anorectal malformations (eg, persistence of the embryonic cloaca, agenesis of rectum and anus, and congenital pouch colon).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Skeleton</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skeletal abnormalities are numerous and include clubfoot, dislocated hip, kyphoscoliosis, polydactyly, torticollis, and pectus excavatum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Some of these abnormalities are deformations due to severe reduction of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-positional-deformations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity positional deformations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lung hypoplasia leading to respiratory insufficiency is frequently responsible for early mortality among patients with PBS. In the first half of gestation, oligohydramnios due to lack of sufficient urine production promotes mechanical compression of the fetus and inhibits thoracic expansion. Without amniotic fluid entering the airways, the lungs remain hypoplastic. In addition, thoracic cage deformities and paradoxical movement of the abdomen during respiration may predispose affected patients to mechanical restriction, thereby explaining their susceptibility to recurrent bronchitis and respiratory depression following anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>In addition, cases of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations in patients with PBS have been reported, suggesting a possible association between these two disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital pulmonary airway (cystic adenomatoid) malformation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, complex cardiac anomalies can occur in association with PBS. In a single case report, isolated dextrocardia, single ventricle, pulmonary atresia, incomplete atrioventricular septal defect, hemiazygos continuity, persistent right superior vena cava (SVC), and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were described in an 11-month-old male infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of renal dysplasia and urinary tract abnormalities, and the presence of pulmonary hypoplasia are the two principal characteristics that determine the clinical manifestations and eventual outcome among patients with PBS. These abnormalities may result in recurrent episodes of urinary tract infections (UTI), urosepsis, varying degrees of renal and respiratory insufficiency, and other manifestations of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one-half of the patients surviving infancy will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) in childhood or adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Findings of bilaterally abnormal kidneys (as determined by ultrasound or renal scan), a serum creatinine concentration greater than 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (62 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcmol/L),</span> and episodes of clinical pyelonephritis appear to predict the eventual development of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Other patients with the least severe form of the syndrome experience either no or only mild impairment of renal function.</p><p>The severity and timing of onset of renal insufficiency may reflect the degree of renal dysplasia. One study, for example, correlated histologic findings with the severity and onset of renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. At autopsy, six of nine children who had died in infancy or as neonates had severe and diffuse renal dysplasia. By comparison, dysplastic changes were observed in less than 25 percent of the renal parenchyma in 10 surviving patients, all of whom had varying degrees of renal insufficiency. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) in these patients was thought to be due to pyelonephritis and obstruction, not renal dysplasia.</p><p>There may be a striking discrepancy between the deformed appearance of the urinary tract on renal ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG), and the often surprisingly good renal function. These radiologic techniques are, therefore, not always reliable in assessing obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H208159182\"><span class=\"h3\">End-stage renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are limited regarding end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with PBS. Review of data from Society for Pediatric <span class=\"nowrap\">Nephrology/European</span> Renal Association-European Dialysis and Transplant Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ESPN/ERA-EDTA)</span> Registry identified a cohort of 88 children with PBS who progressed to ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Age at renal replacement therapy (RRT) onset varied, with 15, 25, 22, and 26 patients starting RRT at &lt;0.5 years, 0.5 to 5 years, 6 to 10 years, and &ge;11 years, respectively. Initial RRT included peritoneal dialysis (n = 44), preemptive renal transplantation (n = 29), and hemodialysis (n = 15).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Urogenital</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients have urologic abnormalities. This was illustrated in a review of 46 patients (44 boys and 2 girls) cared for at a tertiary center in the United States, which reported bilateral hydroureteronephrosis in 45 patients (98 percent) and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in 34 cases (78 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, although affected male patients usually experience normal erections and orgasm, retrograde ejaculation is frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Owing to early orchiopexy, there are case reports of successful paternity by aspirated sperm retrieval and in vitro fertilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>UTIs, including recurrent episodes of UTIs and pyelonephritis, are also common, occasionally resulting in urosepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary and chest abnormalities may result in respiratory insufficiency, impaired cough mechanism, recurrent bronchitis, and respiratory depression following anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Other findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other findings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic constipation, is a common feature of PBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/31,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,37</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired exercise tolerance in older children and adults due to paradoxical motion of the abdomen during respiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth retardation occurs in up to one-third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorectal malformations have been described in children with PBS including imperforate anus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], anorectal agenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], or congenital pouch colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenic torsion may occur due to intestinal malrotation and wandering spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal and cardiac anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/27,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30,31</a>] (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Skeleton'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Heart'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of PBS is made clinically with the identification of the characteristic features of abdominal muscle deficiency, severe urinary tract abnormalities, and bilateral cryptorchidism in males. The syndrome is most often recognized at birth or in early childhood by the peculiar appearance of the abdominal wall, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI), and varying degrees of renal insufficiency.

Furthermore, as the progression of the renal insufficiency in childhood and adolescence is primarily due to recurrent pyelonephritis and reflux nephropathy, adequate antibiotic therapy including antibiotic prophylaxis and, in rare cases, surgical intervention may prevent or delay end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prune-belly-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Boys are primarily affected, although there are rare cases in females. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of PBS remains unknown. It is thought to be due to a mesenchymal genetic defect. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of renal pathology is the primary factor that affects the clinical manifestations of PBS. Dysplasia is the main renal abnormality of PBS, and it is manifested by incomplete nephron differentiation and dilatation of the tubules. Approximately one-half of patients have severe dysplasia and develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and require renal replacement therapy (RRT). In addition, insufficient fetal urine production leading to oligohydramnios results in pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal mortality among patients with severe PBS. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Kidneys'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Renal'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Lung'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other clinical findings include genitourinary abnormalities including cryptorchidism in males, and aplasia or hypoplasia of the abdominal muscles. Less commonly, gastrointestinal malformations (eg, malrotation of the midgut or anorectal malformations), skeletal abnormalities (eg, clubfoot), and rarely cardiac anomalies are observed. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PBS may be made by antenatal ultrasonographic examination between weeks 20 and 30, or at birth or in early childhood by clinical recognition of the syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of PBS is dependent upon the severity of the clinical findings:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In rare cases, antenatal intervention has been performed to reduce the risk and severity of pulmonary hypoplasia. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Antenatal management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Postnatal surgical intervention may be needed to provide adequate urinary drainage and avoid urinary tract infections in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Postnatal management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>RRT for those patients with ESRD includes dialysis and renal transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'End-stage renal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other interventions include additional genitourinary procedures to improve bladder control and capacity, orchiopexy, abdominal wall reconstruction, and, in rare cases, orthopedic surgery for skeletal deformities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the survival rate has improved for PBS with earlier diagnosis and intervention, the mortality rate still remains at approximately 30 percent, with the majority of deaths occurring in the perinatal period.
