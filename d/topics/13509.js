It has been used as an immunosuppressive agent for the treatment of a variety of disorders, including a number of rheumatic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis and polymyositis, systemic sclerosis, and systemic vasculitis; for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions; and for the prevention of organ transplant rejection.</p><p>The pharmacology and adverse effects of AZA, particularly when used in the context of the rheumatic diseases, will be reviewed here. The role of AZA in the management of the different rheumatic diseases and other autoimmune and immune-mediated disorders, and for the prevention and management of transplant rejection, is presented in detail separately in the appropriate topic reviews covering the treatment of these individual conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a> (AZA) is the 1-methyl-4-nitro-5-imidazolyl derivative of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thioguanine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thioguanine</a>, a purine-mimic antimetabolite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has a serum half-life of 0.2 to 0.5 hours, resulting in a biologic half-life of approximately 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. AZA is a prodrug; the action of glutathione in red blood cells causes the formation of the principal metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prodrug AZA is approximately 30 percent protein-bound. Forty-five percent of the drug is excreted in the urine; the remainder is metabolized to 6-MP, which is then further metabolized along competing routes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It undergoes catabolic oxidation to 6-thiouric acid, which is an inactive metabolite. This reaction is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, which is concentrated in the intestine and liver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is also metabolized along an anabolic pathway to several metabolites including 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP), 6-methyl-thioinosine 5'-monophosphate, and 6-thioguanine (6-TG). Two enzymes are responsible for catalyzing these reactions: thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase.</p><p/><p>The relative accumulation of these metabolites depends upon genetic polymorphisms of the individual enzymes. The toxicity of AZA and 6-MP is predominantly related the activity of TPMT. In particular, deficiency of this enzyme causes 6-MP to be preferentially metabolized toward 6-TG nucleotides, which appear to account for much of the hematologic toxicity related to AZA and 6-MP. An inactive metabolite, 6-MMP, is associated with hepatotoxicity. Low TPMT activity has been observed in up to 11 percent of the population, with 0.3 percent having negligible activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pharmacogenomics#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pharmacogenomics&quot;, section on 'Thiopurine methyltransferase'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacogenetics and TPMT testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is uncertainty regarding the benefits of routine testing for TPMT deficiency (MIM #187680) before beginning AZA; both genotyping and functional assays for this enzyme are available commercially. Although some clinicians routinely perform TPMT testing prior to initiating AZA, the author does not perform such testing but rather initiates therapy at a low dose with close monitoring as the dose is gradually increased. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Dosing and monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>TPMT is responsible for the metabolism of thiopurines, including AZA and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mercaptopurine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mercaptopurine</a>. Variation in the <em>TPMT</em> gene can result in functional inactivation of the enzyme and in a markedly increased risk of life-threatening myelosuppression. For this reason, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that &quot;consideration be given to either genotype or phenotype patients for TPMT&quot; prior to treatment with AZA. However, TPMT genotyping has not been universally adopted, and the cost effectiveness and optimal clinical circumstances in which to perform routine testing are not well-defined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pharmacogenomics#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pharmacogenomics&quot;, section on 'Thiopurine methyltransferase'</a>.)</p><p>Expert opinions differ regarding the role of <em>TPMT</em> genotyping prior to the administration of thiopurines for treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. Some advocate routine testing, while others, citing the low frequency of homozygous variants among Caucasians and the fact that the majority of patients who develop myelosuppression while taking AZA do not have detectable <em>TPMT</em> gene mutations, disagree with this approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pharmacogenomics#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pharmacogenomics&quot;, section on 'Thiopurine methyltransferase'</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above.)</p><p>Examples of the clinical observations regarding such testing include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study among 67 patients given AZA, five of six individuals heterozygous for a mutant allele (as assessed by polymerase chain reaction-based assays) discontinued therapy within one month of drug initiation because of low leukocyte counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. AZA was given for a significantly longer period to those with wild-type alleles compared with patients with gene mutations (39 versus 2 weeks, respectively). By contrast, there was no association between <em>TPMT</em> alleles and AZA toxicity in a study of 342 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Korea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar considerations to those with AZA apply to the use of 6-MP. In a series of 180 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the cumulative incidence of dose reductions in 6-MP due to drug toxicity was 7 percent in the 161 children with two wild-type <em>TPMT</em> alleles, 35 percent in the 17 children with one mutant allele, and 100 percent in the two children with two mutant alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Lowering the 6-MP dose in the last two groups permitted administration of the full protocol.</p><p/><p>Target serum levels of the metabolite 6-TG can also be used to help predict efficacy and toxicity. In an open-label study of AZA therapy for 50 patients with active SLE, pretreatment TPMT status facilitated dosing of AZA necessary to achieve appropriate serum levels of 6-TG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Other genes are also likely to play a role in determining AZA toxicity. As an example, polymorphisms of glutathione-S-transferase have also been associated with AZA-related adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6102133\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug interactions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2696869897\"><span class=\"h3\">Xanthine oxidase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major drug interactions with AZA are with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">febuxostat</a>, which slow the elimination of 6-MP by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, the mechanism by which allopurinol and febuxostat reduce uric acid levels in patients with hyperuricemia and gout, consequently increasing the risk of adverse effects from use of AZA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Thus, the dose of AZA should be reduced significantly (by 50 to 75 percent) in patients who require treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>, but this combination should be avoided if possible. In patients receiving both agents, the white blood cell count should be carefully monitored. When AZA is combined with either xanthine oxidase inhibitor (even with appropriate dose reduction), a complete blood count (CBC) should be performed at two weeks and monthly for three months, and this testing regimen should be repeated any time the dose is increased. TPMT testing is recommended for patients receiving a combination of AZA with allopurinol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">febuxostat</a>, and an alternative agent should be considered in the setting of heterozygous or homozygous deficiency.</p><p>There is insufficient experience combining AZA and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">febuxostat</a> to make specific dosing reduction recommendations; this combination should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

These compounds suppress intracellular inosinic acid synthesis, thereby interfering with adenine and guanine ribonucleotide production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. This reduction in intracellular purine synthesis results in decreased numbers of circulating B and T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], reduced immunoglobulin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and diminished interleukin (IL)-2 secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a> (AZA) does not reduce serum levels of IL-6 or soluble IL-2 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Another pathway that is inhibited by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thioguanine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thioguanine</a> is the intracellular signaling downstream of the necessary costimulatory binding by CD28 on the surface of CD4+ T cells to B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;, section on 'CD28, B7, and CTLA4'</a>). Specifically, the metabolite 6-thioguanine triphosphate (6-thio-GTP) diminishes the activity of the small GTPase Rac1 in T lymphocytes. 6-thio-GTP blocks the interaction between Rac1 and its guanosine exchange factor Vav1 and inhibits activation of NF-kappaB and STAT3, thereby inducing apoptosis of activated T lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The inhibition of purine metabolism and induction of T-cell apoptosis both depend upon intracellular metabolites for the antineoplastic and immune-modulating effects of AZA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In our experience, starting the AZA at a low dose sometimes abrogates the nausea and vomiting. By comparison, diarrhea occurs in less than 1 percent of patients, and a mild elevation of liver enzymes occurs in approximately 5 percent. Progression to cirrhosis has not been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Dramatic gastrointestinal hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in a few patients, characterized by nausea, vomiting, and often diarrhea and fever. Other nonspecific symptoms that should alert the clinician to this hypersensitivity syndrome include rash, myalgias, malaise, elevation of liver enzymes, and occasional hypotension, all occurring within the first few weeks of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dose-related marrow suppression results in leukopenia in up to 27 percent of patients and thrombocytopenia in up to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21</a>]. Mild leukopenia usually responds to a reduction in the daily dose of AZA, which is done mostly when the absolute neutrophil count is less than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) is less than 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Use of AZA in addition to glucocorticoids with a low ALC is a risk factor for opportunistic infections such as <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> pneumonia (PCP), and, on a case-by-case basis, a decision is required to determine if the risk is warranted and if antibiotic prophylaxis is appropriate. Thrombocytopenia occurs in up to 5 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Unless platelets are below <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL,</span> which is uncommon, clinical bleeding or need for concurrent antiplatelet drug therapy dose reduction is typically not required.</p><p>As noted above, 0.3 percent of normal subjects have very low levels of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT); this abnormality is genetically determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. The ensuing reduction in AZA metabolism results in a significant risk for myelosuppression and a macrocytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Most authorities, however, would recommend that AZA be avoided during pregnancy in women being treated for RA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">DOSING AND MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally use an initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (AZA) of 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> and we obtain a complete blood count (CBC) after two weeks of therapy to assure that the counts are stable. We then usually increase the daily dose by 50 mg (or approximately 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> each week to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span>. In patients with a higher target dose for a given medical condition or with an inadequate response after three months of therapy, we increase the dose as tolerated up to a maximum typically of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span>. A lower dose is indicated in patients with renal insufficiency.</p><p>A CBC and platelet count should be monitored every two weeks during dose escalation and every four to six weeks after a stable dose is achieved. Some experts suggest liver enzyme testing every six to eight weeks during AZA therapy.</p><p>In patients who develop leukopenia (white blood cells <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;4000/microL)</span> or thrombocytopenia (platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL)</span> during therapy, the AZA dose should be reduced by 50 percent or the drug should be discontinued. If a 50 percent reduction in the dose is associated with persistent cytopenia, then AZA should generally be permanently discontinued. Patients who develop macrocytosis should be closely monitored with more frequent CBCs (eg, initially every two weeks for a month) once other major causes of macrocytosis have been excluded, including vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. Stable mild macrocytosis in the absence of vitamin deficiency is a potential side effect that is well-tolerated and does not require discontinuation of medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1122252\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a> (AZA) is a derivative of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thioguanine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thioguanine</a>, a purine-mimic antimetabolite. It is well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has a biologic half-life of approximately 24 hours. AZA is a prodrug; the action of glutathione in red blood cells causes the formation of the principal metabolite, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). The prodrug AZA is approximately 30 percent protein-bound. Forty-five percent of the drug is excreted in the urine; the remainder is metabolized to 6-MP, which is then further metabolized along competing routes. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Metabolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The metabolism of 6-MP is by competing routes: catabolic oxidation to 6-thiouric acid, which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidase, and metabolism along an anabolic pathway to several metabolites, for which two enzymes are responsible: thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Metabolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative accumulation of 6-MP metabolites depends upon genetic polymorphisms of the individual enzymes. The toxicity of AZA and 6-MP is predominantly related the activity of TPMT. Deficiency of this enzyme causes 6-MP to be preferentially metabolized toward 6-thioguanine (6-TG) nucleotides, which appear to account for much of the toxicity related to 6-MP. Low TPMT activity has been observed in up to 11 percent of the population, with 0.3 percent having negligible activity. Analysis of the <em>TPMT</em> gene by use of commercially available genotyping or functional assays for the enzyme prior to the administration of AZA may help predict those individuals at risk for severe toxicity. However, other genes are also likely to play a role in determining AZA toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Metabolism'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacogenetics and TPMT testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracellular metabolites of 6-MP are responsible for a reduction in intracellular purine synthesis and for the antineoplastic and immune-modulating effects of AZA. Serum drug levels are, therefore, of little value in monitoring treatment. AZA causes decreased numbers of circulating B and T lymphocytes, reduced immunoglobulin synthesis, diminished interleukin (IL)-2 secretion, and inhibition of the intracellular signaling downstream of T-cell costimulation involving CD28-mediated pathways. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of toxicity of AZA in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is comparable with that of other traditional nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and AZA must be administered with great caution. The most common side effects of AZA at doses typically used in the treatment of rheumatic diseases include gastrointestinal intolerance, bone marrow suppression, and infection. The increase in relative risk of malignancy in patients with RA is small, in contrast with the effects of AZA in renal transplant recipients. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major drug interaction with AZA is with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febuxostat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">febuxostat</a>, which slow the elimination of 6-MP by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. Thus, the dose of AZA should be reduced significantly (50 to 75 percent) in patients treated with allopurinol, but this combination should be avoided if possible. Use of AZA with febuxostat should also be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H2696869897\" class=\"local\">'Xanthine oxidase inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the treatment of rheumatic diseases, AZA is generally begun at a dose of 25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for two weeks to test for drug hypersensitivity and serve as a screen for <em>TPMT</em> homozygous deficiency. The dose is then increased incrementally by 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> every four to six weeks until the desired response is seen or until a maximal total dose of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> is reached. A lower dose is indicated in patients with renal insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count should be monitored every two weeks during dose escalation and every four to six weeks after a stable dose is achieved. Some experts suggest liver enzyme testing every six to eight weeks during AZA therapy. The AZA dose should be reduced or discontinued in patients who develop leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. Patients who develop macrocytosis should be more closely monitored once the usual causes, such as vitamin B12 deficiency, have been excluded.
