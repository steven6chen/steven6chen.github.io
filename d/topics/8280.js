Fortunately, the use of certain HIV medications during pregnancy and labor can dramatically reduce the risk of passing HIV to the infant. </p><p>However, not all women are aware that they are infected with HIV. Therefore, experts strongly recommend that <strong>all</strong> pregnant women undergo screening for HIV infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testing-for-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Testing for HIV (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review discusses factors that can reduce HIV transmission from mothers to babies in developed countries such as North America. Therapies that may be useful in the developing world are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-mother-to-child-hiv-transmission-in-resource-limited-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission in resource-limited settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CARE BEFORE PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have HIV should talk to their HIV specialist and an obstetrician before trying to become pregnant. Most medications are safe during pregnancy, and most women do not need to switch medications when they get pregnant, but this should ideally be discussed before pregnancy. It is also important to take your HIV medications regularly. Women who have complete viral suppression (no virus detected in their blood) have a much lower risk of passing HIV to their baby than women who have virus detected in their blood. </p><p>A number of studies have been done to better understand how HIV infection and HIV treatment affect the health of women and infants. Pregnancy does not appear to worsen HIV or increase the risk of death from HIV. It is not clear if HIV or HIV treatments increase the risk of pregnancy complications, such as prematurity, low birth weight, and stillbirth. However, it is very clear that certain HIV medications can significantly reduce the risk that the infant will become infected with HIV when the medication is taken during pregnancy and labor, and then given to the infant after delivery. That is why HIV treatment guidelines strongly recommend a combination of medications to prevent the transmission of HIV to an infant from an HIV-infected mother. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'HIV medication regimens'</a> below.)</p><p>Talk to your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of taking HIV medications during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CARE DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with HIV usually require the assistance of several healthcare providers during pregnancy, including an HIV specialist and obstetrical care provider, possibly a high risk obstetrician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After your pregnancy is confirmed, you should meet with your HIV specialist and obstetrical provider. During these visits, you will discuss how to manage your HIV during pregnancy and minimize the risk of passing HIV to your infant.</p><p>During the initial evaluation, you will have blood tests to determine the amount of HIV virus in your blood (eg, HIV viral load) and the strength of your immune system (eg, the number of CD4 T cells). If you are not taking HIV medications, you will also have a blood test to look for mutations in the HIV virus, but you do not have to wait for the results to start HIV medications. You may also have other blood tests to evaluate general health and to monitor side effects of medications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">HIV medication regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During pregnancy, all women with HIV are advised to take combination antiretroviral regimens using three HIV drugs. Women who become pregnant while on a regimen that successfully controls the virus can usually continue that same regimen. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of HIV medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies suggest that women who start HIV medications earlier in pregnancy are more likely to have a low amount of virus in the blood by the time of delivery. We recommend that women start HIV medications as soon as possible during pregnancy if they are not already taking them. However, some women may prefer to start after the first trimester of pregnancy because of difficulty taking pills due to nausea related to pregnancy. You should discuss this with your doctor. Once started, HIV medications are continued throughout pregnancy to prevent HIV transmission to the fetus, and they are continued indefinitely postpartum because of benefits to the woman.</p><p>Zidovudine is a medication that is recommended for some women intravenously just prior to delivery and orally for the infant for six weeks after birth. Information about other HIV medications is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Initial treatment of HIV (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tips-for-taking-hiv-medications-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Tips for taking HIV medications (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Medication adherence during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is extremely important to take your medications exactly as prescribed during pregnancy to decrease the risk of developing drug resistance. Furthermore, taking your medications on time can lessen the risk of HIV transmission to the baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Medications to avoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are some HIV medications that should not be used during pregnancy except in certain circumstances, but most of these medications are not commonly used. Talk to your healthcare provider about the safety of HIV medications during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Throughout your pregnancy, you will see your obstetrical provider and HIV specialist at regular intervals. During these visits, you will have routine obstetrical care as well as HIV monitoring, including blood testing of your CD4 count and HIV viral load.</p><p>An early ultrasound is recommended to obtain an accurate due date. A detailed ultrasound is usually recommended at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy to evaluate the growing fetus. A follow-up ultrasound may be recommended during the second <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> third trimester to monitor the fetus' growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">LABOR AND DELIVERY WITH HIV</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2583808\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications during labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HIV drug zidovudine is given through an intravenous catheter during labor when the woman does not have a low amount of HIV in the blood near the time of delivery, regardless of how the woman delivers. In these cases, zidovudine helps to reduce the risk of HIV transmission. Women who are taking combination HIV medications should continue them on schedule during labor or before a cesarean section; this helps to provide maximal protection to the mother and infant and to minimize the risk that the mother could develop drug resistance due to a missed dose of medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2583815\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safest way for women with HIV to deliver a baby (ie, by vaginal or cesarean delivery), depends upon her HIV viral load during pregnancy. In general, a vaginal delivery is preferred for the safety of both mother and infant if the risk of transmission of HIV is low (when the HIV viral load is low). For women with high levels of virus in their blood or who are very concerned about infant exposure to infected blood or vaginal fluids, a cesarean section is recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral load &lt;1000 copies/mL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women with HIV who have been taking HIV medications throughout pregnancy and have a HIV viral load &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> when evaluated within four to six weeks of delivery may choose to have a vaginal delivery. In this situation, the risk of transmitting HIV to the infant during a vaginal delivery is very low, and it is not clear that a cesarean delivery will decrease this risk any further [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. You should discuss the risks and benefits of cesarean versus vaginal delivery with your obstetrical provider. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral load &ge;1000 copies/mL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women with HIV who have taken HIV medications throughout pregnancy but have a viral load above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> at 34 to 36 weeks of pregnancy are usually advised to have a cesarean delivery before they go into labor rather than a vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this situation, the cesarean is usually scheduled at 38 weeks of pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CARE AFTER DELIVERY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">For women after delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After delivery, women who took HIV medications during pregnancy should discuss the benefits that continuing HIV medications has on her own health with her doctor. This decision is best made along with an HIV specialist. Ongoing care and support services, including HIV-related medical care, psychosocial support (including screening for postpartum depression and medication adherence support), and assistance with family planning and birth control, can help the woman to care for the needs of herself and her family. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-control-which-method-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Birth control; which method is right for me? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with HIV who breastfeed can pass HIV to the infant. In one study of over 600 mother-infant pairs from Malawi, the risk of transmitting HIV to the infant through breastmilk was 7 percent for infants who breastfed for one year and 10 percent for infants who breastfed for up to two years.</p><p>In the United States and other resource-rich countries, clean water and infant formulas are readily available and are safe alternatives to breastfeeding. Therefore, the United States Public Health Service recommends that women in resource-rich countries who are infected with HIV not breastfeed their babies, even if the woman is taking HIV medications. While risk of HIV transmission through breast milk can be lowered by HIV medications, HIV can still be transmitted through breastmilk, even if the woman is taking HIV medications.</p><p>The same advice cannot be given to women in resource-poor countries because safe alternatives to breastmilk (eg, clean water and formula) may not be consistently available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">For newborns and infants</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">HIV treatment regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants of women with HIV are usually treated with zidovudine for the first four to six weeks of life. Zidovudine can help to prevent the infant from becoming infected with HIV as a result of exposure to the mother's blood during delivery.</p><p>In certain situations, another HIV medication may be given instead of or in addition to zidovudine. Talk to your child's healthcare provider to determine which HIV medication is best.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Testing infants for HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normally, adults and children undergo HIV antibody testing to see if they are infected with HIV. However, HIV antibody tests are not accurate in infants since HIV antibodies may be transferred from the mother to the baby. This may result in the infant having a positive HIV antibody test. However, this does not mean that the baby necessarily has HIV infection.</p><p>For this reason, a special test that directly measures the virus itself is performed in infants to see if they are infected. If this specialized virus test (called HIV PCR test) is negative, then the baby is not infected with HIV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term follow-up of children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of infants who were exposed to zidovudine and who did not become infected with HIV have not shown any increased risk of serious problems with growth, the immune system, brain function, cancers, or other problems for up to six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Much of the available long-term follow-up data on infants exposed to HIV medications are with zidovudine or older drugs. Most HIV-infected women now receive newer combination antiretroviral regimens, so studies need to continue to assess long-term effects of these medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=3694\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
