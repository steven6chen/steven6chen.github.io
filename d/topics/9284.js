The number of international adoptions peaked at nearly 23,000 in 2004 and has declined since then (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91056\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91056 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In 2015, 5648 children were adopted internationally from 88 countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The majority of children came from China (42 percent). More than 100 children were adopted from each of 12 other countries, including Ethiopia, South Korea, Ukraine, and Uganda.

Since 2003, there has been a steady decline in children &le;1 years of age available for adoption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and nearly all of the children available and adopted from China have special medical or developmental needs.</p><p>Most internationally adopted children have resided all or most of their lives in orphanages or other institutional settings. However, children adopted from South Korea typically are cared for in state-subsidized foster care homes and some children adopted from China may have spent some time in foster care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75599585\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION IN BIRTH COUNTRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States State Department requires that internationally adopted children undergo a medical examination in their birth country (a &quot;panel evaluation&quot;) by a United States designated physician before admission into the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The evaluation is required to complete the visa application and is limited to screening for serious physical and mental disorders and certain communicable diseases (eg, tuberculosis, syphilis). Re-evaluation for these conditions and evaluation for other illnesses and infections should be performed after arrival to the adoptive country. (See <a href=\"#H75599593\" class=\"local\">'Post-arrival evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Medical records should be available for review at the time of the preadoption medical evaluation.

Additional laboratory testing may include a complete blood count in China and Ethiopia and hepatitis C testing in Ethiopia. Laboratory results must be interpreted with caution because they may have been performed months before the preadoption evaluation (typically at time of entry to the institution or at birth) and the child may have become infected after testing.

In general, the prevalence of infectious diseases is highest in children from Africa and lowest in children from South Korea. Direct comparison of prevalence from one country to another is limited by significant variation in the age of adoptees at the time of arrival. In addition, some children were adopted with known hepatitis B infection in special needs adoptions.

In several observational studies published between 2006 and 2014, the prevalence of acute hepatitis A infection (positive HAV IgM) upon arrival to the host country ranged from 1 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/14,19,20,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19,20,33</a>].

In one study, the highest region-specific prevalence was in Africa (72 percent) and the lowest was in the <span class=\"nowrap\">Asia/Pacific</span> Rim Region (17 percent); past infection increased with age (13 percent in children &lt;2 years versus 80 percent in those 12 to 17 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Virtually all people residing in resource-poor countries have HAV IgG antibodies, indicative of past infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57931 \">figure 2</a>), by early adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Despite the low prevalence of acute infection, internationally adopted children may be incubating HAV infection at the time of adoption and may transmit it to their adoptive families or other contacts while in country or after arrival to the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/14,19,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19,35-38</a>]. Children with acute HAV infection may shed the virus for months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Thus, adoptive parents and accompanying family members should be immunized against HAV or have documented immunity to HAV before international travel to receive their child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/19,32,34,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,32,34,38</a>]. HAV vaccine is also recommended for susceptible nontraveling individuals who plan to have close contact with an internationally adopted child from a country with high or intermediate hepatitis A endemicity (high endemicity: parts of Africa and Asia; intermediate endemicity: Central and South America, Eastern Europe, parts of Asia); the first dose of the vaccine should be administered before the child's arrival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/11,34,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,34,38</a>].

If the child has acute HAV infection (positive anti-HAV IgM antibody), secondary cases can be prevented by providing HAV vaccine to unvaccinated family members and close contacts of the case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/11,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,39</a>].

Children who have evidence of past infection (ie, positive total [IgM and IgG] or IgG HAV antibody (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57931 \">figure 2</a>)) do not require immunization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173167747\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatitis B virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend routine screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection for internationally adopted children upon arrival, regardless of results provided in the country of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>].</p><p>Screening is necessary to identify asymptomatic carriers, who may nonetheless transmit HBV to household contacts and caregivers. Early identification permits appropriate management of the adopted child and preventive measures for contacts (eg, HBV vaccination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HBV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a>).

Some centers, including the author's, repeat testing approximately six months after arrival for children who initially test negative for HBsAg, HBsAb, and anti-HBc, in case the child was infected with HBV just before arrival. In infants and young children, passively acquired maternal anti-HBs may be detected until eight months of age; passively acquired maternal anti-HBc may be detected until 24 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thus, in children with initial testing done at &lt;12 months of age, repeat testing is done after 12 months of age to determine if the anti-HBs is still present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children who are positive for HBsAg can transmit HBV to others. They require additional testing to determine whether they have acute or chronic infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60827\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60827 \">table 3</a>). In addition, serology for hepatitis e antigen (HBeAg), HBV e antibody (anti-HBe), a quantitative HBV polymerase chain reaction (viral load) and liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin) should be done. These children should also have serologic testing for hepatitis A virus (to determine the need for vaccine) and hepatitis C virus (because concomitant hepatitis C virus infection may affect management). Those who are adopted from North Africa, parts of South America, and the Mediterranean Basin should also be tested for hepatitis D virus (delta virus) infection, if such testing is available. Children with HBV should be followed by a hepatologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatitis B virus infection in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-epidemiology-natural-history-and-clinical-manifestations-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, and clinical manifestations of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hepatitis-d-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hepatitis D virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rates of HBV infection in internationally adopted children generally are similar to the reported rates of HBV in the country of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/17,18,22-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,22-30</a>]. In a systematic review, the 2005 prevalence of HBV infection generally ranged between 2 and 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Adoptees typically acquire HBV perinatally, although bloodborne infection and horizontal transmission also are possible. Universal HBV immunization for infants is provided in many countries of origin. However, the first dose may not be administered at birth (the birth dose is necessary to prevent perinatal transmission), and the full series may not be completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Nearly all birth countries routinely screen for HBV and report results in the adoption referral information. Chronic HBV infection is considered to be a &quot;special need&quot; because children with chronic HBV infection are at risk for long-term liver disease and will need to be followed by a hepatologist throughout their lifetime. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatitis B virus infection in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173167762\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatitis C virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend routine screening for hepatitis C virus infection for internationally adopted children upon arrival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/international-adoption-infectious-disease-aspects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The prevalence of hepatitis C is increased in the countries of origin of international adoptees and it is difficult to obtain information about risk factors. In some countries (eg, Eastern Europe, Taiwan, and Ethiopia) hepatitis C testing may have been performed before the adoption, but repeat testing should be performed regardless of these results.
