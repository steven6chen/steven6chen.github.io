In a series from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, the mean annual incidence in the United States from 1977 to 2003 was 0.06 per 100,000 women, compared with 6.6 and 1.2 for squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Although the disease has been described in women from 22 to 87 years of age, the mean age at diagnosis of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix is about 45 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>There had been some uncertainty about whether cervical neuroendocrine cancers are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV).

The less common large cell variant, although histologically distinct, shares the same natural history and is treated similarly. The least common type of neuroendocrine cancer that arises in the cervix, a well-differentiated carcinoid tumor, exhibits the typical carcinoid features seen elsewhere in the body (non-existent or minimal cytologic atypia, rare or no mitotic figures, no necrosis), has a different natural history and treatment, and is not discussed further in this review. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1336437728\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients typically present with abdominopelvic symptoms such as vaginal bleeding or discharge, pelvic pain, or pelvic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Few patients are asymptomatic or present solely after an abnormal Pap smear result.</p><p>Often, a pelvic mass is present on clinical exam. Low quality data suggest that the majority have bulky disease at the time of diagnosis. For example, in a review of 188 patients with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix, early (stage I to IIA), advanced (stage IIB to IVA), and metastatic (stage IVB) disease was diagnosed in 135, 45, and 8 women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In addition, patients may present with a paraneoplastic syndrome such as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), Cushing syndrome, hypercalcemia, or a neurologic disorder. The most commonly involved organs include the liver, adrenals, bone, bone marrow, and the brain.

In addition, immunohistochemistry staining for p63 may confirm a squamous histologic origin. In contrast, neuroendocrine markers might not be helpful, as approximately 40 percent of non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas can show neuroendocrine differentiation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H960912999\"><span class=\"h2\">Undifferentiated carcinomas of lower uterine segment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carcinoma of the lower uterine segment (LUS) accounts for approximately 3 to 6 percent of all endometrial cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help determine whether the primary emanates from the uterus or the cervix. However, immunohistochemistry may not be useful because undifferentiated carcinomas of the LUS can occasionally show focal positivity for neuroendocrine markers. Therefore, clinicians should rely on clinical findings to differentiate between the two entities. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H960913005\"><span class=\"h2\">Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is positive for muscle markers, including desmin, myogenin, and myo-D1.

In one review, only 72 cases were reported in the English literature between 2000 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These tumors typically consist of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), present as mass lesions, and respond to combination therapy (chemotherapy plus immunotherapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

However, isolated metastatic involvement of the cervix appears to be exceedingly rare. As an example, the most common sites of distant metastases from small cell carcinoma of the lung are the liver, adrenal glands, bones, and brain.

Histologically, pure small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix is indistinguishable from small cell carcinoma of the lung and extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma of other sites.

The cells of the large cell variant of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are distinguished by the presence of prominent nucleoli, vesicular nuclei with a more granular chromatin pattern, and variable amounts of cytoplasm. Neuroendocrine differentiation is demonstrated with pan-neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin A (CGA), synaptophysin, and neuron-specific enolase. &#160;</p><p>Both large and small cell types may be present in the same tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>]. In either case, the neoplastic cells are typically arranged in clusters, sheets, or trabeculae, separated by a delicate fibrovascular stroma. Nuclear molding is a distinctive and characteristic finding in well-preserved specimens, although &quot;crush&quot; artifact is more frequently observed. Mitotic rates are high, and necrosis of individual tumor cells is common. The natural history and treatment of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma is similar to small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and will not be discussed separately. In some cases, there are admixed foci of in situ or invasive adenocarcinoma or squamous cell cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/11,17,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17,23,24</a>].

Because of the histologic, prognostic, and therapeutic similarities between cervical small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and small cell lung cancer, the staging of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma has often been adapted to the two-stage staging system widely used for small cell lung cancer, as originally defined by the Veterans&rsquo; Affairs Lung Study Group (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited-stage disease &ndash; This is characterized by disease that can be encompassed within a single radiation therapy (RT) port. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive-stage disease &ndash; This is defined as disease that cannot be encompassed in a single RT port.</p><p/><p>This two-tiered staging system recognizes the systemic nature of the disease and also serves to define a subset of patients who might benefit from combined modality therapy.

While the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system describes the extent and burden of disease more accurately than does the simple designation of limited- versus extensive-stage disease, there is overlap in prognosis between stage groupings, particularly stages II and III.

In our institution, initial surgery (consisting of hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy) is an appropriate option for patients with small (&lt;4 cm) cervical lesions with no clear parametrial disease and no evidence of metastatic disease. For a tumor &gt;4 cm with known small cell histology, we begin with combined modality therapy (chemotherapy and radiation therapy [RT]). Surgery can then be considered in the adjuvant setting if the patient responds to the primary treatment and there continues to be no evidence of metastatic disease. Our approach is consistent with guidance from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>A role for surgery in patients with apparently early-stage disease is supported by the observation that most series report long-term survival only for those patients who have undergone surgical resection in the context of multimodality treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].<br/><br/>This was shown in a combined analysis of 188 patients derived from both institutional experience and literature review where the major findings consisted of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A radical hysterectomy was an independent prognostic factor for survival in multivariate analysis (as were early-stage disease and the use of any chemotherapy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with stage I to IIA disease, five-year survival was significantly higher for those undergoing versus not undergoing radical hysterectomy (38 versus 24 percent). </p><p/><p>However, because of the retrospective nature of the study, the contribution of the surgical procedure may have been overestimated because patients who were fit to undergo and selected for radical hysterectomy may have a better prognosis than those patients who were not selected to undergo surgery. </p><p>On the other hand, other small series suggest that surgery plays little role among patients receiving definitive chemoradiation. For example, among 31 patients who were treated on chemoradiation protocols (29 of whom had a cervical biopsy alone), the three-year disease-free rate was 80 and 38 percent among those with early-stage versus advanced-stage disease, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/small-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma-of-the-cervix/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H804878944\"><span class=\"h3\">Fertility-sparing surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the early propensity for hematogenous spread despite locally negative resection margins and due to the limited prognosis, fertility-sparing surgery is not a recommended treatment option for young patients with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.</p><p>Concerns about fertility preservation are particularly common among women with gynecologic malignancies.
