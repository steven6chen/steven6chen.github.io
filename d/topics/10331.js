For over a century, open appendectomy was the only standard treatment for appendicitis. Contemporary management of appendicitis is more sophisticated and nuanced: laparoscopic appendectomy has surpassed open appendectomy in usage, some patients with perforated appendicitis may benefit from initial antibiotic therapy followed by interval appendectomy, and several European trials have even suggested that it is feasible to treat uncomplicated appendicitis nonoperatively with antibiotics alone. </p><p>The management of appendicitis in <strong>adults</strong> will be reviewed here.

For adult patients with nonperforated appendicitis, we recommend timely appendectomy, either open or laparoscopically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F115333\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115333 \">algorithm 1</a>). Antibiotics can be used to augment rather than to replace surgery. For the past 120 years, appendectomy has withstood the test of time as a safe, effective, and definitive therapy for appendicitis. (See <a href=\"#H9259945\" class=\"local\">'Appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Despite evidence that antibiotics alone may be sufficient for managing the initial presentation of appendicitis, we suggest against its <strong>routine</strong> use for adult patients presenting with uncomplicated appendicitis. We feel that its routine application in clinical practice is premature because of many unanswered questions (eg, patient selection, recurrent attacks, and missed neoplasm).

Many more systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>]. From these publications, we know that: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients treated with antibiotics respond clinically with a reduction in white blood cell count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], avoidance of peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and general symptom reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,9</a>]. Compared with those who underwent immediate appendectomy, patients treated with antibiotics have lower or similar pain scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>], require fewer doses of narcotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], have a quicker return to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], and do not have a higher perforation rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 90 percent of patients treated with antibiotics are able to avoid surgery during the initial admission.

The other 30 percent eventually require appendectomy for recurrent appendicitis or symptoms of abdominal pain (mean time to appendectomy 4.2 to 7 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]). </p><p/><p>Another randomized trial from Korea went a step further and compared supportive care alone versus antibiotics in 245 adults with computed tomography (CT)-verified uncomplicated appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Approximately three-quarters of the patients screened were excluded; exclusion criteria included appendiceal diameter &gt;11 mm, appendicolith, and complicated appendicitis. Patients treated with supportive care alone did just as well as patients treated with four days of antibiotics. Approximately 7 percent in each group failed initial treatment, with most requiring appendectomy; an additional 13 to 16 percent in each group had recurrences during the 19-month follow-up, with most requiring appendectomy. The initial treatment failure rate and recurrence rate with and without antibiotics are strikingly similar to those of earlier randomized trials, indicating that perhaps supportive care, not antibiotics, was responsible for the success of nonoperative therapy. </p><p>It is conceivable that whether appendicitis can be managed nonoperatively is predetermined by the underlying pathophysiology, and that patients whose appendicitis is destined to resolve without surgery will improve with or without antibiotics. However, although such patients represent the majority (70 to 90 percent of those who present with nonperforated appendicitis), they cannot be reliably identified a priori based on currently available clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data, and, more importantly, neither can patients who are destined to fail nonoperative management be selected for early appendectomy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite the mounting evidence for nonoperative management of nonperforated appendicitis, we remain concerned about the following issues:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic therapy is intended for patients with nonperforated (uncomplicated) appendicitis only. However, preoperative abdominal CT cannot reliably distinguish uncomplicated appendicitis from complicated disease. In one trial, for example, among patients in the appendectomy arm, 20 percent had complicated appendicitis identified at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients with fecaliths on imaging have a high rate of complicated appendicitis (up to 40 percent). Thus, nonoperative management is not recommended for those patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/5,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonoperative management poses a greater risk for patients who are older, immunocompromised, or have medical comorbidities. In such patients, the severity of the disease may be underestimated, and the risk of unexpected lesions in the appendix, such as carcinoid and carcinoma, may be higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. Although such high-risk patients could potentially benefit the most from nonsurgical treatment of appendicitis, they were excluded from all trials. Thus, the efficacy of the antibiotic-first approach to management of appendicitis in this group of patients remains unknown. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Unexpected intraoperative findings'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>For a small minority of patients with either prior history of surgical complications or severe phobia to appendectomy, a nonoperative approach could be offered as an alternative to immediate surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F115333\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115333 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Current treatment strategies derived from trial protocols call for initial intravenous antibiotics for one to three days, followed by oral antibiotics for up to 10 days; the choices of antibiotics are not standardized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients are typically admitted to the hospital during the first one to three days for close observation in case of clinical deterioration, which requires prompt rescue appendectomy. It is unclear whether antibiotic treatment increases hospital utilization, and therefore cost, both during the initial phase of treatment and for recurrences. Patients who choose nonoperative treatment should be warned of a recurrence rate that is typically 15 to 25 percent but may be up to 38 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/5,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27</a>]. It is also unclear whether the success in avoiding immediate surgery justifies the fear and burden of potential recurrence or missed appendiceal neoplasm (especially in older adults).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9259945\"><span class=\"h2\">Appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The current standard treatment for appendicitis is appendectomy, which can be performed open or laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206304441\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of appendectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients present with appendicitis at all times of the day. Whether a stable patient with nonperforated appendicitis requires surgery overnight or the next morning is controversial. However, a meta-analysis of 11 nonrandomized studies showed that a short in-hospital delay of 12 to 24 hours before surgery in that patient population was not associated with an increased risk of perforation (odds ratio [OR] 0.97, 95% CI 0.78-1.19) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The randomized trials on treating appendicitis with antibiotics alone also provided additional indirect evidence in support of its safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, delaying appendectomy for &gt;48 hours was associated with increased surgical site infections and other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>The timing of surgery also depends on the availability of surgeons and operating room resources. Hospitals staffed with an around-the-clock in-house acute care surgical service and operating room crew may perform an appendectomy whenever an operating room is available, day or night. For hospital without such resources, appendectomy when the operating room opens the next morning is appropriate. In either situation, for acute nonperforated appendicitis in a stable patient, we recommend appendectomy within 12 hours. Patients should be admitted to the hospital and receive intravenous hydration, pain control, and intravenous antibiotics while awaiting surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute appendicitis require adequate hydration with intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and perioperative antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The patient's vital signs and urine output should be closely monitored; a Foley catheter may be required in severely dehydrated patients. Once the decision has been made to perform an operation for acute appendicitis, the patient should proceed to the operating room with as little delay as possible to minimize the chance of progression to perforation.

The flora of the appendix reflects that of the colon and includes gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. </p><p>Patients proceeding directly from the emergency room to the operating room for appendectomy without further delay should receive prophylactic antibiotics within a 60-minute &quot;window&quot; before the initial incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In general, a single preoperative antibiotic dose for surgical wound prophylaxis is adequate. Guidelines established by the Medical Letter and the Surgical Care Improvement Project suggest the following options for appendectomy: a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a> (2 g IV) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a> (2 g IV), or the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> (2 g if &lt;120 kg or 3 g if &ge;120 kg IV) PLUS <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> (500 mg IV), or, in patients allergic to penicillins and cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> PLUS one of the following: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aztreonam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aztreonam</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

Thus, prehospital use of aspirin or clopidogrel should not preclude or delay laparoscopic appendectomy. </p><p>Patients who present at night and will not undergo appendectomy until the next morning should be admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous antibiotics as soon as possible (often in the emergency room), rather than waiting until just before surgery. In this case, we suggest choosing antibiotics from the list intended for patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">perforated/complicated</span> appendicitis to provide broad-spectrum coverage (see <a href=\"#H911197363\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics for perforated appendicitis'</a> below).

As a result, the operative approach in patients with suspected appendicitis is best decided by the surgeon based on personal experience, institutional capabilities, and individual patient factors such as the confidence in the diagnosis; history of prior surgery; the patient's age, gender, and body habitus; and severity of disease. Evidence suggests that laparoscopy may be the preferred approach in these following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An uncertain diagnosis &ndash; The laparoscopic approach provides an advantage in patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain since it permits inspection of other abdominal organs. This benefit may be greater for women of childbearing age, who traditionally have had higher negative appendectomy rates, and in whom laparoscopy may reveal other causes of pelvic pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/21,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,44</a>].

Although open appendectomy preceded it by almost 100 years, laparoscopic appendectomy has overtaken its open counterpart in popularity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/37-39,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39,49</a>].

These methods share the principle of triangulation of instrument ports to ensure adequate visualization and exposure of the appendix. In one method, pneumoperitoneum is obtained through a 12-mm periumbilical port, through which the laparoscope is inserted and exploratory laparoscopy performed. The other two ports are placed under direct vision: a 5-mm port in the left lower quadrant and a 5-mm suprapubic port in the midline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F78264\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78264 \">figure 1</a>). If a 5-mm laparoscope is used, it can be placed through the left lower quadrant trocar, and the umbilical 12-mm trocar can be used for a stapler. Most staplers require a 12-mm port.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When the appendix is located in the retrocecal position, good triangulation of instruments can also be achieved with a 12-mm port placed in the upper midline. This port allows instruments or the laparoscope to be positioned for access to the gutter between the right colon and the abdominal wall. If the risk for open conversion is high, all midline incisions should be oriented vertically so they can easily be incorporated into a lower midline incision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An alternative abdominal access method to conventional laparoscopy is single-incision laparoscopy, in which all instruments and the laparoscope are inserted through a multi-channel portal placed at the umbilicus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials comparing single-incision with conventional laparoscopic appendectomy, single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy was associated with a shorter length of stay and a quicker return to activities but a longer operative time and a higher conversion rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mobilization</strong> &ndash; Once the diseased appendix is identified, any adhesions to surrounding structures can be lysed with a combination of blunt and sharp dissection. If a retrocecal appendix is encountered, division of the lateral peritoneal attachments of the cecum to the abdominal wall often improves visualization. Care must be taken to avoid underlying retroperitoneal structures, specifically the right ureter and iliac vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mesoappendix dissection</strong> &ndash; The appendix or mesoappendix can be gently grasped with a Babcock clamp and retracted anteriorly. The appendiceal artery, or mesoappendix containing it, can be divided sharply between hemostatic clips, with a laparoscopic gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapler, monopolar cautery, or one of the advanced vessel ligation devices (eg, ultrasonic scalpel or LigaSure). The various technologies differ in operating time and cost but not in patient-important outcomes such as complication rate and length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Thus, surgeons may choose a technique based on <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> personal experience, the condition of the appendix, and available resources. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Appendix transection</strong> &ndash; The appendix is cleared to its attachment with the cecum, and the appendiceal base is divided using a laparoscopic GIA stapler, taking care not to leave a significant stump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. It is sometimes necessary to include part of the cecum within the stapler to ensure that the staples are placed in healthy, uninfected tissue. Alternatively, the appendix can be divided sharply between endoloops. Using endoloops to close the appendiceal stump takes longer time but costs less than using a laparoscopic GIA stapler; otherwise, the length of stay and complication rate (including that of intra-abdominal abscess) do not differ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Thus, each surgeon may choose the method of appendiceal stump closure based on <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> personal preference, the condition of the appendix, and available resources. Other methods of appendiceal stump closure have been described (eg, suture knot, clip, LigaSure) but are less commonly used due to limited data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The appendiceal stump is typically not inverted after laparoscopic appendectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Closure</strong> &ndash; The appendix is then removed through the umbilical port in a specimen bag to prevent wound infection. The operative field is inspected for hemostasis and irrigated with saline if needed, and then the fascial defect and skin incisions are closed. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Open techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open appendectomy was described by McBurney in 1891 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Since then, the technique has remained largely unchanged.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anesthesia</strong> &ndash; Open appendectomy in adults can be performed under general or regional (spinal) anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incision</strong> &ndash; The patient should be reexamined after the induction of general anesthesia, as this allows deep palpation of the abdomen. If a mass representing the inflamed appendix can be palpated, the incision can be located over the mass. If no appendiceal mass is detected, the incision should be centered over McBurney's point, one-third of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. A curvilinear incision in a skin fold allows for an excellent cosmetic result.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is important not to make the incision too medial or too lateral. An incision placed too medially opens onto the anterior rectus sheath, rather than the desired oblique muscles, while an incision placed too laterally may be lateral to the abdominal cavity. The incision can be oriented transversely or obliquely (perpendicular to the line connecting the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53185\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53185 \">figure 2</a>). Some surgeons prefer a transverse incision because it can be more easily extended to increased exposure if needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mobilization and resection</strong> &ndash; The dissection begins through the subcutaneous tissue to the external oblique fascia, which is sharply incised lateral to the rectus sheath. Using a muscle-splitting technique, the external oblique is bluntly separated in the direction of the muscle fibers; the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles are bluntly separated in a similar fashion. The peritoneum is sharply entered, avoiding injury to the underlying intestine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The surgeon can often locate the appendix by sweeping a finger laterally to medially in the right paracolic gutter. Thin adhesions between the appendix and surrounding structures may generally be freed with blunt dissection; occasionally, sharp dissection is required for more dense adhesions. If the appendix cannot be identified through palpation, it can be located by following the teniae coli to its origin at the cecal base.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once identified and freed from adhesions, the appendix is delivered through the incision. The mesoappendix may be grasped with a Babcock clamp, taking care not to tear the appendiceal wall and cause spillage of enteric contents. The appendiceal artery, which runs in the mesoappendix, is divided between hemostats and tied with 3-0 absorbable sutures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A nonabsorbable purse-string suture is placed in the cecal wall around the appendix. After crushing the appendiceal base with a Kelly clamp, the appendix is doubly tied with 2-0 absorbable sutures. The appendix is excised with a scalpel, and the remaining stump is cauterized to prevent a mucocele. The appendiceal stump is typically inverted into the cecum while the purse-string suture is tightened, although the usefulness of stump inversion is debatable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/59-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-65</a>]. The surgical bed is then irrigated with saline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Closure</strong> &ndash; The incision is closed in layers with running 2-0 absorbable suture, beginning with the peritoneum, followed by the transversus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique. Irrigation is performed at each layer. To improve analgesia and limit postoperative narcotic requirements, the external oblique fascia may be injected with local anesthetic. Scarpa's fascia is closed with interrupted 3-0 absorbable suture, followed by a subcuticular closure or staples for the skin. In nonperforated appendicitis, the skin may be closed primarily with a low likelihood of wound infection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After either open or laparoscopic appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis, patients may be started on a clear liquid diet and advanced as tolerated to a regular diet. Antibiotics are not required postoperatively. Most patients are discharged within 24 to 48 hours of surgery. Same-day discharge is feasible, most commonly following a laparoscopic appendectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PERFORATED APPENDICITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with perforated appendicitis may appear acutely ill and have significant dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities, particularly if fever and vomiting have been present for a long time. The pain usually localizes to the right lower quadrant if the perforation has been walled off by surrounding intra-abdominal structures such as the omentum but can be diffuse if generalized peritonitis ensues. On imaging studies, appendicitis can present with a contained perforation (an inflammatory mass often referred to as a &quot;phlegmon,&quot; or an intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess) or, rarely, a free perforation. </p><p>Other unusual presentations of appendiceal perforation can occur, such as retroperitoneal abscess formation due to perforation of a retrocecal appendix or liver abscess formation due to hematogenous spread of infection through the portal venous system. An enterocutaneous fistula can result from an intraperitoneal abscess that fistulizes to the skin. Appendiceal perforation can result in a small bowel obstruction, manifested by bilious vomiting and obstipation. High fevers and jaundice can be seen with pylephlebitis (septic portal vein thrombosis) and can be confused with cholangitis.</p><p>Perforation is found in 13 to 20 percent of patients who present with acute appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Perforation rate is higher among men (18 percent men versus 13 percent women) and older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/21,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,68</a>]. Although perforation is a major concern when evaluating a patient with symptoms that have lasted more than 24 hours, the time course of progression of appendicitis to necrosis and perforation varies among patients, and perforation can develop more rapidly and should always be considered. Approximately 20 percent of patients with perforated appendicitis present within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>The management of perforated appendicitis depends on the condition of the patient (stable versus unstable), the nature of the perforation (contained versus free perforation), and whether an abscess or phlegmon is present on imaging studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F115333\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115333 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H579178234\"><span class=\"h2\">Unstable patients or patients with free perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A free perforation of the appendix can cause intraperitoneal dissemination of pus and fecal material and generalized peritonitis. These patients are typically quite ill and may be septic or hemodynamically unstable, thus requiring preoperative resuscitation. The diagnosis is not always appreciated before exploration. </p><p>For patients who are septic or unstable, and for those who have a free perforation of the appendix or generalized peritonitis, emergency appendectomy is required, as well as drainage and irrigation of the peritoneal cavity. Emergency appendectomy in this setting can be accomplished open or laparoscopically; the choice is determined by surgeon preference with consideration of patient condition and local resources. (See <a href=\"#H2870324538\" class=\"local\">'Appendectomy for perforated appendicitis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H361568357\"><span class=\"h2\">Stable patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stable patients with perforated appendicitis who have symptoms localized to the right lower quadrant can be treated with immediate appendectomy or initial nonoperative management. Both approaches are safe. A 2017 Cochrane review of two randomized trials concluded that the quality of the evidence was too low to make a recommendation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Thus, the decision ultimately rests with the treating surgeon. We suggest the following initial approach based on imaging findings on presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F115333\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115333 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an appendiceal abscess should be treated with intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous, image-guided drainage of the abscess. Immediate appendectomy is an alternative option for these patients, especially if the abscess is not amenable to percutaneous drainage. (See <a href=\"#H2870324538\" class=\"local\">'Appendectomy for perforated appendicitis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a phlegmon of the right lower quadrant should be treated with intravenous antibiotics. Repeat imaging is often performed to follow the resolution (or progression) of the phlegmon, and to exclude other complications that could evolve over time (eg, abscess formation). The authors of this topic do not perform immediate appendectomy in patients with a phlegmon associated with perforated appendicitis.</p><p/><p>Patients who fail initial antibiotic therapy clinically or radiographically require rescue appendectomy, whereas those who respond to initial antibiotic therapy can be discharged with oral antibiotics to complete a 7- to 10-day course (in total) and return for follow-up in six to eight weeks. (See <a href=\"#H2534765348\" class=\"local\">'Initial nonoperative management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2534765348\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial nonoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stable patients with perforated appendicitis who have symptoms localized to the right lower quadrant (ie, no free perforation or generalized peritonitis) should be treated initially with antibiotics, intravenous fluids, and bowel rest, rather than immediate surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. These patients will often have a palpable mass on physical examination; a computed tomography (CT) scan may reveal a phlegmon or abscess. </p><p>Immediate surgery in patients with a long duration of symptoms and phlegmon or abscess formation has been associated with increased morbidity, due to dense adhesions and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Under these circumstances, appendectomy often requires extensive dissection and may lead to injury of adjacent structures. Complications such as a postoperative abscess or enterocutaneous fistula may ensue, necessitating an ileocolectomy or cecectomy. Nonoperative management during the initial admission allows the local inflammation to subside; interval appendectomy, if elected, can be carried out at a lower risk. Fortunately, many of these patients will respond to initial nonoperative management since the appendiceal process has already been &quot;walled off.&quot; </p><p>A 2010 meta-analysis of 17 nonrandomized studies showed that, compared with immediate surgery, initial nonoperative management of perforated appendicitis with abscess or phlegmon is associated with fewer complications and similar length of stay and duration of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Although a small randomized trial published after the meta-analysis showed immediate laparoscopic appendectomy to be feasible for perforated appendicitis with abscess (median duration of symptom seven days) and resulted in fewer readmissions and fewer additional interventions than nonoperative management, substantial portions of patients who underwent immediate surgery required bowel resection (10 percent), required conversion to open surgery (10 percent), or had incomplete appendectomy (13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. </p><p>Initial nonoperative management includes intravenous antibiotics and fluids as well as bowel rest; any accessible abscess should be drained percutaneously under image guidance. Patients should be closely monitored in the hospital during this time. Treatment failure, as evidenced by bowel obstruction, sepsis, or persistent pain, fever, or leukocytosis, requires immediate rescue appendectomy. If fever, tenderness, and leukocytosis improve, diet can be slowly advanced, usually within three to five days. Patients are discharged home when clinical parameters have normalized and return for a follow-up in six to eight weeks.

The choice of agents is based on patient and disease factors (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults#H90328678\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial approach to intra-abdominal infections in adults&quot;, section on 'Regimens'</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most perforated appendices or appendiceal abscesses fall into the category of mild-to-moderate community-acquired intra-abdominal infections without risk factors for antibiotic resistance or treatment failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F105865\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105865 \">table 2</a>).

We also usually use an empiric regimen that has anti-enterococcal activity for patients with healthcare-associated intra-abdominal infection, particularly those with postoperative infection, those who have previously received cephalosporins or other antimicrobial agents selecting for <em>Enterococcus</em> species, immunocompromised patients, and those with valvular heart disease or prosthetic intravascular materials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F106950\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106950 \">table 5</a>).</p><p/><p>Regardless of the initial empiric regimen, the therapeutic regimen should be revisited once culture and susceptibility results are available.

Because of wound infection rates ranging from 30 to 50 percent with primary closure of grossly contaminated wounds, many advocate delayed primary or secondary closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. However, two meta-analyses showed that, compared with primary closure, delayed closure increased the length of hospital stay by 1.6 days without decreasing the wound infection rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. A cost-utility analysis of contaminated appendectomy wounds also showed primary closure to be the most cost-effective method of wound management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with a contaminated wound due to perforated appendicitis, we suggest against delayed wound closure. Our preferred technique of skin closure after an open appendectomy is interrupted permanent sutures or staples every 2 cm with loose wound packing in between. Removal of the packing in 48 hours often leaves an excellent cosmetic result with an acceptable incidence of wound infection. If heavy fecal contamination is present, the skin is often left open to close secondarily. Wounds are typically closed after a laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14896231\"><span class=\"h4\">Postoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with perforated appendicitis often develop an ileus postoperatively regardless of the surgical approach (open versus laparoscopic).
