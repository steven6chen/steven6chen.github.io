The term &quot;exercise-induced asthma&quot; is often used to describe episodic bronchoconstriction following exercise, but this wording is potentially misleading, since exercise is not an independent risk factor for asthma, but rather a trigger of bronchoconstriction in patients with underlying asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In fact, there is some speculation that decreased physical activity is a risk factor for asthma, and that exercise may be helpful in preventing the onset of asthma in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, the term exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is a more accurate reflection of the underlying pathophysiology, and is generally preferred.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction will be discussed here. The clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of asthma are reviewed separately.

In comparison, up to 90 percent of patients with symptomatic asthma have some degree of EIB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The magnitude of EIB is most strongly correlated with the underlying degree of airway hyperresponsiveness and the presence of airway inflammation, as measured by the number of airway eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Thus, many patients with mild, episodic asthma characterized by minimally increased airway responsiveness and mild airway inflammation do not experience clinically significant bronchoconstriction even with strenuous exercise.</p><p>The prevalence of EIB appears to be higher among elite athletes and has been evaluated in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/6,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9-12</a>]. As an example, in a study of athletes participating in the summer Beijing and Athens Olympic Games, the sports most commonly associated with a Therapeutic Use Exemption for asthma were swimming, cycling, triathlon, pentathlon, and rowing, with prevalences of approximately 18, 16, 12, 13, 7 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast, the prevalence of asthma among athletes in disciplines without endurance demands, such as gymnastics, fencing, and sailing, was less than 5 percent. In a separate study, positive eucapnic hyperventilation was noted in 39 percent of swimmers and 24 percent of winter sport athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minute ventilation, the volume of air inhaled or exhaled from a person's lungs per minute, rises with exercise. EIB probably results from changes in airway physiology triggered by the large volume of relatively cool, dry air inhaled during vigorous activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. This is supported by the finding that EIB is attenuated when the inspired gas is more fully humidified and closer to body temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The effect of large-volume dry air inhalation on airway surface osmolality may be the primary stimulus responsible for bronchoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other relevant observations regarding EIB include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levels of bronchoconstrictive and inflammatory mediators are increased, particularly leukotrienes LTC4 and LTD4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], histamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and interleukin (IL)-8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

These changes favor production of IgE and activation of eosinophils.

The initial bronchodilation is followed by <strong>bronchoconstriction</strong>, which begins by three minutes after exercise, generally peaks within 10 to 15 minutes, and resolves by 60 minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64910 \">figure 1</a>). Typical symptoms are shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough. Associated hoarseness or stridor is uncommon and should raise the possibility of paradoxical vocal fold motion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paradoxical vocal fold motion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most patients with EIB, bronchoconstriction is followed by a refractory period, during which repeated exertion causes less bronchoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This refractory period is generally less than four hours. Inhibitory prostaglandins (particularly prostaglandin E2) released during the refractory period probably protect against repeated episodes of EIB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78975\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78975 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Acute bronchoconstriction was previously believed to be followed by late phase bronchoconstriction in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Findings in subsequent studies have been variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]; however, it does appear that the risk and severity of late phase bronchoconstriction due to EIB is substantially less than that associated with allergen-induced asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Among atopic asthma patients with sensitization to inhalant allergens, EIB may be more likely to occur when the exercise includes exposure to the relevant allergen. As an example, runners are more likely to report exercise-related asthma symptoms during their pollen or mold allergy season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is based on the combination of compatible clinical symptoms (eg, exercise-related symptoms of dyspnea, cough, or wheeze) and demonstration of reversible airflow limitation in response to exercise or a surrogate challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/6,29,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29,39</a>]. In patients with well-documented asthma and typical asthma symptoms following exercise, formal exercise testing may not be needed unless symptoms do not resolve with, or are not prevented by, pretreatment with inhaled beta agonists. </p><p>In patients without documented asthma, further assessment is helpful to ensure that alternative causes of dyspnea are not overlooked and that unnecessary therapy is not prescribed. This is particularly true when an adult develops new onset exercise related symptoms. Formal testing is also helpful in evaluating highly trained athletes, as exercise related respiratory symptoms are poor predictors of EIB in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/6,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,40-42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise challenge</strong> &ndash; An exercise challenge test is the most direct and preferred way to establish a diagnosis of EIB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This usually involves 6 to 10 minutes of ergometer or treadmill exercise, sufficient to raise the heart rate to 80 to 90 percent of the predicted maximum. A test is generally considered positive if the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) decreases by 10 percent or more, although a fall of 15 percent is more diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/6,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchoprovocation-testing#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchoprovocation testing&quot;, section on 'Exercise challenge'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surrogate provocation tests</strong> &ndash; Alternatively, surrogate tests to assess bronchial hyperresponsiveness (eg, eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, histamine, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> inhalation challenge) may be performed in specialized laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Depending on the available facilities, a surrogate test can be used instead of an exercise challenge test. Or, if the direct test is negative, an indirect test may identify patients with EIB who have a false negative exercise test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Among the surrogate tests, eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation appears to have the greatest sensitivity for EIB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

After a baseline value has been established, FEV<sub>1</sub> can be measured before and 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes after exercise and correlated with symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other causes of exercise-induced dyspnea must be considered in the differential diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), particularly in patients who have no other manifestations of asthma, have normal baseline spirometry, and derive no benefit from pretreatment with bronchodilators. Central airway obstruction, paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM), laryngomalacia, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, interstitial lung disease, gastroesophageal reflux, poor cardiovascular conditioning, coronary heart disease, and exercise-induced dysrhythmias should be considered in adults who present with atypical exercise-induced dyspnea. A general approach to the diagnosis of dyspnea and wheezing illnesses are provided separately.

Diagnosis may require direct visualization or a high index of suspicion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central airway obstruction</strong> &ndash; Features that suggest central airway obstruction include a lack of response to inhaled bronchodilator, associated hemoptysis, and risk factors for lung cancer or metastasis to the airway.

However, a portion of patients have expiratory stridor due to expiratory adduction of the vocal folds. PVFM is often brought on by exercise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paradoxical vocal fold motion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise-induced laryngomalacia</strong> &ndash; Exercise-induced laryngomalacia is associated with inspiratory stridor during exercise caused by abnormal movement of the aryepiglottic folds into the endolarynx, resulting in subtotal glottic obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>]. It is distinct from tracheomalacia. The diagnosis is made by flexible laryngoscopy during exercise. Exercise-induced laryngomalacia and PVFM are both forms of exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paradoxical vocal fold motion&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise-induced anaphylaxis</strong> &ndash; Exercise-induced anaphylaxis is characterized by the abrupt onset of signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis during exercise. Prodromal symptoms may include generalized pruritus, warmth, urticaria, and fatigue. A food co-factor may be implicated. Some patients develop laryngeal angioedema as a component, although hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiovascular collapse are more common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise-associated reflux</strong> &ndash; Laryngopharyngeal reflux during exercise can mimic mild symptoms of EIB and exercise-induced anaphylaxis, including flushing, throat discomfort, dysphonia, and chest <span class=\"nowrap\">tightness/cough</span>. However, it is not associated with severe dyspnea, pruritus, or urticaria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laryngopharyngeal-reflux#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laryngopharyngeal reflux&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The differential diagnosis of EIB is similar among children. In one retrospective review, treadmill exercise testing was performed in 142 children referred to a pediatric allergy and pulmonology clinic with exercise-induced dyspnea who had no other signs of asthma or in whom treatment with beta-2-agonists had failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Symptoms of exercise-induced dyspnea were reproduced in 82 percent. Among these 117 children, only 11 (9 percent) had EIB (defined by reproduction of symptoms and &ge;15 percent decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> from baseline). Other diagnoses included normal physiologic exercise limitation (63 percent), restrictive abnormalities (13 percent), vocal cord dysfunction (11 percent); laryngomalacia (2 percent), and hyperventilation and supraventricular tachycardia, each in one patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combination of general measures and pharmacologic intervention can prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in almost all patients. A major goal is to <strong>ensure that exercise is not avoided</strong> by patients with EIB. Asthmatics should exercise as much as desired, and should be encouraged by the fact that athletes have won Olympic medals and played professional sports, in spite of symptomatic asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4091103272\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Response to therapy can be assessed subjectively in terms of symptom control and exercise tolerance. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement before and after exercise may be helpful, although measurements of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) are more reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. If objective measurement of a patient's response to therapy is required, a formal exercise test, rather than the more widely available <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> challenge, should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].

Should the athlete continue to experience a reduction in PEF or frequent EIB, a medical evaluation for medication adjustment would likely be indicated.

These measures are based upon observed relationships between the severity of bronchoconstriction and the following factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The magnitude of minute ventilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The temperature and humidity of the inspired air</p><p/><p>Improving a patient's cardiovascular fitness reduces the minute ventilation required for a given level of exercise, thereby decreasing the stimulus for bronchoconstriction. Similarly, bronchoconstriction is lessened when the inspired gas is warmer and more humid. Patients should be instructed to breathe through a loosely fitting scarf or mask when exercising in cold, dry conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. </p><p>The role of a pre-exercise warm-up is unclear. Some studies suggest that high intensity and variable intensity warm-up routines attenuate the fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), but data are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/45,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,56,57</a>]. Finally, ensuring that patients know when and how to use a metered dose or dry powder inhaler correctly can greatly enhance the efficacy of pharmacologic measures.</p><p>The role of controlling adverse environments in reducing symptoms of EIB has not been formally studied, although it seems reasonable to reduce chloramines in indoor pool environments, use a heat-exchanger or other face mask during cold weather endurance exercise, and, for urban athletes, schedule outdoor training around low-traffic hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/29,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of EIB has been studied primarily in patients with both EIB <strong>and</strong> underlying asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Therapeutic options for patients with EIB as the <strong>only</strong> manifestation of airway hyperresponsiveness are less well researched. In general, if EIB occurs frequently in patients with poorly controlled asthma, the most important strategy is to improve overall asthma control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/29,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,59</a>]. Inhaled glucocorticoids and leukotriene-modifying agents are often useful in this regard.

Two puffs are generally sufficient; occasionally four puffs are needed. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ipratropium</a> is generally <strong>not</strong> used for quick relief as bronchodilation is delayed (onset at 15 minutes and peak at 1 to 2 hours) compared with SABAs. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cromolyn</a> sodium is <strong>not</strong> effective for quick relief. </p><p>In addition, patients who have well-controlled asthma, but frequently have asthma symptoms with exercise, should be instructed to use prophylactic treatment approximately 5 to 15 minutes before exercise, usually with two puffs of a SABA (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levalbuterol</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/29,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,60,61</a>]. Patients with more severe EIB may require higher prophylactic doses of the inhaled SABA (eg, four puffs). Equipotent doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">formoterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> appear to be equally effective in providing short-term control of EIB, although the onset of action is slower with salmeterol than with the other agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72467 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, frequent use of inhaled beta-agonists may lead to tolerance and decreased efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Thus, it is preferable for athletes who exercise regularly to aim for sufficient control of their asthma that beta-agonist pretreatment is not routinely needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

In this setting, it might be tempting to add a long-acting inhaled beta-2 agonist (LABA; such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">formoterol</a>) to provide protection against EIB for 12 or more hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. However, regular use of LABAs or SABAs run the risk of tachyphylaxis and LABAs are not recommended for monotherapy in asthma. LABAs and SABAs used frequently provide less effective protection against EIB than intermittent prophylactic use of SABAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/63,66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,66-69</a>]. Alternative strategies are described below.

One might imagine that an inhaled LABA might be useful in this situation. However, in concert with current guidelines, we do not recommend regular use of LABAs (ie, once or twice daily) as monotherapy for EIB, because of concerns about a loss of bronchoprotective effect over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/29,66,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,66,70</a>]. Thus, for patients who would require regular, daily dosing of a SABA or LABA to control EIB, we recommend concomitant use of inhaled glucocorticoid or a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zafirlukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zafirlukast</a>).

While not effective in all patients, LTRAs appear superior to LABAs when treating asthmatics with EIB. In one multicenter trial, asthmatics with EIB were randomly assigned to either montelukast or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a> for eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Therapy was protective within three days for both groups; however, tolerance to salmeterol developed, and by eight weeks, the bronchoprotective effect of montelukast was significantly better (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69196\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69196 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>As mentioned above, children with EIB can pose a therapeutic challenge, because they tend to exercise intermittently throughout the day and often neglect to premedicate with an inhaled SABA. LTRAs are an effective option in this setting. In a randomized trial of EIB in children, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a> and montelukast with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> were superior to budesonide and budesonide with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">formoterol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Improving asthma control to the point that specific pretreatment is not necessary before exercise is an additional strategy. This goal can often be accomplished with use of inhaled glucocorticoids according to current guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-induced-bronchoconstriction/abstract/29,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,59</a>].

The term EIB reflects the view that exercise is a trigger of bronchoconstriction in patients with underlying asthma. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improving a patient's cardiovascular fitness reduces the minute ventilation required for a given level of exercise, thereby decreasing the stimulus for bronchoconstriction. Avoiding exercise in cold, dry air can also reduce the stimulus for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic measures to reduce EIB'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy of EIB varies somewhat with the clinical setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105874 \">table 1</a>). The first priority in patients with uncontrolled asthma is to step up treatment to achieve control of asthma. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Selection of pharmacologic therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with asthma should have a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) available when exercising for relief of asthma symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic measures to reduce EIB'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have well-controlled asthma, but who frequently have asthma symptoms with exercise, we recommend prophylactic use of a SABA approximately 10 to 15 minutes prior to exercise (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Alternatives for prophylaxis in patients who prefer not to use a SABA include leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a>, or a cromoglycate (where available). However, none of these alternatives reverse bronchoconstriction as rapidly as a SABA, so the patient will still need to keep a SABA on hand for break-through symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Quick relief and preventive treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a patient has EIB symptoms despite use of a SABA, we suggest adding regular therapy with an inhaled glucocorticoid or a LTRA, rather than using monotherapy with a long-acting beta agonist (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In this setting, poor control of underlying asthma may be contributing to the exercise-related respiratory symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Quick relief and preventive treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nedocromil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nedocromil</a> (two to four puffs, 15 to 20 minutes before exercise) have limited availability, but where available, they may be used for prophylaxis. For athletes engaging in particularly strenuous exercise or exercising in extreme conditions, inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> or a cromoglycate in combination with an inhaled SABA may be beneficial, although supportive data are limited. (See <a href=\"#H1578939415\" class=\"local\">'Intolerance of short-acting beta agonists'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1439411521\" class=\"local\">'Prolonged or recurrent exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require daily therapy for EIB, we suggest regular use of a LTRA or an inhaled glucocorticoid, rather than regular daily use of a beta agonist alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Quick relief and preventive treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When exercise is unpredictable or repeated during the day (eg, in children), we suggest a daily dosing of a LTRA rather than a pre-exercise inhaler (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1439411521\" class=\"local\">'Prolonged or recurrent exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antihistamines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> and oral beta agonists are minimally effective or ineffective for EIB.
