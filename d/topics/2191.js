The choice of treatment is determined by a variety of factors, including patient preference, clinician judgment, and resource availability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer#H834319\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Choice of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Brachytherapy, involves the permanent or temporary placement of radioactive sources that are implanted directly into the prostate gland to administer a high dose of radiation directly to the prostate while minimizing radiation to normal tissues. Observational data indicate that, as monotherapy, brachytherapy has similar efficacy compared with other forms of radiation and is comparable with other modalities (eg, surgery) in the treatment of low-risk prostate cancer, and it has an important role in combination with external beam RT in the management of some patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease. In combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and external beam RT, permanent prostate implants appear to render higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) control than dose-escalated external beam RT and ADT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The techniques and complications of brachytherapy, along with relevant aspects of patient selection, are reviewed here. The stratification of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer based upon their risk of local recurrence or dissemination, and the application of these techniques to men with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer are discussed separately. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-risk-stratification-and-choice-of-initial-treatment#H11494930\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate cancer: Risk stratification and choice of initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Risk stratification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-approach-to-low-and-very-low-risk-clinically-localized-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial approach to low- and very low-risk clinically localized prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-regionally-localized-intermediate-high-and-very-high-risk-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of regionally localized intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brachytherapy allows a higher dose of radiation to be given to the target area while minimizing radiation exposure to the surrounding normal tissues.</p><p>Brachytherapy is more convenient than external beam radiation therapy (RT). While conventional external beam RT requires seven to eight weeks of treatments five times per week, brachytherapy using permanent prostate implantation (PPI) of either low dose rate (LDR) or high dose rate (HDR) seeds can be completed in a single outpatient visit. When combined with external beam RT, LDR brachytherapy, or HDR implants, the course of treatment can be shortened compared with a course of dose-escalated external beam RT alone. </p><p>The greatest deterrent to more widespread use of brachytherapy is the limited number of practitioners who are skilled at performing these procedures. Other potential drawbacks of brachytherapy include the risk for severe toxicity to the bladder, urethra, and rectum, because of their anatomic proximity to the prostate, and the high dose intensity close to the radiation source when not properly performed. Furthermore, the rapid drop-off in radiation dose can lead to undertreatment if the tumor has spread beyond the planned area of treatment. Usually, brachytherapy is combined with external beam RT in patients with or at high risk for extraprostatic spread who are thought to be at increased risk of recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During brachytherapy, the radiation sources are positioned within the prostate using a transperineal approach under imaging guidance (typically transrectal ultrasound) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Prostate brachytherapy is usually performed under light general or spinal anesthesia.</p><p>The radiation is delivered either with permanent low dose rate (LDR) radioactive sources (seeds) or by the placement of temporary high dose rate (HDR) sources into hollow catheters or needles that have been positioned in the prostate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Low dose rate brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on the size of the gland, approximately 75 to 125 radioactive seeds (each approximately 5 mm in length) are permanently implanted into the prostate gland according to a computerized treatment plan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F98923\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98923 \">image 1</a>). The old retropubic technique relied on freehand placement of the radiation sources. That approach was abandoned 30 years ago in favor of ultrasound-guided procedures that usually rely on a perineal template to ensure more precise placement of sources and better, more homogeneous dose distributions.</p><p>The planned radiation therapy (RT) dose is emitted over several months, depending upon the specific isotope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Both iodine-125 (I-125) and palladium-103 (Pd-103) are widely used; the available data do not indicate that one isotope is more effective than the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. Cesium-131 (CS-131) has also been used and has the shortest half-life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">High dose rate brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For HDR brachytherapy, transperineal catheters are inserted into the prostate, usually through a template that is fixed to the perineum. The hollow guides are then loaded with an isotope such as iridium-192 (Ir-192). Treatment planning is performed using computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound data sets. The dwell position of the sources within the catheters can be altered over time to optimize the resultant dose distribution. The HDR brachytherapy dose is usually administered in one to four large-dose fractions over a period of time, typically 24 to 40 hours. Patients receiving more than one fraction are usually admitted to the hospital (typically a 23-hour &quot;outpatient stay&quot;) for treatment when delivering multiple fractions, and they retain the perineal catheters in place for the entire period.</p><p>The main advantage of HDR brachytherapy is that the maximal dose rate is approximately 1000-fold higher than that achieved with LDR brachytherapy and approximates that delivered by a linear accelerator. Because the rapid drop-off in radiation dose at the edge of the gland can lead to underdosing of the periprostatic tissues, treatment is frequently combined with external beam RT in patients with high-risk disease. Although some studies suggest slightly lower genitourinary morbidity with HDR compared with LDR, most studies do not support a clear advantage of one form over the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selection of brachytherapy for a patient with localized prostate cancer is based upon technical feasibility, the absence of coexistent urinary conditions, the ability of the implant to encompass areas of known disease, and clinician or patient preference. Brachytherapy is commonly performed under general anesthesia, but it can be performed under spinal anesthesia in men who are unable to undergo anesthesia. However, local anesthesia has been used successfully at a limited number of institutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">LDR brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines from the American Brachytherapy Society (ABS) recommend that low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy used alone is an appropriate option for men with low-risk prostate cancer (clinical stage &le;T2a, biopsy histologic grade group 1 [Gleason score &le;6], and serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA] &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Brachytherapy alone is also an option for some patients with intermediate-risk disease when there are only limited features suggesting an increased risk, such as a serum PSA between 10 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or a small-volume Gleason score 7, preferably with a primary and dominant pattern Gleason grade of 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>LDR brachytherapy may also be appropriate in other patients with intermediate-risk disease and in those with high-risk disease when used in combination with external beam radiation therapy (RT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> androgen deprivation therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F100373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100373 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H674549074\"><span class=\"h2\">HDR brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines from ABS and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend that high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy be considered as a way to escalate the dose of radiation in men receiving RT as their primary therapy for prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

In addition, an excessively large prostate gland may prevent proper needle placement due to pubic arch interference or may result in inadequate coverage with the radiation. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>A brief course of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) prior to brachytherapy may reduce the volume of the prostate, thereby making brachytherapy feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Treatment for an average of three months with ADT generally decreases the size of the prostate by approximately 30 percent with an acceptable level of toxicity.

External beam radiation therapy (RT) was not used in conjunction with brachytherapy.</p><p>The median follow-up was 57 months (minimum 34 months).

After the acute exacerbation, symptoms gradually resolved. The IPSS returned to baseline levels in approximately 85 percent of cases, although this required two or more years in some cases.</p><p>On multivariate analysis, factors associated with increased late toxicity included more prostate symptoms at baseline (ie, a higher IPSS), the development of significant acute toxicity, and a larger prostate volume.

This was illustrated by a series in which 21 of 655 patients (3 percent) required catheterization in the immediate posttreatment period. An increased prostate volume and more severe pretreatment urinary symptoms were associated with an increased risk of acute urinary retention.</p><p>Although ADT can be used to reduce the volume of the prostate gland, this approach does not appear to decrease the risk of urinary morbidity. In a retrospective series, 81 patients who had been treated with ADT to reduce the size of their prostate gland were compared with matched controls with similar size prostates who had not required ADT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

A negative colonoscopy facilitates conservative management of rectal bleeding during the first two years after brachytherapy if symptoms are consistent with radiation proctitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98602599\"><span class=\"h2\">Rectal fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation-related rectal fistulas are a serious but rare complication, occurring in less than 1 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The development of a rectal fistula has not been correlated with clinical or dosimetric factors. Such fistulas may be more frequent when patients have undergone a biopsy or other invasive procedures, and such interventions should be avoided whenever possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of erectile dysfunction varies widely among men who were potent prior to brachytherapy, depending in part upon whether data are clinician or patient reported. Rates of erectile dysfunction are similar to that seen with external beam RT. In contrast to radical prostatectomy, the onset of erectile dysfunction is gradual following brachytherapy.</p><p>The frequency of impotence depends upon multiple factors. A validated model has been developed to help predict the probability of erectile function two years after brachytherapy; significant factors include patient age, ethnicity (African-American versus white or other), body mass index (BMI), and pretreatment sexual health-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>The impact of LDR brachytherapy on erectile function is illustrated by results from a prospective multicenter analysis of prostate cancer survivors that included 306 patients who were treated with LDR brachytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In this study, poor sexual function was reported in 43 to 48 percent of patients from 2 to 24 months after therapy. Approximately one-third of patients considered sexual dysfunction a moderate or big problem. Similar rates of dysfunction have been reported in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachytherapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. </p><p>The management of erectile dysfunction following brachytherapy is discussed separately.

The series included 306 patients who had been treated with brachytherapy, of whom 11 percent also were treated with external beam RT.</p><p>Factors negatively impacting quality of life following prostate brachytherapy included a significant worsening in urinary symptoms (irritation, incontinence, obstruction) in 18 percent of patients at one year after treatment. Bowel symptoms (urgency, frequency, pain, fecal incontinence, bleeding) were present in 9 percent after one year. Patients reported distress or dysfunction related to overall sexual function in 29 percent of cases at one year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Second malignancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second cancers, particularly of the bladder or rectum, are a theoretical concern in patients who undergo RT for prostate cancer. Although both external beam RT and brachytherapy may be associated with a small increase in the incidence of cancer, the risk of dying from a secondary malignancy at 10 to 15 years is very small and appears to be of similar magnitude to the perioperative mortality associated with radical prostatectomy.
