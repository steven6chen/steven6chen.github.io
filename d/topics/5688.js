In some patients, a clinical syndrome with features similar to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may develop, which is termed drug-induced lupus. As examples, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies often cause increased levels of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in serum, yet few patients with these antibodies develop clinical symptoms such as rash, serositis, or arthritis suggesting drug-induced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Drug-induced lupus has similarities to spontaneous SLE, but there are some differences in clinical and immunologic features and in the frequency of such features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69467 \">table 1</a>).

There are an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 cases of drug-induced lupus per year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is generally equally common in males and females, and more common in older people and white populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. An exception is minocycline-induced lupus, which is mostly observed in young women treated for acne.</p><p>The risk for developing drug-induced lupus varies substantially between different medications, ranging from 15 to 20 percent of those taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, and 7 to 13 percent of those taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>, to as low as 2 per 1000 for those taking anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent, and 5 per 10,000 of those taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the relative incidence of drug-induced lupus from each of these agents will depend upon the extent to which they are prescribed; thus, procainamide- and hydralazine-induced lupus are relatively uncommon in clinical practice, given the infrequent use of these medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism or mechanisms involved in drug-induced lupus remain uncertain. However, various theories have been developed regarding the pathogenesis of drug-induced lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Inherited differences in drug metabolism (eg, acetylator status) and immunogenetic characteristics are genetic factors that may influence the risk of developing disease. Potential disease mechanisms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities in oxidative drug metabolism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs acting as haptens or agonists for drug-specific T cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytotoxic drug metabolites causing pathology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs nonspecifically activating lymphocytes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug metabolites disrupting central immune tolerance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities in thymus function</p><p/><p>Multiple risk factors may be involved for a given agent. As an example, risk factors for hydralazine-induced lupus include drug dose (especially doses greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a cumulative dose of more than 100 g); female sex; slow hepatic acetylation; and immunogenetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H36083008\" class=\"local\">'Immunogenetics'</a> below.)</p><p>Regardless of the mechanism, the result has the hallmarks of enhanced autoimmunity, and the clinical manifestations result from immune-mediated effects upon the target organs. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>There are several ways in which drugs may potentially influence lupus: they might exacerbate underlying lupus or induce lupus in a predisposed patient, or they might cause the separate syndrome of drug-induced lupus. Evidence is lacking to support the historical view that penicillin and anticonvulsant drugs might exacerbate underlying lupus. However, some studies have suggested that sulfonamide antibiotics might exacerbate lupus; one study found an increased frequency of allergy to sulfonamides in patients with lupus compared with the general population, and an increased risk of pericarditis in African-American patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a history of sulfa allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Sulfa drugs, including sulfonamide antibiotics and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, are both considered among the drugs that can probably cause drug-induced lupus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1339498\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the pathogenesis of drug-induced lupus is not well understood, genetic predisposition may play a role. For certain drugs, genetically determined effects upon drug metabolism are clearly important (see <a href=\"#H1339415\" class=\"local\">'Acetylator status'</a> below). Immunogenetic characteristics and other factors may also play a role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36083008\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunogenetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Possible genetic risk factors include human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4, HLA-DR0301, and the complement C4 null allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/3,7,8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8,10</a>]. These factors vary between different agents. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunogenetic risk factors for procainamide-induced lupus, which occurs more readily in slow acetylators, may include HLA-DR6Y, but not DR4 or DR3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for hydralazine-induced lupus include female sex; slow hepatic acetylation; the HLA-DR4 genotype; and the null gene for the fourth component of complement, C4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. In one study, lupus developed in 19 percent of women taking 200 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> daily, compared with 13 of 13 women who also had the HLA-DR4 genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These factors may interact; it is possible that slow acetylation increases free drug levels, while low levels of C4 might prevent clearance of any immune complexes that are formed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with HLA-DQB1 and either HLA-DR2 or HLA-DR4 may be at increased risk of developing minocycline-induced lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1339415\"><span class=\"h3\">Acetylator status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug-induced lupus is more likely to develop and develops sooner with certain drugs metabolized by acetylation in those patients who are slow acetylators, ie, those in whom there is a genetically-mediated decrease in the hepatic synthesis of N-acetyltransferase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Examples of such drugs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Causative drugs'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast to the high degree of risk for drug-induced lupus with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, particularly in slow acetylators, there is little or no antinuclear antibodies (ANA) formation or symptomatic lupus following the administration of N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA), the major active metabolite of procainamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]; furthermore, remission of procainamide-induced lupus can be achieved by switching to NAPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These observations suggest an important pathogenetic role for the aromatic amino group on procainamide. (See <a href=\"#H3404030\" class=\"local\">'Systemic drug-induced lupus'</a> below.)</p><p>In comparison, acetylation rate is not a risk factor for spontaneous lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Acetylation rate also seems unlikely to be related to the etiopathogenesis of disease related to other agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> and the tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important immunologic characteristic of drug-induced lupus is the presence of autoantibodies. The autoantibodies or patterns of autoantibodies that are seen largely depend upon the inciting agent. As examples, in disease related to certain drugs, there are antinuclear antibodies that have specificity for histone proteins, while, with disease due to other agents, antibodies that are more often associated with idiopathic SLE (eg, anti-double stranded [ds]DNA antibodies) or with systemic vasculitis (eg, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-histone antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-histone antibodies are present in more than 95 percent of patients overall, among those taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>; however, anti-histone antibodies have been found in a smaller proportion of patients with drug-induced lupus associated with other medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a>, and statins (32, 42, and &lt;50 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Other autoantibodies are uncommon in this disorder. Importantly, anti-histone antibodies are also seen in up to 80 percent of patients with idiopathic lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]; however, patients with idiopathic SLE also form a variety of other autoantibodies, including those directed against DNA and small ribonucleoproteins, which are less common in drug-induced lupus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69467 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The anti-histone antibodies in drug-induced lupus are primarily formed against a complex of the histone dimer H2A-H2B and DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>] and, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>, to the H1 and H3-H4 complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. DNA is required either to stabilize the complex or perhaps to contribute part of the antigenic epitope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although the drugs that can cause drug-induced lupus are markedly heterogeneous, there may be a common pathway for disease induction since the antihistone autoantibodies produced in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, hydralazine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acebutolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acebutolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a> are nearly identical in most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], but not all, patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In contrast, the anti-histone antibodies in idiopathic lupus are primarily directed against the H1 and H2B histone subunits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The development of IgG antibodies to the complex of H2A-H2B and DNA soon after starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> is associated with a high risk of developing drug-induced lupus; by comparison, autoantibodies to single-stranded DNA or to histones alone do not distinguish between symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It is not known if these observations apply to other causes of drug-induced lupus.</p><p>It remains unclear what the particular characteristic is of those drugs that induce autoantibody formation. One possibility is that the offending drugs can serve as substrates for myeloperoxidase in activated neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This has been demonstrated in vitro with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>, and to a lesser extent with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpromazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpromazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propylthiouracil</a>. This interaction results in the formation of reactive drug metabolites, which may directly affect lymphocyte function.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis is that drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> decrease T cell DNA methylation, leading to overexpression of LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/19,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26,27</a>]. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation in an animal model of drug-induced lupus that hydralazine acts by inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, with resulting interference with DNA methyltransferase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The T cells with hypomethylated DNA may then become autoreactive, leading to autoantibody formation. Ultraviolet light has the same effect, which may explain its ability to induce exacerbations of idiopathic lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It is also possible that genetic differences in cytochrome P450 enzymes, which facilitate the metabolism of many medications, result in the generation of toxic metabolites that facilitate the development of autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Based upon in vitro and in vivo murine studies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> hydroxylamine (PAHA, a reactive metabolite of procainamide) has been implicated in the development of drug-induced lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. As an example, in one such study antibodies to the histone (H2A-H2B)-DNA complex were induced in mice by the intrathymic injection of PAHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In another study, the incubation of murine T cell clones with PAHA resulted in resistance to anergy induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Taken together, these observations suggest that PAHA induces autoimmunity via the emergence of autoreactive T cells followed by the production of anti-histone antibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-double stranded DNA antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-dsDNA antibodies are typically absent in drug-induced lupus due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, but these antibodies are associated with drug-induced disease with other agents, particularly with interferon-alpha and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents. With the latter class of anticytokine therapies, although the majority of patients may eventually develop antinuclear antibodies and other autoantibodies, including anti-dsDNA antibodies, relatively few patients with any of these antibodies develop clinical manifestations of drug-induced lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

A positive test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) can be present in patients who have been treated with certain agents (see <a href=\"#H25754200\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above). Anti-histone antibodies are strongly associated with some forms of drug-induced lupus (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Anti-histone antibodies'</a> above). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are not found in most forms of drug-induced lupus.

The ANA often persist for a greater duration than the symptoms and physical findings, and in some patients autoantibodies may persist for a year or longer.</p><p/><p>The diagnosis of drug-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) can be made in patients with clinical findings characteristic of idiopathic SCLE that have developed in association with exposure to a medication known to cause this disorder, typically one to five months after initiating therapy, in whom the cutaneous changes and other associated findings resolve after discontinuation of the suspected offending agent. The presence of more widespread involvement than is typical of idiopathic SCLE should heighten suspicion of drug-induced SCLE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21622846\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of drug-induced lupus is broad; it includes the idiopathic (ie, spontaneous) forms of the diseases and depends further upon the clinical manifestations that are present. It is thus highly similar to the differential diagnosis in patients suspected of idiopathic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The differential diagnosis of subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE) includes other skin disorders with an annular or <span class=\"nowrap\">psoriasiform/papulosquamous</span> morphology as well as a number of photo-distributed dermatoses. These differential diagnoses are discussed in detail separately.

Features more suggestive of idiopathic SLE, and which are much less common in drug-induced lupus, include renal, neurologic, cutaneous, and severe hematologic involvement. Antihistone antibodies may be seen in both idiopathic and drug-induced lupus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Idiopathic SCLE</strong> &ndash; Several features are much more common in drug-induced than idiopathic SCLE, although the clinical findings are not unique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The cutaneous eruption in patients with drug-induced SCLE is frequently widespread in its distribution, which is uncommon in idiopathic SCLE. It is more likely to have bullous features and a vasculitic component. Additionally, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA</span> antibodies are present in a high proportion of patients, but will disappear after resolution of the skin disease in about three-quarters of the patients<strong> </strong>in whom they are present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial step in treatment is to stop the offending medication. Specific manifestations should then be treated temporarily until they resolve using the same approaches used in patients with idiopathic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Treatment is based upon the observations of the authors and other experts that symptoms gradually resolve after drug discontinuation in most patients (see <a href=\"#H21622825\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below), and that medications that are effective in idiopathic SLE and subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE) are also effective in patients with drug-induced illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-lupus/abstract/2,20,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20,78</a>]. As examples, we treat arthralgia, arthritis, and serositis initially with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and cutaneous eruptions are treated with topical therapies, including topical corticosteroids. Drug-induced SCLE is also treated using the same approach as the idiopathic form of the disease following discontinuation of the offending agent.

Most commonly, these drugs induce autoantibodies without causing a clinical disorder. Drug-induced lupus has similarities to spontaneous (idiopathic) systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but there are some differences in clinical and immunologic features and in the frequency of such features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69467 \">table 1</a>). The demographic characteristics of drug-induced lupus largely depend upon the populations most likely to receive the relevant drug, and the risk for developing drug-induced lupus varies substantially between different medications. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanisms of disease involved in drug-induced lupus remain uncertain and differ between the causal agents and classes of medications. Patient characteristics that influence risk, depending upon the offending agent, include genetically determined effects upon drug metabolism, particularly whether or not a patient is a slow acetylator (with decreased hepatic synthesis of N-acetyltransferase), and immunogenetic characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36083008\" class=\"local\">'Immunogenetics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1339415\" class=\"local\">'Acetylator status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The autoantibodies or patterns of autoantibodies that are seen largely depend upon the inciting agent, but for certain drugs may include antinuclear antibodies that have specificity for histone proteins, while with disease due to other drugs, antibodies that are more often associated with idiopathic SLE (eg, anti-double stranded [ds]DNA antibodies) or with systemic vasculitis (eg, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) may be present. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Autoantibodies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs associated with the highest risk of inducing lupus in an individual patient are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a>.

A variety of agents have been implicated as probable or possible, but not definite, causes of drug-induced lupus, including anticonvulsants, antithyroid drugs, antimicrobials, and others. (See <a href=\"#H9136359\" class=\"local\">'Overview of causative drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with drug-induced lupus can develop a variety of systemic manifestations. The most common include fever, myalgias, arthralgias, arthritis, and serositis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69467 \">table 1</a>). The frequency of these manifestations may vary with the drug. Hematologic abnormalities and more severe manifestations, such as kidney disease and central nervous system involvement, are uncommon, although they may occur. Liver function abnormalities have been noted, especially in patients with minocycline-induced lupus. Cutaneous manifestations are much less common in drug-induced (systemic) lupus compared with idiopathic systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), although subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) is often drug-induced.

The majority of patients with drug-induced SCLE are <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-Ro/SSA-positive</span>. Drug-induced SCLE typically presents as an annular or psoriasiform, photo-distributed cutaneous eruption. Medications most often associated with SCLE include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, anti-TNF-alpha therapies, and proton-pump inhibitors.

At least one feature typical of SLE should be present, but patients with drug-induced lupus often do not exhibit a sufficient number of manifestations to satisfy criteria for idiopathic SLE. The diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected drug-induced lupus should be similar to that performed in patients suspected of idiopathic SLE. Confirming the diagnosis is difficult, however, because of the clinical overlap with the more common idiopathic disease. The &quot;gold standard&quot; is spontaneous resolution of the clinical manifestations of the disease, typically within several weeks to months after the offending drug has been discontinued.
