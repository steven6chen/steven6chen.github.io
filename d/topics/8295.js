The pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells required for this procedure are usually obtained from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of a related or unrelated donor. Historically, the best results of allogeneic HCT have been obtained when the stem cell donor is a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling. </p><p>Given the small family sizes in developed nations and the 25 percent likelihood that any sibling is fully HLA-matched to the patient, an HLA-matched sibling can be found for only approximately 30 percent of patients. For patients who lack an HLA-matched sibling, alternative sources of donor grafts include suitably HLA-matched adult unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood stem cells, and partially HLA-mismatched, or HLA-haploidentical, related donors. Substantial improvements in haploidentical transplantations have occurred in the last decade and there is growing use of haploidentical family donors. The decision of which donor source to utilize depends, to a large degree, upon the clinical situation and the approaches employed at the individual transplant center. </p><p>The major challenge of HLA-haploidentical HCT is intense bi-directional alloreactivity leading to high incidences of graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Advances in graft engineering and in pharmacologic prophylaxis of GVHD have reduced the risks of graft failure and GVHD after HLA-haploidentical HCT, and have made this stem cell source a viable alternative for patients lacking an HLA-matched sibling.</p><p>This topic will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of HLA-haploidentical HCT and the selection of an HLA-haploidentical donor. A general approach to donor selection for allogeneic HCT is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11755609\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A HLA-haploidentical donor is one who shares, by common inheritance, exactly one HLA haplotype with the recipient and is mismatched for a variable number of HLA genes, ranging from zero to five, on the unshared haplotype. Potential HLA-haploidentical donors include biological parents; biological children; full or half siblings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72917 \">figure 1</a>); and even extended family donors such as aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, or grandchildren. </p><p>Only a related donor can be deemed to be HLA-haploidentical to a recipient because the Sanger-based sequencing methods widely used for high resolution HLA typing cannot determine whether nucleotides at polymorphic sites are located on the same (cis-position) or on a different (trans-position) chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and so alleles are assigned to haplotypes only with an assumption of relatedness. Next-generation sequencing permits direct assignment of alleles to haplotypes and may reveal previously unknown relatedness between individuals in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2066435507\"><span class=\"h1\">DECIDING TO USE A HAPLOIDENTICAL DONOR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2066435434\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice between alternative donor sources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The search for an appropriate stem cell source must consider the urgency of the procedure and potential risks of postponing transplant. Our general approach to donor selection is described in more detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91186\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91186 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H91588355\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'General approach'</a>.)</p><p>When available, a matched sibling donor is preferred over other donor sources due to improved clinical outcomes following transplant (eg, less graft-versus-host disease [GVHD]) and the speed and cost-effectiveness of the search. When a matched sibling donor is not available, the transplant center usually proceeds with an unrelated donor search. Alternative donor sources (HLA-haploidentical HCT, umbilical cord blood transplant) may be considered if there is an urgent need to proceed to transplantation or if a preliminary search indicates a low likelihood of finding an eight of eight allele-matched unrelated donor.</p><p>Despite an ever-increasing number of volunteers in the unrelated donor registries, unrelated adult donor HCT is performed in less than half of patients for whom an unrelated donor search has been activated. The following studies illustrate this issue:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 326 consecutive Italian patients activating a donor search, only 121 patients (37 percent) underwent unrelated donor transplantation at a median of 169 days (range 68 to 772 days) after search activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Searches were stopped in 192 patients (59 percent) because of patient death (n = 100), disease progression (n = 34), unlikelihood of finding a donor (n = 11), withdrawal of consent (n = 8), or choice of an alternative program (n = 39). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a similar study from Holland, unrelated donor transplants were performed in 86 of 240 patients (36 percent) activating a donor search [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p>There are no published randomized studies comparing HLA-haploidentical HCT versus umbilical cord blood transplantation. For patients with acute leukemia in complete remission or with lymphoma, the United States Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network is conducting a phase III, randomized trial of reduced intensity conditioning and transplantation of either double unrelated donor umbilical cord blood or HLA-haploidentical bone marrow (BMT CTN 1101; <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01597778&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPNoZ+a20uxFK4MxbiAOap214q41wcjGA45Zw3FooCdxaw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=96032\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT01597778</a>). For patients who are not eligible or referred for this trial, the choice between the two graft sources remains a matter of clinician preference and an assessment of the advantages and limitations described in the following section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11755615\"><span class=\"h2\">Advantages and limitations of haploidentical donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Substantial improvements in haploidentical transplantations have permitted the growing use of haploidentical family donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Sources of stem cells for allogeneic HCT include HLA-matched siblings, suitably HLA-matched unrelated donors, HLA-haploidentical donors, and unrelated umbilical cord blood. When compared with the other stem cell sources, the major advantages of the HLA-haploidentical donor option include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Near universal availability of highly motivated donors &ndash; Patients have an average of 2.7 potential HLA-haploidentical donors among first degree relatives. In comparison, only approximately 30 percent of patients will have a HLA-matched sibling, and availability of an unrelated donor genotypically matched at eight of eight alleles (HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DRB1) ranges from 16 to 75 percent depending upon the recipient's ethnic background [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid availability &ndash; The time to identify and mobilize an adult unrelated donor can be longer than three months for up to 25 percent of patients. An HLA-haploidentical donor can be identified and mobilized in two weeks to one month.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate doses of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) &ndash; HLA-haploidentical grafts have sufficient doses of HSCs for transplantation and of memory T cells for immune reconstitution. In contrast, the total dose of nucleated cells in a single umbilical cord blood unit may be suboptimal for engraftment in larger adults and immune reconstitution is delayed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H4260919\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of an umbilical cord blood graft for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Importance of cell dose'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=strategies-for-immune-reconstitution-following-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H6875587\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Strategies for immune reconstitution following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Source of hematopoietic stem cells'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low cost of graft acquisition &ndash; The costs of acquiring grafts from adult unrelated donors and especially from umbilical cord blood banks can be substantially higher than that of related donors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Availability of the donor for repeated donations of HSCs or lymphocytes to treat relapse &ndash; In contrast, umbilical cord blood is a non-recurring source of cells. If a patient suffers relapse of the underlying hematologic malignancy after umbilical cord blood transplantation, donor lymphocytes to treat the relapse are not available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-for-the-prevention-and-treatment-of-relapse-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy for the prevention and treatment of relapse following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Graft-versus-leukemia effect &ndash; For patients with high risk acute leukemia, HLA-haploidentical HCT may be associated with a stronger graft-versus-leukemia effect compared with HLA-matched sibling HCT, resulting in a lower cumulative incidence of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and an improved overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>The major challenge of HLA-haploidentical HCT is the high frequency of host and donor T cells reactive to HLA alloantigens resulting in intense bi-directional alloreactivity and, in the absence of effective prophylactic measures, high incidences of fatal graft rejection or severe or fatal GVHD. </p><p>The high incidence of bi-directional alloreactivity was illustrated in an analysis of over 2000 allogeneic HCTs performed between 1985 and 1991 and reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. When compared with HLA-matched sibling HCT, two HLA antigen-mismatched related donor transplants resulted in higher rates of the following adverse transplant outcomes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplant-related mortality (55 versus 21 percent at three years among patients with leukemia) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Graft failure (16 versus 1 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II to IV acute GVHD (56 versus 29 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV)</span> acute GVHD (36 versus 13 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic GVHD (60 versus 42 percent)</p><p/><p>Attempts at T cell depletion of the donor graft reduced the incidence of acute GVHD, but at the cost of increased incidence of graft rejection, and did not improve leukemia-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Subsequently, several advances in graft engineering and pharmacologic modulation of alloreactivity have reduced the incidences of GVHD and non-relapse mortality, improved overall and progression-free survival, and made this graft source an acceptable alternative for patients lacking an HLA-matched sibling or unrelated donor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11755627\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR SELECTION FOR HAPLOIDENTICAL HCT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2066435585\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a decision is made to proceed with HLA-haploidentical HCT, the immediate donor options include biological parents, biological children, and full or half siblings. Initial matching efforts will have already identified the HLA type of the patient and potential full sibling donors. If the initial typing of the full siblings has identified an HLA-haploidentical donor and that sibling is eligible and willing to donate, it may not be necessary to perform HLA typing of parents, children, or half siblings. However, even if there is at least one HLA-haploidentical sibling, our general practice is to type up to four potential HLA-haploidentical first degree relatives to optimize donor selection and to increase the likelihood that at least one donor will pass eligibility screening.</p><p>Most patients will have more than one HLA-haploidentical first degree relative willing and able to donate. Several of the criteria for selecting donors, such as ABO blood type and cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus of the donor and recipient, sex mismatch, and donor age and parity, apply to HLA-haploidentical transplant but are not unique to partially HLA-mismatched HCT and are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Unique considerations for partially HLA-mismatched HCT include donor-specific HLA antibodies, donor relationship, donor-recipient HLA mismatch, non-inherited maternal antigens, and natural killer cell alloreactivity. These are discussed in the following sections. Donor selection guidelines that are used at our institution are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99884 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Briefly, the only absolute contraindications to the use of a specific HLA-haploidentical donor are if the donor is medically or psychologically unfit or if the recipient has anti-donor HLA antibodies of sufficient strength to result in a positive crossmatch result by flow cytometry or by complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay. Using modern graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis protocols, there is no need to minimize the extent of mismatch between donor and recipient. As with other graft sources, clinicians prioritize ABO compatible donors; those with CMV IgG serologic status that matches the patient; younger adults rather than older adults or children; and male or nulliparous female donors rather than multiparous female donors for male recipients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11755633\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor-specific HLA antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potential donor should <strong>not</strong> be used if the patient has donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA) against that donor. If the patient has no HLA-matched donors and is sensitized to all potential HLA-haploidentical donors, strong consideration should be given to finding an unrelated donor or umbilical cord blood graft to which the patient has not been sensitized. If no other graft source can be identified, desensitization to lower the concentration of DSA and facilitate engraftment can be considered in centers with the appropriate expertise in HLA antibody testing and interpretation of results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Patients may become sensitized to HLA alloantigens by prior blood transfusions, allogeneic transplantation, or pregnancy. Among patients referred for allogeneic HCT, approximately 20 to 23 percent will have detectable HLA antibodies and 15 percent will have DSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11,12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14</a>]. In a study of 296 candidates for haploidentical HCT, of whom 38 percent were female, the overall incidence of DSA was 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. DSA against at least one HLA-haploidentical donor was found in 5 percent (9 out of 185) of males, 13 percent (6 out of 48) of nulliparous females, and 43 percent (27 out of 63) of parous women. </p><p>DSA have consistently been associated with an increased risk of graft failure after HLA-haploidentical HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11,12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14</a>]. In one study, graft failure occurred in three of four haploidentical HCT recipients with DSA as compared with 1 of 20 patients without DSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and, in another study, in three of five patients with high levels of DSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11755639\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor-recipient HLA mismatch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early studies of HLA-haploidentical HCT using T cell-replete bone marrow grafts showed significantly worse outcomes with increasing donor-recipient HLA disparity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>]. However, with modern supportive care including graft engineering and GVHD prophylactic regimens developed specifically for HLA-haploidentical HCT, the deleterious effect of HLA mismatching on transplantation outcome has been substantially reduced or even eliminated. Using modern GVHD prophylaxis protocols, there is no need to minimize the extent of mismatch between donor and recipient.</p><p>Examples of studies that have examined the association of HLA mismatching with transplant outcomes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 509 recipients of unmanipulated haploidentical HCT performed for acute leukemia found no association between the cumulative number of HLA mismatches and GVHD, transplant-related mortality, disease-free survival, or relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Those who share paternal HLA antigens are mismatched for both inherited and non-inherited maternal HLA haplotypes. In utero exposure of the fetus to maternal cells may induce immunologic hyporesponsiveness to non-inherited maternal HLA antigens (NIMA), which may result in reduced alloreactivity against a NIMA-mismatched, HLA-haploidentical sibling after HCT. While further studies are needed to clarify the role of NIMA in donor selection, if other factors are equal, mismatching of maternal, rather than paternal, antigens is better tolerated in haploidentical transplant. Selection based upon NIMA requires HLA typing of at least one parent to determine the origin of the inherited and non-inherited HLA haplotypes.</p><p>The impact of NIMA on outcome after transplant is illustrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following outcomes were noted in a study of 269 subjects receiving one or two antigen-mismatched sibling or parental non-T cell depleted transplants, using data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sibling transplants mismatched for paternal antigens had similar rates of transplant-related mortality and graft failure, but higher rates of acute GVHD than maternal-mismatched transplants (relative risk [RR]: 1.86, 95% CI 1.15-3.05).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the first four months post-transplant, father-to-child transplants involved significantly more chronic GVHD than mother-to-child transplants (RR: 2.44, 95% CI 1.12-5.34).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When compared with maternal-mismatched sibling transplants, a transplant from either parent was equally likely to be associated with an increase in treatment-related mortality (RR: 2 for each).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis of 118 consecutive patients with acute leukemia evaluated the effect of sex of the parent on subsequent survival following T cell depleted haploidentical transplantation from a parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) gene complex encodes up to 15 genes for NK cell immunoglobulin-like receptors that recognize epitopes of HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, which are also called KIR ligands. The potential benefit of KIR ligand incompatibility or of KIR haplotype B donors needs to be evaluated prospectively in the haploidentical HCT setting before the widespread incorporation of these factors on selecting donors.</p><p>The &quot;missing self&quot; hypothesis states that &quot;self&quot; major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules deliver inhibitory signals through NK cell receptors and that the absence of &quot;self&quot; MHC on a virally infected or tumor target permits NK cell cytotoxicity against that target. After HLA-haploidentical HCT, HLA mismatch between donor and recipient creates a situation in which recipient leukemia cells lack inhibitory &quot;self&quot; HLA ligands for KIRs, on donor NK cells, thereby permitting an NK cell-mediated graft-versus-leukemia effect. Absence of HLA ligands on recipient cells for donor inhibitory KIRs (KIR ligand incompatibility) predicted NK cell alloreactivity in vitro and was associated with a potent anti-leukemia effect after T cell-depleted, &quot;megadose&quot; HLA-haploidentical HCT for acute myeloid, but not acute lymphocytic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In contrast, beneficial effect of KIR ligand incompatibility was not found after T cell-replete, HLA-haploidentical HCT, perhaps because GVHD-producing T cells mask the beneficial effects of NK cell alloreactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>KIR genes are inherited as haplotypes.

The mechanism of HLA loss was loss of heterozygosity in an extensive region on chromosome 6p via acquired uniparental disomy, in which the HLA locus from the shared chromosome replaces the mismatched HLA locus on the unshared chromosome six. Loss of mismatched HLA occurs more frequently among patients relapsing nine or more months after HLA haploidentical HCT, and leukemia cells lacking mismatched HLA expression are not expected to respond to infusions of lymphocytes from the original HLA-haploidentical HCT donor. </p><p>Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) are capable of inducing sustained remissions of hematologic malignancies in relapse after HLA-haploidentical HCT if the mismatched HLA haplotype is maintained. Cases that have lost expression of the mismatched HLA haplotype are candidates for a second haploidentical HCT from a relative who is HLA-mismatched to the original donor.</p><p>Our general practice is to reserve DLI for patients with documented relapse of the underlying hematologic malignancy. Patients with overt leukemia receive re-induction chemotherapy followed by 10<sup>6</sup> CD3<sup>+</sup> T <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg,</span> one or two days after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients with less aggressive malignancies may be treated with DLI alone. In the absence of GVHD and disease response, the dose may be escalated to a maximum of 10<sup>7</sup> CD3<sup>+</sup> T <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span>.</p><p>This approach is supported by the following studies:</p><p>In one study, 40 patients in relapse after HLA-haploidentical HCT with post-transplantation <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (PTCy) were treated with a total of 52 DLIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. The most commonly used dose for the first DLI was 10<sup>6</sup> CD3+ T cells per kilogram of recipient ideal body weight.

Acute GVHD developed in 10 patients (25 percent), six with grade III-IV, and three patients developed chronic GVHD. Twelve (30 percent) patients achieved a complete response with a median response duration of 11.8 months. </p><p>In another report of DLI after HLA-haploidentical HCT with PTCy, 42 patients received a total of 108 DLI, with a median interval from transplant to DLI of 266 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-haploidentical-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twenty patients with leukemia in molecular relapse received DLI alone (n = 17) or with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a> (n = 3) with a response rate of 45 percent.

(See <a href=\"#H11755609\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An appropriate candidate for haploidentical HCT is the patient who lacks an HLA-matched sibling donor and for whom a suitably matched unrelated donor cannot be identified and mobilized in a suitable time frame. There are no published randomized comparisons of haploidentical HCT versus either umbilical cord blood HCT or mismatched unrelated donor HCT; the choice between these alternative graft sources depends upon urgency of the transplant and upon institutional preference. (See <a href=\"#H2066435507\" class=\"local\">'Deciding to use a haploidentical donor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major advantages of haploidentical HCT are the near universal availability of highly motivated donors, rapid availability and relatively low cost of the stem cell source, adequate doses of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation and immune reconstitution, and the availability of the donor for repeated donations of stem cells or lymphocytes to treat relapse. The major challenge of HLA-haploidentical HCT is the high frequency of host and donor T cells reactive to HLA alloantigens resulting in intense bi-directional alloreactivity and, in the absence of effective prophylactic measures, high incidences of fatal graft rejection or severe or fatal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Most patients will have more than one HLA-haploidentical first degree relative willing and able to donate. Criteria to consider in selecting the optimal donor include: donor health, age, and gender, relationship to the patient, HLA mismatch in both the host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host directions, ABO blood type, cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, and possibly non-inherited maternal antigen (NIMA) matching and natural killer cell alloreactivity as predicted by donor killer immunoglobulin receptor (KIR) haplotyping and KIR ligand matching with the recipient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99884 \">table 1</a>).

TCD &quot;megadose&quot; stem cell grafts have been associated with slow immune reconstitution and infectious mortality approaching 40 percent. Although slightly slower than that seen with matched sibling HCT, immune reconstitution using the GIAC protocol or PTCy is faster than seen with TCD.
