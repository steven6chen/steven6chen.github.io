Medical professionals who would logically be involved in such events include, among others, radiation safety officers, radiologists, radiation oncologists, nuclear medicine physicians, emergency department physicians, hematologists, medical oncologists, gastroenterologists, infectious disease specialists, as well as primary care providers. All will be asked to play a significant role in evaluating and treating victims of an accidental or deliberate exposure to radiation. Due to their experience in managing patients with cytopenias <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> marrow aplasia, hematologists will most likely be asked to take primary or consultative responsibility for medically treating individuals exposed to a moderate or high dose of radiation.</p><p>However, all physicians, and especially medical triage personnel, must have an understanding of how radiation alters the function of cells, tissues, and organ systems, how radiation levels are quantified, and how victims receiving a significant radiation dose can be recognized and categorized. These issues are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and clinical features of radiation injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Scenarios have been developed for response to terrorist events resulting in small volume as well as mass casualties. The Strategic National Stockpile Radiation Working Group has developed a consensus opinion to provide guidance for estimating radiation dose, clinical assessment of exposed individuals, and medical management of those patients suffering from acute radiation injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Responding medical personnel must also be aware of local, state, and national resources that may be employed in the case of a radiation accident from whatever cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These subjects, as well as the treatment of patients with radiation injuries, will be discussed here.</p><p>Treatment of radiation accidents in children is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of radiation exposure in children following a nuclear disaster&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SCENARIOS FOR RADIATION ACCIDENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive radiation doses may result from a number of different exposures, as described below:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Accidental</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accidental exposure involves the release of radioactivity from small, usually sealed, sources (ie, nuclear medicine, brachytherapy, industrial gauges, small calibration sources), accidental overtreatment with radiation therapy, transportation accidents, and nuclear power plant accidents.</p><p>With the exception of accidents at nuclear reactor sites, such as Chernobyl, such exposures have usually involved only a small number of persons and a small area of nuclear contamination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and clinical features of radiation injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Sources of data on radiation effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Deliberate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examples of deliberate exposure to radiation might include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An attack on a nuclear power plant</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A malevolent act using simple radiologic devices, such as sealed sources of radiation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Terrorist use of a radiological dispersal device (RDD or &quot;dirty bomb&quot;) using a small or large source of radioactivity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spent nuclear fuel</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detonation of an improvised nuclear device (IND) or a nuclear weapon using a critical mass of fissionable material (eg, weapons-grade uranium or plutonium)</p><p/><p>The two most likely scenarios would involve either an RDD or IND, with the former being more probable. Both warrant further discussion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiologic dispersion devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the United States Federal Government's accounting office, approximately 10 million &quot;sealed sources&quot; of radioactive material exist in 50 countries, including the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These sources of radioactive material (eg, Cesium-137, Strontium-90, Cobalt-60, Plutonium-238, Plutonium-239) are encased in metal and are used in equipment for medical, industrial, agricultural, and research purposes. Of the 612 sealed sources that were reported lost or stolen since 1995, 254 have not been recovered. Many additional sealed sources may be unaccounted for as well.</p><p>Such material may be used by terrorists for making an RDD. When used with conventional explosives, radioactive substances may be dispersed over a relatively limited area (eg, a few city blocks) with the intent to cause fear or panic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. RDDs prepared with a radioactive powder, solution, or gas may be dispersed over a larger area, and pose a minimal radiation threat, but will result in a large number of persons presenting for concerns of radiation exposure.</p><p>An important exception to this is the scenario in which the patient is imbedded with radioactive fragments or shrapnel. These will be highly radioactive and can result in significant radionecrosis of local tissue in a short period of time, requiring urgent removal. Procedures for removing such fragments are described below (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Removal of radioactive fragments'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Improvised nuclear devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An improvised nuclear device (IND) employs radioactive material which, following detonation, results in a nuclear reaction (eg, atom bomb, hydrogen bomb). Fission, the splitting of the atom, is exploited in a nuclear detonation. An uncontrolled fission chain reaction generates an enormous amount of energy in a small period of time. This process results in the generation of three forms of energy, which are released from such nuclear explosions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heat (approximately 35 percent of total energy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shock or bomb blast (approximately 50 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation (approximately 15 percent)</p><p/><p>The blast wave from a nuclear explosion results in fractures, lacerations, rupture of viscera, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and embolic events, while the thermal energy causes flash burns, flame burns, flash blindness, and retinal burns. Regardless of the source of radioactive material, the presence of multiple injuries is a mortality multiplier, owing to the predisposition to infection from trauma and burns, compounded by the immunosuppression and cytopenias caused by radiation doses as low as 1.0 Gy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and clinical features of radiation injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Hematopoietic syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>As an example, it has been estimated that 65 to 70 percent of the injuries sustained in a nuclear war will be varying combinations of burns, wounds, and irradiation, while the remainder will be single injuries equally divided between irradiation and burns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Generation of radionuclides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The generation of radionuclides consequent to a nuclear weapon detonation occurs as a result of byproduct generation during nuclear fission as well as through neutron activation of stable elements, which are usually ground sources (eg, soil). The primary fission products, radionuclides, constitute a spectrum of hundreds of species with differing half-lives and varying biologic importance.</p><p>Many of these nuclides are the starting point of their own decay chain. These radionuclides continue to decay, releasing radiation, until they finally become stable. The principal nuclides per megaton of fission are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77241\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77241 \">table 1</a>). Knowledge of these radionuclides becomes important and clinically meaningful as may be encountered during or subsequent to fallout (see <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid protection'</a> below). The clinician may encounter them in an externally or internally contaminated patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TRIAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the case of an accident or intentional event involving nuclear material, the first responders will likely include members of a HAZMAT team, local fire and police departments, and individuals knowledgeable in radiological monitoring from a state agency, such as the State Department of Environmental Protection. Many states have or will be setting up Weapons of Mass Destruction- Civil Support Teams, which can significantly augment the command system and can deploy within four hours at the request of a governor or the President of the United States.</p><p>With the advent of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), numerous monetary grants have been awarded to enhance the capabilities of first responders. Moreover, DHS's significant restructuring of numerous federal agencies has unified numerous efforts. One of the seminal efforts has been the development of the National Response Plan (NRP). The NRP is a single all-discipline, all-hazards plan. This comprehensive plan revolutionizes the federal response to terrorism, major disasters, and other emergencies by treating crisis management (eliminating the threat) and consequence management (mitigating the health consequences) as a single integrated function under DHS.</p><p>The NRP also includes the implementation of the National Incident Management System (NIMS) to ensure that all levels of government are able to work together during a disaster. In the event of a significant detonation, the Initial NRP calls for self-deployment of several federal assets and agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Their responsibilities are to manage the consequences of the incident by means of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/1,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protecting the public</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limiting further damage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring the extent and types of radioactivity present</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Performing decontamination</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disposing of radioactive material</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making decisions concerning evacuation, relocation, shelter, need for potassium iodide, as well as guidance for other protective actions</p><p/><p>Medical centers, in turn, must develop and rehearse radiation response plans that coordinate their efforts with those of local, state, regional, and national response teams.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prehospital triage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial triage will be performed by first-responders, who will not enter a radiation environment until the extent of the hazard is known. A HAZMAT team will likely self-deploy and arrive on the scene early on to guide other responders. Some first responders may carry electronic pocket dosimeters that would alert them to the presence of radiation. All participants should be volunteers whenever possible.</p><p>First responders should work in teams and should be monitored with physical dosimetry if possible. In a true emergency, the equivalent dose to a large portion of an emergency responder's body may approach 0.5 Sv (50 rem) in a short time. The volunteer needs to understand the associated risk for potential acute effects, which are minimal to none, but that there may be some increased risk for subsequent malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and clinical features of radiation injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Examples of radiation exposures'</a>.)</p><p>First responders will receive protective action guidance. Early on, data may be sparse, and this will be based on the best scientific guess. Protective gear should include eye protection, respiratory protection, gloves, and physical dosimetry if possible. Clothes and a fire fighter's bunker gear will afford some protection of the skin. First responders and all other health care providers must use strict isolation precautions (disposable gowns, double gloves, masks, cap, shoe covers) for personal protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. Outer gloves should be changed often to avoid cross-contamination. Protective gear should be removed after use and placed in a clearly labeled, sealed plastic container.</p><p>Early management in the field and the emergency department should follow basic triage principles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76009 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Life-threatening injuries, if present, should be treated even before assessing the amount of radiation exposure. It should be assumed that all victims are contaminated, either externally by deposit of radioactive material on the skin surface, or internally by absorption of radiation through the skin after being physically covered by radioactive material or by ingestion or by inhalation of radioactive material. Victims should be stabilized and transported to a medical facility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injured victims should be treated by standard triage guidelines. Preliminary decontamination (ie, removal of clothing, washing of the victim) should remove 90 to 95 percent of external contamination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there are many victims, persons who are externally contaminated and are without other injury should be relocated to an upwind site other than the hospital in order to decongest the hospital care system. Thereafter, assessment and prevention of contamination, treatment of minor injuries, and evaluation and treatment of internal contamination should be addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Removal of radioactive fragments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Providers involved in the removal of radioactive fragments or shrapnel from an exploded device must first consult the radiation safety officer (RSO). Shielding barriers, which are found in many operating rooms owing to their need in brachytherapy insertion and removal, will afford some protection.</p><p>Finger ring dosimeters should be worn by physicians removing such fragments. At a minimum they should be worn on the dominant hand, although having one on each hand is optimal. Unfortunately, these dosimeters are not read locally. However, an electronic pocket dosimeter (EPD) could be taped on the forearm, under the gown, for real-time reading. The RSO can then calculate the dose to the fingers based on this reading and the operating distance.</p><p>Physicians should work in teams with frequent monitoring of the radiation dose so that exposure time can be minimized; pregnant personnel should be excluded from such efforts. Removed fragments should be placed into a lead container and covered. Both finger ring dosimeters and suitable lead containers are available from the medical center's Nuclear Medicine department. These steps should significantly minimize the risk to the provider and lessen their risk of local radiation injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">In hospital triage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals arriving in the Emergency Department (ED) who may have been exposed to or contaminated with radiation will set off facility portal monitors and alarming dosimeters. Screening should be conducted by individuals knowledgeable in the use of radiation detection equipment, including a Radiation Safety Officer (RSO), health physicist, nuclear medicine personnel, or trained ED staff. Screening equipment includes instruments that can detect the presence of external alpha-emitters (eg, hand-held detector), beta-emitters (except for low-energy particles), and gamma-emitters. The RSO or health physicist should be involved at the outset to act as a liaison to emergency personnel for rapid background information about radiation exposure and contamination that may be used to guide practice. &#160;</p><p>All healthcare workers must use Universal Precautions, including a minimum of double gloves and double gowns. Outer gloves and gowns should be changed after contact with individuals having a high risk of contamination. After use, protective gear should be discarded in a clearly labeled, sealed plastic container. All staff should wear a personal dosimeter under the gown such as a film badge or an electronic pocket dosimeter (EPD). Finger ring dosimeters may be also used, particularly when removing radioactive shrapnel. Pregnant healthcare providers should not be permitted to work with in areas where contamination may occur.</p><p>Over 90 percent of contamination can be removed by removal of the patient's clothing. The removed clothing should be placed in a clearly labeled, plastic receptacle and stored in a secure location designated by the RSO. An additional 90 percent or more of radioactivity can be removed by showering or cleansing with a mild soap and water or saline. If there is suspected internal contamination, the RSO, health physicist, or nuclear medicine physician should be consulted. If feasible, a separate decontamination site for non-urgent patients should be used to avoid contaminating the treatment facility. Detailed guidelines are available at the <a href=\"http://www.remm.nlm.gov/&amp;token=twcGxy/8D9pHAGbYCyoWK8qvkngU+WYh9DQFxWiZKcSvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=8366\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Radiation Emergency Medical Management (REMM)</a> website, which presents an authoritative guide to management of specific types of decontamination. If internal contamination is present, collection of waste materials separately is preferable for identification and quantification of radioisotopes.</p><p>Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of a serious medical injury, including intractable pain, loss of consciousness, seizures, and acute hemorrhage. They should be also monitored for signs of acute radiation injury such as vomiting, fever, and profound confusion. </p><p>Medical care should include the following, in order of importance: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resuscitation and first aid.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical stabilization.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decontamination.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of minor injuries. </p><p/><p>Since even high-dose radiation exposure and contamination are not lethal within the initial two weeks, emergent medical care takes precedence over assessment of the degree of exposure and identification of radioisotopes. Exposed and contaminated patients who are medically unstable should be stabilized before they are decontaminated. They require admission to a critical care area or routine care floor of the hospital.</p><p>Patients with exposure and contamination and minor injury should be decontaminated before being treated for injury. Patients who have been exposed but who are not contaminated should be processed normally through the ED. They may require admission to the hospital if their exposure dose is significant. Patients who are found to have no exposure and no contamination should be triaged to usual care in the ED with the understanding that psychosocial needs may be significant. Those with visible emotional distress that is greater than a normal stress reaction to the radiation incident may require psychological first aid, crisis counseling, and ambulatory follow-up with a behavioral health or mental health specialist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>In addition to obtaining historical information on the patient's location at the time of presumed exposure, initial laboratory testing should be obtained, including a complete blood count (CBC) including platelet count. If internal contamination is suspected, urine and stool samples should be obtained. All biological fluids should be handled according to standard laboratory practices. If these practices are followed, the laboratory worker is not at risk for contamination by handling biological samples obtained from a contaminated patient.</p><p>The amount of radioactive material deposited on a venipuncture needle used to obtain blood from a vessel beneath contaminated skin is presumed to be negligible. Time and resources permitting, used sharps should be placed in a labeled sharps container. To reduce the potential for contamination of the facility (and consequently, other individuals), patients who may be contaminated should use a designated bathroom that is not available to others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety of health care providers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety of health care providers is of paramount importance. Health care providers should approach the patient as though he or she has been contaminated with human blood, body fluids, or raw sewage. This requires donning a gown, mask, double gloves, cap, and shoe covers. Outer gloves should be changed frequently to avoid cross-contamination. Following use, protective gear should be removed and placed in a labeled, sealed plastic container. Pregnant healthcare providers should not be permitted to work in areas where contamination may occur.</p><p>Provided that these universal precautions are taken, it is extremely unlikely that radioactive contamination will occur, even when treating a patient with a heavy burden of radioactive material. In fact, there are no reports of health care workers who have adhered to this protocol becoming contaminated from handling such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. All hospital personnel should be assessed for contamination when leaving the treatment area and decontaminated, if required.</p><p>Additional precautions need to be taken when the patient is imbedded with radioactive fragments. These are discussed above (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Removal of radioactive fragments'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After arrival in the emergency department, victims should be classified based on whether or not they have been exposed to radioactive material, contaminated by radioactive material, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> received physical injury. It is critical that the clinician appreciates the difference between exposure to and contamination by radiation. Exposure may be thought of as having been exposed to heat (thermal energy) that emanates from a campfire. By contrast, contamination may be visualized as having been splattered by radioactive paint (external exposure) or having internalized the paint by ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin (internal exposure). Although external contamination is easily detected by monitoring with a hand-held G-M probe, detection of internal contamination is confirmed only by examining nasal swabs and excreta (urine and feces) for radioisotopes. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; </p><p>The vast majority of individuals arriving in the emergency department after an event involving an RDD are likely to have insignificant or no exposure. Nevertheless, these individuals may have significant psychosocial needs. Clinicians should be able to identify those victims whose exposure is significant, using principles presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and clinical features of radiation injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Assessment of radiation dose'</a>.)</p><p>When necessary, and if not already performed, contaminated victims should be decontaminated after clinical assessment of injury severity has been made. Depending on the situation, a trauma surgeon, burn specialist, dermatologist, gastroenterologist, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologist may be consulted, in addition to the hematologist. Information regarding risk level should be provided to medical caregivers by the medical center's radiation safety officer, radiologist, nuclear medicine physician, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation oncologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">History taking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historical information, including the location of the incident, duration of exposure, interval between exposure and clinical evaluation, activity and exact location at the time of exposure, and occupation of the victim should be documented in the medical record. Other information, such as a general description of the accident, source of radiation, and numbers of individuals involved in the exposure should be documented, whenever possible.</p><p>Generally, the clinical signs and symptoms of radiation exposure are nonspecific. However, the presence or absence of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding, fatigue, fever, and mental changes should be noted. If the patient has experienced vomiting, the time of onset after the exposure should be noted as accurately as possible, since such information is of extreme importance in estimating the degree of radiation exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82508\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82508 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-clinical-features-of-radiation-injury-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and clinical features of radiation injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should include vital signs (fever, hypotension, orthostatic changes), skin examination (erythema, blistering, edema, desquamation), neurologic examination (level of consciousness, ataxia, <span class=\"nowrap\">motor/sensory</span> deficits, presence or absence of reflexes, papilledema), gastrointestinal examination (abdominal tenderness, gastrointestinal bleeding) and hematologic examination (ecchymoses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> petechiae of mucous membranes and skin).</p><p>A schema has been developed to assess the severity of changes in the clinical examination according to standardized cutaneous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62805 \">table 4</a>), gastrointestinal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70498\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70498 \">table 5</a>), cerebrovascular (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53121\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53121 \">table 6</a>), and hematopoietic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51611\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51611 \">table 7</a>) radiation injury scoring systems.

For example, obtaining bilateral nasal swab samples within the first hour of the incident can provide valuable information. As an example, the extent of nares contamination is approximately 5 percent of that received by the pulmonary alveoli. For victims in whom internal contamination is suspected, peripheral blood (for the same tests as ordered for an external exposure), urine, nasal smears, spontaneous vomitus, and stools should be obtained for radiological monitoring. Hospital staff must take precautions with the handling of these samples as they may be radioactive. Any patient with wound contamination or imbedded with radioactive fragments should be evaluated for such internal contamination.</p><p>Initial laboratory testing should include a complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell differential and platelet count, along with routine chemistry tests. The time of CBC collection must be carefully noted, because of important time-related changes in the lymphocyte count (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82508\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82508 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>If possible, serial CBCs should then be obtained every 6 to 12 hours for at least three samples. Twenty-four hours after any significant exposure, a blood sample should be drawn into a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>&nbsp;heparin tube and sent to an appropriate referral lab for confirmatory chromosomal aberration analysis. This information may also aid in the patient's management and the determination of overall prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82508\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82508 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Additional monitoring should be based on the whole-body dose, as the onset of neutropenia and its severity are dose dependent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65095\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65095 \">figure 1</a>).

Similar results have also been reported for non-human primates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/33-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-39</a>].</p><p>The mean lethal dose of radiation required to kill 50 percent of humans at 60 days <span class=\"nowrap\">(LD50/60)</span> is a whole-body radiation dose between 3.25 to 4 Gy in persons managed without any supportive care, and 6 to 7 Gy when antibiotics and transfusion support are provided. Extrapolating from the survival benefit demonstrated in animal studies, the lethal dose may be somewhat higher with early initiation of colony stimulating factors. However, a whole-body dose &gt;10 Gy is likely to be lethal.</p><p>Given the similarities between patients with the hematopoietic radiation injury syndrome and those undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation, many of the fundamentals in supportive care, prophylaxis, blood product support, and infection management remain the same.

The likelihood of identifying patients who might benefit from HCT seems slim when hospital beds and the necessary personnel to carry out sophisticated support services have also been damaged or destroyed.</p><p/><p>Using HCT to treat radiation victims requires an accurate assessment of exposure. As an example, doses below 3 Gy would usually not be fatal if excellent nursing care was available, and the upper dose limit that can be survived without HCT might be in the range of 7 Gy following the prompt use of hematopoietic growth factors and aggressive supportive care. On the other hand, doses in excess of 10 Gy are likely to be fatal because of injury to organ systems other than bone marrow (eg, cerebrovascular and gastrointestinal).

This leaves only a very small fraction of patients who might benefit from HCT (ie, doses of 7 to 10 Gy for those receiving allogeneic HCT and 4 to 10 Gy for those able to receive autologous or syngeneic HCT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H881196\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A review of radiation incident registries indicated that of 31 patients who underwent HCT, 27 patients died, and the remaining four patients survived with a rejected allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Using the GRADE system, the WHO panel of experts analyzed outcomes from HCT in three reported radiation accidents, and determined that the majority of transplant recipients developed non-hematopoietic organ failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Survival was more likely among individuals receiving &lt;9 Gy and no HCT. A weak recommendation was made for the administration of HCT to irradiated individuals after failure of two to three weeks of cytokine treatment to induce recovery from marrow failure in the absence of non-hematopoietic organ failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53\"><span class=\"h2\">Case selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most favorable situation would involve a patient who had fully compatible hematopoietic stem cells immediately available for an autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Military personnel at high risk might have such cells stored for emergency purposes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may have stored stem cells as a potential backup treatment for a previously documented malignancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may have their own umbilical cord blood in long-term storage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Collection and storage of umbilical cord blood for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with identical twins (syngeneic HCT)</p><p/><p>It would seem wise to be liberal in the use of HCT to treat these patients and to err on the side of overutilization, since complications of either autologous or syngeneic HCT in this setting should be minimal.</p><p>However, it is unlikely that victims of radiation overexposure fall into any of the above settings or even know that they have an HLA matched sibling. It is even more unlikely that a patient would have had a recently completed search for a matched unrelated donor. The ability to carry out either of these activities after a radiation event depends upon the size of the event and the number of injured victims. However, it is possible that HLA typing of siblings or an accelerated search for an unrelated donor might be accomplished when the number of victims is small.</p><p>A haplotype-matched donor might be considered, especially in children. Unfortunately, available data on the treatment of radiation injury with allogeneic HCT are not encouraging:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 29 patients who underwent HCT after accidental radiation overdose, the median survival was only 33 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. While all 29 patients had some evidence of engraftment (ie, 10 to 100 percent of bone marrow cells being of donor origin) 14 days post-transplant, there was no evidence for permanent engraftment in any of the survivors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with burns died and only three patients survived for more than one year, two following infusion of bone marrow stem cells and one following use of fetal liver cells. It is impossible to determine whether or not their survival was related to the HCT, since no survivor had permanent donor engraftment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 7 of the 29 patients (24 percent) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was felt to be a major contributing cause of death.</p><p/><p>Similar results were observed in two radiation accidents in Japan, where two of three victims received allogeneic HCT plus cytokine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. One patient received a mismatched unrelated umbilical cord blood HCT and the other received a HLA identical sibling donor HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Both transplanted patients demonstrated transient donor cell engraftment followed by autologous hematopoietic recovery before eventually dying of other radiation injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54\"><span class=\"h2\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is difficult to be optimistic about a major contribution of HCT in the treatment of patients with radiation injury. The chance of identifying patients with lethal marrow injury, no lethal injury to other organs, no severe burns or trauma, and an intact medical infrastructure, seems poor. In addition, allogeneic HCT places patients at risk for potential complications such as GVHD. The prognosis for a transplant patient following radiation injury would be even worse <span class=\"nowrap\">if/when</span> additional complications occur, such as infection and respiratory failure. In particular, a mass casualty situation requires an early estimation of prognosis in order to appropriately address available resources to those most likely to survive admission to an intensive care unit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-cancer-patients-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of cancer patients in the intensive care unit&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethics-in-the-intensive-care-unit-informed-consent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethics in the intensive care unit: Informed consent&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the rare patient with a significant exposure (ie, 4 to 10 Gy) who might have an autologous or syngeneic HCT option, a stem cell infusion should be considered, as it would have low morbidity and would likely lead to earlier hematologic reconstitution, which might be lifesaving (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57598\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57598 \">table 9</a>).</p><p>If resources allow, the use of a matched sibling or unrelated allogeneic HCT can be considered in the rare patient with a significant exposure (ie, 7 to 10 Gy), with minimal to no extramedullary injuries, and with a rapidly identified volunteer donor. Additional considerations should be given to the exploration of novel transplant methods (eg, non-myeloablative HCT) and stem cell sources (eg, umbilical cord blood HCT) in this small subset of irradiated victims deemed eligible for such treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER MEDICAL ISSUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune reconstitution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immune reconstitution in some patients will likely be aberrant and radiation dose-dependent, especially since single fraction total body irradiation (TBI) is more immunosuppressive than fractionated TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Extrapolating from the transplantation literature, functional hyposplenism may occur following transplantation with total body irradiation-containing regimens. However, many of these patients had allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and also had chronic graft-versus-host disease. It is difficult to predict the extent to which radiation may affect splenic function, but it should be assessed as a potential long-term risk for those patients with a significant exposure who survive the event.</p><p>Accordingly, convalescent serologies should be assessed at one year following any significant whole body exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system#H17005404\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;, section on 'Antibody deficiency and defects'</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, one should consider monitoring of immunoglobulin levels in these patients, especially in the presence of recurrent sinopulmonary infections.

In patients receiving intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) for longer than one year, delayed immune production of immunoglobulins may occur. Moreover, revaccination of patients who have received immunoglobulin replacement within three months may yield a suboptimal response.</p><p>Revaccination should follow the <span class=\"nowrap\">CDC/ASBMT/IDSA</span> guidelines with the additional consideration of vaccination for polysaccharide encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcal pneumonia, Neisseria meningococcus, and Hemophilus influenzae type B if functional hyposplenism is suspected. Repeat serologies to assess vaccination efficacy is warranted.</p><p>The IDSA clinical practice guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections among HCT recipients, as well as other IDSA guidelines, can be accessed through the Infectious Diseases Society of America's web site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Immunization of unaffected family members can be useful to reduce the risk of exposure to infectious agents and provide some protection to the patient during the period before immunization is possible. The patient should avoid exposure to any individual who has received the oral polio vaccine, since transmission of virus is possible for weeks after the immunization. The inactivated polio vaccine is advisable for family members to avoid risk of transmission.</p><p>If a serologic response is not achieved, use of prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-v-potassium-oral-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin V</a> or another antibiotic with activity against encapsulated bacteria should be considered. Live vaccines should not be given until at least 24 months after exposure and should only be done in patients with some evidence of immune recovery. This may require consultation with an Immunologist.</p><p>There is a substantial clinical database showing that myelosuppressive chemotherapy or myeloablative conditioning prior to HCT has deleterious effects on immune recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary immunodeficiency due to underlying disease states, environmental exposures, and miscellaneous causes&quot;, section on 'Ionizing radiation'</a>). To date, there is no effective treatment for the prolonged T cell deficiencies associated with cytotoxic therapy.
