This drop in blood pressure can make you feel dizzy or lightheaded. It can even make you pass out. Another term for orthostatic hypotension is &quot;postural hypotension.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12521506\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of orthostatic hypotension?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms all happen when you stand up after sitting or lying down. They can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling lightheaded or dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry or dim vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting (this is called syncope)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12521513\"><span class=\"h1\">What can cause orthostatic hypotension?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many causes of orthostatic hypotension. It can happen if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is not enough fluid in your arteries &ndash; This can happen if you lose blood or if you are &quot;dehydrated,&quot; meaning you do not have enough fluids. You can get dehydrated if:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>You do not drink enough fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>You have severe diarrhea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>You sweat a lot (for example, during exercise)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your heart doesn't pump out enough blood</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nerves and hormones in your body that control the blood vessels are not working properly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You take certain medicines</p><p/><p>In some people, orthostatic hypotension is tied to another problem, such as diabetes or Parkinson disease. But people who are otherwise healthy can have orthostatic hypotension, too. Older people are more likely than younger people to have it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12521520\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you often feel dizzy or like you might pass out when you stand up, see your doctor or nurse. If you do pass out (faint), you should let your doctor know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12521527\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for orthostatic hypotension?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are a few tests that can help your doctor or nurse find out if orthostatic hypotension is causing your symptoms. The simplest test is to take your blood pressure and pulse while you are sitting or lying down and then again after you stand up. Other tests could include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to see if you have a condition called &quot;anemia,&quot; which is when the body has too few red blood cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to check that your blood has the right chemical balance and that your fluid levels are in the right range</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to make sure your heart is pumping correctly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12521534\"><span class=\"h1\">How is orthostatic hypotension treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first thing your doctor or nurse will want to do to &quot;treat&quot; your orthostatic hypotension is find out if it is caused by any medicines you take. If so, he or she might switch you to another medicine or lower your dose. Medicines that can cause orthostatic hypotension include those used to treat:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain caused by heart disease (called &quot;angina&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression</p><p/><p>There are also medicines to treat orthostatic hypotension directly. If necessary, your doctor or nurse can prescribe 1 of these medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12521541\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are a few things you can do to reduce the problems caused by orthostatic hypotension. They are listed below. But you should try these things only after talking to your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stand up slowly and give your body time to adapt. This is especially important when you get out of bed in the morning. Start by sitting up and waiting a moment. Then swing your legs over the side of the bed and wait some more. When you do stand up, make sure you have something to hold onto in case you start to feel dizzy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid running, hiking, or doing anything that takes a lot of energy in hot weather. These things can make orthostatic hypotension worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure you drink enough fluids, especially in hot weather.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put blocks under the posts at the head of your bed. This will raise your head above your heart slightly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear &quot;compression&quot; stockings. The ones that go to your waist are most helpful, but they are hard to wear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid drinking a lot of alcohol.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12521548\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
