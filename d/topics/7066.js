Based upon one large, population-based observational study, approximately 1.4 percent of infants younger than three months of age present for evaluation of fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-definition-of-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Neonates and young infants may manifest fever as the only sign of significant underlying infection. The incidence of serious bacterial infection (SBI) such as urinary tract infection, bacteremia, meningitis, and pneumonia is higher in infants younger than three months of age, particularly those under 28 days, than at any other time in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-definition-of-fever/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. In addition, these young patients can experience significant morbidity from some viral infections.

A rectal temperature of 38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) or greater is generally regarded as fever in infants 90 days of age and younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-definition-of-fever/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This temperature is the one used by the majority of studies that have focused on the risk of serious illness in young infants and corresponds to a value that is two standard deviations above the mean in this age group. We use electronic rectal thermometers with covers. Glass thermometers should not be used because of difficulties with reading the temperature correctly, risk of injury to the patient if they break, and potential for spreading infectious disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H933832557\"><span class=\"h2\">Other measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Axillary, temporal artery and tympanic membrane temperatures appear less reliable for detecting fever in young infants when compared to rectal thermometry as the gold standard but may be used when rectal thermometry is contraindicated, such as in patients with neutropenia, bleeding diathesis (eg, thrombocytopenia), or necrotizing enterocolitis. A temperature of 38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) or greater by methods other than rectal measurement should be regarded as fever and a workup should be initiated. Temperatures measured by other, non-rectal methods that are near 38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) should be interpreted on a case by case scenario using the overall clinical assessment. Options include serial exams and observation, or, a laboratory evaluation.

It is consistently lower than rectal temperature, but the absolute difference varies too widely for a standard conversion. If a rectal temperature is contraindicated, we prefer to use axillary temperature to determine if a fever is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systematic reviews have concluded that infrared tympanic membrane thermometry shows insufficient agreement with established methods of core temperature measurement to be used in situations where detection of fever has important clinical implications, such as in febrile young infants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infrared contact and non-contact forehead (temporal artery) thermometers also have contradictory results when compared to rectal temperatures and should <strong>not</strong> be used to determine the presence of fever in a young infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-definition-of-fever/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Readings may be significantly greater or lower than rectal temperature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based upon an observational study in 148 infants younger than three months of age, oral temperature measurement with a pacifier thermometer had a low sensitivity for detection of fever (48 percent) when compared to rectal temperature and a number of infants were unable or unwilling to suck on the device long enough to obtain a reading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-definition-of-fever/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Because of the variability from device to device and by site of measurement, we do <strong>not</strong> suggest altering the reported temperature based on the device used for estimating the rectal temperature. For example, it is not advised to &quot;add a degree&quot; to axillary values but rather report the value with the modifier or the method of measurement employed. As with any measured data, the clinician must then use <strong>all</strong> clinical findings to interpret the results and to plan an appropriate evaluation.</p><p>Whenever feasible, we typically measure the rectal temperature of infants initially assessed using other means of temperature measurement. When the measurements are close in time (ie, within 15 to 30 minutes), then we use the rectal temperature to determine if a fever is present. If the measurements are not close in time, then if either measurement indicates a fever, we proceed with an evaluation according to the patient age and clinical findings.

A history of objective fever by rectal temperature at home requires further evaluation according to age and clinical findings, even if the infant is afebrile at the time of presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-management#H3294776720\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Febrile infant (younger than 90 days of age): Management&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one small observational study of 40 such patients presenting to an emergency department and performed prior to widespread availability of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, the risk of bacterial infection, including urinary tract infection, bacteremia, or meningitis was approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-definition-of-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A more recent prospective cohort study performed after routine use of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b and heptavalent pneumococcal vaccines evaluated 835 infants with a documented fever by rectal temperature at home but who were afebrile when seen in a primary care office and found a risk of about 1 percent for bacteremia or meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-definition-of-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Taken together, these studies suggest that the risk of bacterial infection is substantial in infants who are afebrile on presentation but had a fever documented by rectal temperature at home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other measurements</strong> &ndash; There is limited evidence that addresses the risk of invasive bacterial illness in infants whose caregivers report a fever based upon measurements by less reliable means of temperature assessment such as axillary temperature, contact or non-contact infrared temporal artery temperature, oral pacifier thermometer, or infrared tympanic membrane temperature. Although we recommend rectal temperatures to identify the presence of fever, when caregivers report an elevated temperature within the past 24 hours that is based upon other methods of measurement, our approach is to proceed with an evaluation according to the patient age and clinical findings regardless of the rectal temperature at clinical presentation or the timing between measurements by the caregiver and the medical provider. This approach is in part informed by an understanding that fever is not a static process. In these situations, varying temperature readings over time may reflect natural variability rather than a lack of fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tactile temperature</strong> &ndash; When a caregiver reports a tactile (subjective) fever and a rectal temperature shows no fever, our approach is follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the caregiver is calling to report a tactile fever, we ask the caregiver to verify with a rectal temperature at home. If the measured rectal temperature is less than 38&deg;C, there is no documented fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the patient presents without a measured documented temperature of 38&deg;C or greater, the infant may <strong>avoid</strong> further evaluation if <strong>all</strong> of the following conditions are met:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>No antipyretic medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a>) has been given.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>History does <strong>not</strong> suggest an increased risk for bacterial infection (eg, no perinatal risk factors such as prematurity, prolonged rupture of membranes, or maternal colonization with Group B streptococcus; normal behavior and feeding; and no associated difficulty breathing, apneic spells, or color changes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Appearance and physical examination are normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Reliable follow-up within 12 to 24 hours can be arranged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Caregivers can monitor the rectal temperature at home, understand indications to seek medical attention, and have transportation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients in whom reliable follow-up is not assured and who have not received antipyretic therapy, observation for lack of fever by rectal measurement at one or two additional time points in the department (eg, for one to two feeding cycles) remains an option. It is reassuring if the patient feeds well, remains afebrile, and continues to look well. This time can be used to continue to educate parents on supportive care and signs and symptoms to return.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Based upon one very small observational study performed prior to widespread availability of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b and heptavalent pneumococcal vaccines, only one of 26 patients with tactile fever at home who were afebrile in the emergency department had a serious bacterial illness (urinary tract infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-definition-of-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The fact that these patients differ with respect to current immunization practice and the possible benefit derived from herd immunity limits interpretation of these findings in a modern-day population where the etiologies of bacterial infection and the invasiveness of the related pathogens have shifted significantly. This uncertainty increases the importance of the clinical assessment and assurance of reliable follow-up.</p><p/><p>The reliability of other means of temperature assessment when compared to rectal temperatures in young infants is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H933832557\" class=\"local\">'Other measurements'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management#H538370912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management&quot;, section on 'Site and method of measurement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Bundling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When ambient temperature and humidity permit normal heat loss (ie, humidity &lt;75 percent, ambient temperature &lt;35&deg;C [95&deg;F]), an elevated rectal temperature &gt;38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) should <strong>not</strong> be attributed to bundling in infants 7 to 90 days of age. In addition, a fever &gt;38.5&deg;C (101&deg;F) should <strong>not</strong> be attributed to bundling regardless of the manner taken. When evaluating an infant who is afebrile by rectal temperature at presentation but had a fever at home, bundling is an important factor to consider if the fever is based upon temperature measurements other than a rectal temperature. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Caregiver report of fever'</a> above.)</p><p>When ambient temperature and humidity pose a significant threat to heat loss (eg, ambient temperature &gt;35&deg;C [95&deg;F] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> relative humidity &gt;75 percent), infants who are bundled have a limited ability to acclimate and can have elevated temperatures &gt;38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) that indicate heat illness. However, infection is still an important consideration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heat-illness-other-than-heat-stroke-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heat illness (other than heat stroke) in children&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heat-stroke-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heat stroke in children&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bundling of infants in clothing or blankets generally causes an elevation in skin temperature rather than rectal temperature when ambient conditions permit normal heat loss. As an example, in a randomized trial of 64 infants 11 to 95 days of age, rectal temperature after one hour was <strong>not</strong> significantly different between bundled and unbundled infants but mean skin temperature was (1.2&deg;C higher in bundled infants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/febrile-infant-younger-than-90-days-of-age-definition-of-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, bundled young infants outside of the newborn period may feel warm but typically their rectal temperature will reflect their true core temperature. Again, this stresses the importance of using rectal measurements in young febrile infants rather than temporal artery, axillary, or other methods of temperature assessment which may be more impacted by alterations in skin temperature.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3032515679\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
