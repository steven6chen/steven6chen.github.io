Approximately 22 million of these abortions are &quot;safe&quot; and the other 20 million are &quot;unsafe&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] (see <a href=\"#H31293276\" class=\"local\">'Definition of safe and unsafe abortion'</a> below). Unsafe abortion is a major factor in maternal morbidity and mortality and accounts for about 4.7 to 13.2 percent of maternal deaths worldwide each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Women in developing countries were treated for complications related to unsafe abortion at an estimated rate of 6.9 per 1000 women, or 7.4 per 1000 women when countries where abortion is legal and widely accessible were excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Additionally, one in eight pregnancy-related deaths are the result of unsafe abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Unsafe abortion has large economic costs, as well, since the incomplete procedure creates a need for hospital care.</p><p>The risk of complications and death from unsafe abortion is inversely related to the provider&rsquo;s skill, conditions for performing the procedure, and availability of appropriate equipment. Some unsafe abortions are self-induced; the consequences in these cases also depend on whether the woman seeks medical care. Social stigma, legal threats, and fear can prevent women from accessing post-abortion care, which is a critical aspect of saving lives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In 2000, 189 nations pledged to free people from extreme poverty and multiple deprivations. This pledge became the eight Millennium Development Goals, which are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End poverty and hunger</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Universal education</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gender equality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Child health</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal health</p><p/><p>Increased efforts to provide access to safe abortion services has been identified as one of the three most important interventions for improving maternal health and reducing maternal mortality in resource poor settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The other interventions are improved access to contraception and increased access to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> to control postpartum hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approaches-to-reduction-of-maternal-mortality-in-resource-limited-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approaches to reduction of maternal mortality in resource-limited settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31293276\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF SAFE AND UNSAFE ABORTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines &quot;safe&quot; abortion as abortion in countries where abortion law is not restrictive (abortion is legally permitted for social or economic reasons, or without specification as to reason) or countries in which, despite formal law, safe abortion is broadly available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Conversely, &quot;unsafe&quot; abortion is performed by people lacking the necessary skills or using hazardous technique, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in an environment that does not meet minimum medical standards. The WHO has adopted a focus on safety to emphasize the procedure and its context rather than placing blame on the women undergoing the procedure or emphasizing its legality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Spontaneous miscarriages in which sepsis or other complications occur are also classified as unsafe abortion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31293283\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY OF UNSAFE ABORTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that 21 to 22 million unsafe abortions occur worldwide, and 98 percent of these abortions occur in the developing world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Obtaining accurate data on abortion safety is difficult, as unsafe abortion most commonly occurs in countries in which the procedure is highly restricted; therefore, the procedures occur under a cloud of secrecy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. While country-specific data on unsafe abortion vary, the regional rate appears to be highest in Latin America and the Caribbean (estimated rate of 31 per 1000 women per year; 4.2 million) and Africa (28 per 1000 women per year; 6.2 million), and lower in Asia (11 per 1000 women or 10.8 million), excluding Eastern Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Additionally, rates of hospital admissions from complications of induced abortion also vary by region, with highest rates in Asia (8.2 per 1000 women; 4.6 million), Africa (6.7 per 1000 women; 1.6 million), and Latin America and the Caribbean (5.3 per 1000 women; 0.7 million) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Socioeconomic risk determinants of unsafe abortion vary among countries. Developing countries are more likely to restrict access to legal abortion than developed countries, and this restriction affects poorer women disproportionately, leading to a higher proportion of unsafe abortion among the poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Even in countries with less restrictive abortion law, women most vulnerable to unsafe abortions are those who are younger, poorer, and lack partner support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18736535\"><span class=\"h1\">PROVIDERS AND PERFORMANCE OF UNSAFE ABORTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risks and efficacy of unsafe abortion are dependent on the type of practitioner providing the service and the method. Unsafe abortions are performed by both trained medical practitioners (eg, physicians, nurses, midwives, pharmacists) and traditional lay practitioners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, many women self-induce abortion. Traditionally, in many places where abortion has been illegal and unsafe, a woman attempts instrumentation of the uterus in order to induce bleeding. Once the diagnosis of &ldquo;spontaneous abortion&rdquo; is made, the woman can obtain appropriate medical care.</p><p>In some large urban settings, women who can afford to pay a physician may be able to find one who performs abortion discreetly in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> office by dilation and curettage or vacuum aspiration. Some physicians offer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> or initiate an abortion surgically and then advise women to present to a hospital for completion of an incomplete abortion. In rural areas, midwives and nurses provide similar services. These procedures can be unsafe even in the hands of medical providers due to the lack of adequate training, clean instruments, and sterile technique.</p><p>Often, traditional lay practitioners or women themselves induce abortion with a wide range of methods that can be classified into four broad categories: oral and injectable treatments; preparations placed in the cervix, vagina, or rectum; intrauterine instrumentation; and trauma to the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. The wide range of methods used for unsafe abortion demonstrates how desperate women can be when faced with an unplanned pregnancy and what they are willing to endure to have an abortion, despite the risks. Many women resort to a combination of approaches and often initiate the process themselves with homemade remedies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral and injectable treatments include: metal salts, phosphorus, lead, kerosene, turpentine, detergent solutions, uterine stimulants (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>, oral contraceptives, hormones (gynaecosid), and numerous teas and herbal remedies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preparations placed in the cervix, vagina, or rectum include: potassium permanganate tablets, herbal preparations, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, enemas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Instrumentation of the uterus includes: catheter insertion followed by infusion of alcohol, saline, or other solution; insertion of foreign bodies such as coat hanger, knitting needle, stick crochet hook, or air blown through a syringe. Penetration with sharp objects with potential for uterine perforation and use of unclean instruments such as unsterilized catheters are methods that pose the highest risks for morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, transcervical introduction of compounds such as mixtures of soap, cresol and phenol can cause renal toxicity, cardiac toxicity, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma to the abdomen including: self-inflicted blows, abdominal massage, jumping from a height, lifting heavy weights. Traditional practitioners commonly use vigorous abdominal massage with the idea that this will result in disruption of the pregnancy, but this can result in uterine rupture or other morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18243268\"><span class=\"h2\">Misoprostol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing access to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> in many parts of the world has altered the way in which many women obtain abortions despite the lack of legal and safe access to abortion care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. If misoprostol is administered with sufficient dosing and frequency (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-as-a-single-agent-for-medical-termination-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Misoprostol as a single agent for medical termination of pregnancy&quot;</a>), it can result in successful abortion for many women and with a low risk of complications. In other cases, misoprostol causes uterine bleeding by initiating the abortion process without the risks of instrumentation. The woman can then obtain appropriate medical care for symptoms of spontaneous abortion.</p><p>In Brazil, as is the case in many other developing countries, women have recognized the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> as a method of abortion and many women self-administer the medication to induce bleeding. This has resulted in a significantly lower infection rate from unsafe abortion in Brazil than with alternative traditional methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>In Colombia, experts estimated that half of women obtaining abortions used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, which could be obtained from a variety of informal sources; however, complications related to abortion have increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This may be because women often have inaccurate information on misoprostol use, and drug quality is a major concern, since a variety of misoprostol products on the market do not meet international standards, are poorly stored, or have expired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Shopkeepers have sold hormonal contraceptive pills, analgesics, and antibiotics to women who request a medicine to terminate pregnancy. Increased dissemination of accurate information on misoprostol use and access to high-quality drugs could reduce abortion complications related to this drug.</p><p>In addition to drug quality, drug toxicity is also a risk of self-induced abortion with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>. While misoprostol is considered a very safe medication, cases of toxicity have been reported. Mild to moderate toxicity symptoms have been reported with doses of 3 mg to 8.5 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. In addition, one case of a pregnant adolescent was reported who experienced stomach necrosis, distal esophagus, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, multiorgan failure, and ultimately death after ingesting 12 mg of misoprostol orally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These doses are much higher than the recommended guidelines for safe abortion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-as-a-single-agent-for-medical-termination-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Misoprostol as a single agent for medical termination of pregnancy&quot;</a>), but practitioners must be aware of the potential for toxicity and the signs and symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H18736908\" class=\"local\">'Chemical burns or drug toxicity'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18736549\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the developing world, it is estimated that five million women are admitted to hospitals for treatment of complications from induced abortions each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/4,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,27</a>]. Women in developing countries were treated for complications related to unsafe abortion at an estimated rate of 6.9 per 1000 women, or 7.4 per 1000 women when countries where abortion is legal and widely accessible were excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>A systematic review evaluated 43 studies of abortion-related complications in areas where most abortions are unsafe (14 countries in Africa, 6 countries in Asia, 4 countries in Latin America) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

If untreated or inappropriately treated, infection can lead to sepsis, septic shock, organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and future sterility. Women may present with one or more of the following signs and symptoms anytime from minutes to days after the procedure: abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic pain, malodorous discharge, fever and chills, bleeding or spotting, and uterine or adnexal tenderness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18736887\"><span class=\"h2\">Incomplete abortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incomplete abortion is more common in self-induced abortion or abortion by an untrained provider, at later gestational ages, in the presence of uterine anomalies, or with distorting uterine pathology (eg, uterine leiomyomas).

In addition to injuries to the genital tract, perforation can result in trauma to the bowel and other internal organs. Ingestion of chemical agents can also cause trauma.</p><p>Vaginal and cervical lacerations generally present with overt vaginal bleeding; however, internal bleeding can mask the total estimated blood loss. Lacerations to the cervix and lateral uterus are particularly dangerous due to the risk of lacerating one of the vessels in the parametrial space. A vaginal or cervical laceration should be suspected in the setting of heavy vaginal bleeding with firm uterine tone.</p><p>Uterine perforation is the most common upper genital tract injury. Other sites of trauma from perforation include the fallopian tubes, ovaries, bowel, rectum, and bladder. Presenting signs and symptoms include vaginal bleeding, hemodynamic instability, and sepsis. In addition, the provider may suspect perforation based on findings during the procedure (eg, visualization of a laceration or internal organ, feeling an instrument perforate tissue, ability to insert instruments deep into the patient).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18736908\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemical burns or drug toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have used or been administered oral, parenteral, or local drugs or toxic substances for abortion induction or assistance in surgical abortion may have a variety of presentations, including local damage to the vagina or signs of renal or liver toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31294317\"><span class=\"h2\">Failed procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ongoing pregnancy may result from a botched abortion at an early gestational age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31294123\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the initial medical assessment of reproductive age women, the clinician should always consider the possibility of pregnancy. Following unsafe abortion, women may present to several different types of facilities, they may have a variety of presentations, and they may not reveal a history of recent abortion or even that they are or were pregnant.</p><p>When a woman presents with clinical findings related to the genital tract, providers in countries where abortion is legal may not consider the possibility of unsafe abortion, since it is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, this possibility should be considered in complicated or atypical cases, since standard approaches to management of gynecological disease may be inadequate in women who have been exposed internally to chemicals or nonsterile implements or who have ingested toxic substances. (See <a href=\"#H18736535\" class=\"local\">'Providers and performance of unsafe abortion'</a> above.)</p><p>In countries where abortion is restricted, complications from unsafe abortion are a common reason for hospital admission. For example, in Nigeria, unsafe complicated abortions accounted for 14 percent of gynecological admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In resource-limited settings, a major issue is triage to a facility with adequate resources to support the patient and manage her <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/surgical</span> needs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18242723\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial evaluation includes assessment of vital signs, gestational age, vaginal bleeding and total blood loss, vaginal discharge, and examination for signs of uterine infection (malodorous discharge, uterine tenderness, fever).

The amount of retained tissue is particularly difficult to estimate after unsafe abortion and is likely to be greater than after safe abortion. Antibiotics should be given prior to instrumentation. A variety of regimens is effective. It is important to use broad spectrum antibiotics that have anaerobic coverage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retained-products-of-conception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retained products of conception&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common clinical features of septic abortion include fever, chills, malaise, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and discharge, which is often sanguinopurulent. Physical examination may reveal tachycardia, tachypnea, lower abdominal tenderness, and a boggy, tender uterus with dilated cervix.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Infection is usually due to Staphylococcus aureus, Gram negative bacilli, or some Gram positive cocci. Mixed infections, anaerobic organisms, and fungi, can also be encountered. The infection may spread, leading to salpingitis, generalized peritonitis, and septicemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Antibiotic therapy and evacuation of the uterus are the mainstays of management. The route of antibiotic administration, oral versus parenteral, depends on degree of infection. Postabortal infections are typically polymicrobial and thus a broad-spectrum antibiotic is needed. An oral regimen is reasonable if the patient is clinically stable, not immunocompromised, does not have signs of a pelvic abscess, and will adhere to the regimen. An option for patients with mild to moderate pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is one dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a> 2 grams intramuscularly plus one dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a> 1 gram orally, followed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> 100 mg twice daily orally for 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. For patients with more severe cases, broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics are required until symptoms resolve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manifestations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> toxicity may include high fever, shaking chills, abdominal cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, tremor, agitation, confusion, rhabdomyolysis, hypoxemia, and hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/23-25,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25,32</a>]. Symptoms develop soon after ingestion, as misoprostol is rapidly absorbed (it is completely absorbed from the stomach 1.5 hours after ingestion). Treatment involves removing any remaining tablets from the vagina or stomach (eg, gavage) and supportive care until symptoms resolve, which takes about 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/23,25,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25,32,33</a>]. Management of rhabdomyolysis is discussed separately.

It is associated with prolonged fetal demise, excessive blood loss, and amniotic fluid embolism. DIC can be diagnosed by drawing a 10 cc tube of whole blood and assessing whether it forms a stable clot after 10 minutes without movement of the tube. Treatment involves fluid resuscitation, clotting factors, platelets, and blood transfusion, as necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31293484\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultimately, prevention of unsafe abortion requires a multipronged approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of unintended pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved access to and safety of abortion procedures </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provision of high-quality postabortion medical care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postabortion family planning counseling and contraceptive services</p><p/><p>Provision of contraception is the most important intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In the Russian Federation, Eastern Europe, and Central Asia, abortion levels declined steadily as the use of modern contraceptives increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Although a 2013 systematic review did not find conclusive evidence that post-abortion family planning counseling and services in low income countries significantly decreased maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">morbidity/mortality,</span> unintended pregnancy, or repeat abortion, the available evidence was sparse and low quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Studies in California and Helsinki have reported that postabortal intrauterine device (IUD) insertion decreased the rate of repeat abortion by over 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Expanded access to safe abortion is also critical. Liberalization of abortion laws resulted in increased access to safe abortion, most notably in Romania, where repeal of laws banning contraception and abortion was associated with a 50 percent fall in maternal mortality within one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In the United States, the number of abortion-related deaths fell after Roe v Wade in 1973: from almost 40 per million live births in 1970 to 8 per million live births in 1976, in part due to the increased availability of legal abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In Bangladesh, use of the safe, government sanctioned service of menstrual regulation establishing nonpregnancy after a missed period is associated with one-third the rate of complications of induced abortions: 120 per 1000 menstrual regulations versus 357 per 1000 induced abortions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Menstrual regulation is usually performed by Family Welfare Visitors (women trained to conduct childbirth) using manual vacuum extraction.</p><p>Victims of intimate partner violence are at risk for unintended pregnancy and abortion, as well as other health consequences. A study by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that reducing intimate partner violence by 50 percent could potentially reduce unintended pregnancy by 2 to 18 percent and abortion by 4.5 to 40 percent, according to population-attributable risk estimates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unsafe-abortion/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H847828034\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE-BASED RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization (WHO) provides global technical and policy guidance on the use of contraception to prevent unintended pregnancy, safe abortion, and treatment of complications from unsafe abortion.
