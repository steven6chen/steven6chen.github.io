Skin lesions include patches or plaques that may be localized or widespread, tumors, and erythroderma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SS is a distinctive erythrodermic CTCL with a leukemic involvement of malignant T cells clonally matching that in the skin. </p><p/><p>This group of disorders differs from other primary CTCLs by virtue of unique clinical features and histopathology. This topic review will discuss the staging, response criteria, and prognosis of MF and SS. The diagnosis and management of these disorders are discussed separately.

The standard staging evaluation includes a careful examination of the skin (especially the scalp, palms, soles, and perineum) with skin biopsy, a complete blood count with S&eacute;zary cell analysis, screening chemistries including lactate dehydrogenase, and a chest x-ray (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75528\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75528 \">table 2</a>). Lymph node biopsies, not fine needle aspirations, are obtained if lymphadenopathy is present, since lymph node involvement affects both the stage and prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1118886\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin evaluation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4122851\"><span class=\"h3\">Total body skin examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should undergo a total body skin examination (TBSE) including the scalp, face, neck, oral mucosa and cavity, all four extremities, trunk, abdomen, buttocks, hands, and feet. If the patient endorses symptoms in the genitalia, those areas should be included (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-early-detection-of-melanoma-in-adults-and-adolescents#H1530613701\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and early detection of melanoma in adults and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Clinician total body skin examination'</a>). When performing the TBSE, skin lesions are classified as patches, papules, plaques, or tumors according to the following definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patch &ndash; Any size lesion without induration or significant elevation above the surrounding uninvolved skin; poikiloderma (ie, mottled pigmentation, epidermal atrophy, and telangiectasia associated with slight infiltration) may be present</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plaque &ndash; Any size lesion that is elevated or indurated; crusting, ulceration, or poikiloderma may be present</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor &ndash; Any solid or nodular lesions &ge;1 cm in diameter with evidence of deep infiltration in the skin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vertical growth</p><p/><p>Clinicians should make special note of signs of <span class=\"nowrap\">follicular/folliculotropic</span> disease such as follicular <span class=\"nowrap\">prominence/accentuation,</span> hair <span class=\"nowrap\">loss/alopecia,</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">comedonal/cystic</span> lesions. Evidence of ulceration should be noted and whether pigment alteration is due to active disease (eg, hypopigmented or vitiliginous variant of MF) or from post-inflammatory discoloration associated with inactive disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4122858\"><span class=\"h3\">Percent body surface area estimates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The percentage of body surface area (BSA) involved by each type of lesion (eg, patch, plaque, tumor) should be estimated and recorded. Areas of alopecia are included in the BSA only if they are thought to be manifestations of disease, such as seen in patients with the folliculotropic variant of MF. If tumors are present, the total number, aggregate volume, size of the largest lesion, and involved body regions should be noted. Methods of measuring percentage BSA have been adapted from studies in patients with burns. BSA measurement in patients with burns is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-burn-injury#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of burn injury&quot;, section on 'Extent of burn injury'</a>.)</p><p>Several methods are available to calculate the estimated percentage BSA involved. Smaller areas are most easily measured using the &quot;palm method,&quot; while larger areas are more easily measured using an estimation of BSA for specific body regions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;palm method&quot; &ndash; This method uses the palm of the patient's hand, excluding the fingers, as approximately 0.5 percent of total BSA and the entire palmar surface including fingers as 1 percent BSA in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;rule of nines&quot; &ndash; The &quot;rule of nines&quot; is a quick method of estimating total BSA in adults in which each leg represents 18 percent total BSA, each arm represents 9 percent total BSA, the anterior and posterior trunk each represent 18 percent total BSA, and the head represents 9 percent total BSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Lund-Browder chart &ndash; The Lund-Browder chart is the most accurate method for estimating percentage total BSA for both adults and children and takes into account the relative percentage of body surface area affected by growth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71190 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>The percent of total BSA involved may be underestimated in women with involvement of the anterior trunk and large breasts. For every increase in cup size, the total BSA of a woman's anterior trunk increases by a factor of 0.1, relative to the posterior trunk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4122865\"><span class=\"h3\">Disease severity estimates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scoring systems have been developed to measure disease severity. Global scoring systems provide an objective measure of overall disease burden designed to assess the efficacy of a systemic therapy (eg, systemic retinoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=romidepsin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">romidepsin</a>). In contrast, a local skin scoring system provides a measure of the severity of an individual lesion and may be used to assess the efficacy of a local therapy (eg, topical corticosteroids). Global scoring systems include the severity weight assessment tool (SWAT) score and the modified SWAT (mSWAT) score; these measures may also be used to score individual skin lesions. Alternatively, the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score can be used for local skin scoring.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>SWAT and mSWAT</strong> &ndash; The mSWAT score provides a global measure of disease severity by incorporating information regarding the percentage of total body surface area (BSA) involved by each type of skin lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F83963\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83963 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The percentage of involved BSA is then multiplied by a weight according to lesion type (ie, patch = 1, plaque = 2, tumor = 3 or 4). These scores were designed to reflect the increase in dermal infiltrate thickness (and disease burden) with tumor versus plaque versus patch lesions. Individual lesions can also be scored using the SWAT and mSWAT criteria by multiplying the percentage of total BSA involved by an individual lesion by the weight assigned to the lesion type.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CAILS </strong>&ndash; The CAILS score is used to assess disease severity of an individual lesion. This method rates each of five characteristics (ie, erythema, scaling, plaque elevation, hypo- or hyperpigmentation if reflective of active disease, and size) on a scale from 1 to 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The CAILS score is a sum of the rating given to each of these criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F83962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83962 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p>Widespread use of each of these scoring systems in clinical practice is limited by substantial interobserver variability due to the subjectivity of many of the measures. Ideally, the same clinician should be responsible for determining serial scores for each patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90634513\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The peripheral blood can be evaluated for S&eacute;zary cells with either a buffy coat preparation (ie, &quot;S&eacute;zary cell&quot; prep) or flow cytometry. When a S&eacute;zary cell prep is used, B<sub>0</sub> is defined as &le;5 percent S&eacute;zary <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> of total lymphocytes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-sezary-syndrome#H63648001\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, and diagnosis of S&eacute;zary syndrome&quot;, section on 'Peripheral blood'</a>.)</p><p>Evaluation of the peripheral blood using flow cytometry has not been validated. However, consensus guidelines suggest that, when flow cytometry is used, B<sub>0</sub> is defined as either &lt;250 S&eacute;zary <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> OR &lt;15 percent CD4+CD7- or CD4+CD26- of total CD4+ lymphocytes. The peripheral blood T cell clone should be identical to that identified in the involved skin. All of the definitions of B<sub>0</sub> are in line with normal values in the blood. B2 is defined as a clonal rearrangement of the TCR in the blood and one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;1000/microL</span> S&eacute;zary cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased CD4+ or CD3+ cells with <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/CD8</span> &ge;10</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in CD4+ cells with an abnormal phenotype (&gt;40 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4+/CD7-</span> or &gt;30 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4+/CD26-</span> of lymphocytes)</p><p/><p>The presence of a significant number of S&eacute;zary cells in the peripheral blood (B<sub>1 </sub>or B<sub>2</sub>) generally correlates with more extensive skin lesions (usually T<sub>4</sub>) and the presence of extracutaneous disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. As an example, in an analysis of 1263 patients with MF or SS, which included 199 patients with B<sub>1</sub> or B<sub>2</sub> disease, patients with a significant number of S&eacute;zary cells in the peripheral blood had a worse overall and disease-specific survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The survival of patients with B<sub>2</sub> disease was worse than that of patients with B<sub>1</sub> disease (median overall survival 4.64 years versus not reached; hazard ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.01-0.80).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1118893\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies are included in the staging workup based on the extent and type of skin involvement and if lymph node, viscera, and blood involvement is suspected or present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As always, care should be taken to limit radiation exposure, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns regarding the risk for second malignancies. In asymptomatic, otherwise healthy patients with apparently early stage (T<sub>1</sub>N<sub>0</sub>B<sub>0</sub> or T<sub>2a</sub>N<sub>0</sub>B<sub>0</sub>) MF, any imaging study is optional. Further imaging is reserved for patients with &ge;T<sub>2b</sub> skin lesions, palpable adenopathy, abnormal laboratory studies, or pathology consistent with large cell transformed MF or folliculotropic MF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For these patients, we perform a contrast-enhanced (diagnostic) computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis or a whole-body integrated positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scan. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be substituted for patients who are unable to safely undergo CT.</p><p>There is a paucity of data regarding the sensitivity and specificity of CT and PET scans in the staging of MF and SS. Visceral disease is highly unusual in the absence of significant blood or nodal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In an initial study of 62 patients with newly diagnosed MF or SS, 85 percent of whom had apparently early stage disease, CT imaging did not improve upon staging with physical examination and routine lymph node biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a subsequent case series of 13 patients with MF or SS at risk for secondary lymph node involvement, integrated whole body <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanning was more sensitive in detecting lymph node involvement than were physical examination or CT scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The intensity of PET activity loosely correlated with the histologic grade of the removed nodes, and was highest in those with large cell transformation.</p><p>Suspected sites of visceral involvement other than the liver or spleen must be confirmed by histologic evaluation when possible. Given the potential morbidity associated with biopsy, imaging studies are sufficient to demonstrate liver or spleen involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1118900\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymph node biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients with MF or SS require lymph node biopsy as part of staging. Lymph node biopsy is reserved for patients with discernable lymphadenopathy by clinical examination or imaging study. If present, a lymph node &ge;1.5 cm in diameter <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a lymph node that is firm, irregular, clustered, or fixed or with significant metabolic activity should undergo biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Excisional biopsy is always preferable; however in some cases image-guided core biopsy may be acceptable in order to minimize morbidity of an excisional biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If there is more than one suspicious lymph node, biopsy preference is given to lymph nodes draining an area of involved skin or the node with the highest standardized uptake value on FDG-PET scan. If there are multiple suspicious nodes that otherwise seem equivalent by those measures, the order of biopsy preference is: cervical, axillary, and then inguinal.</p><p>The degree of lymph node replacement by atypical cells can be described as a grade that has prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">ISCL/EORTC</span> lymph node classification system reflects the degree of infiltration by these atypical cells in clinically enlarged lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are classified as N<sub>1</sub> through N<sub>3</sub>, ranging from &quot;no atypical lymphocytes&quot; of N<sub>0</sub> to &quot;complete replacement of nodal architecture by atypical lymphocytes or frank neoplastic cells&quot; of N<sub>3</sub>. These nodal staging systems are then further subclassified by the absence (a) or presence (b) of clonal cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1118907\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant bone marrow involvement with an infiltrative histologic pattern is most often present in patients who meet the clinical criteria for SS. These patients have readily detectable S&eacute;zary cells in the peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As a result, bone marrow biopsy is not routinely employed as part of the initial staging procedure for patients with MF. However, it may be useful in selected cases to document visceral disease if marrow involvement is suspected, such as in the setting of B<sub>2</sub> blood involvement or in patients with an unexplained hematologic abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1118914\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The course of mycosis fungoides (MF) and S&eacute;zary syndrome (SS) is variable. Some patients have limited skin-only disease that waxes and wanes over decades. Others with more generalized thick skin involvement, true folliculotropic disease, or multiple tumors are more prone to disease progression or develop extracutaneous involvement and have a worse prognosis. The main predictor of outcomes in MF is the overall clinical stage, as defined by the TNMB criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75768%7EHEME%2F53711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75768 graphicRef53711 \">table 1A-B</a>) (see <a href=\"#H90634137\" class=\"local\">'TNMB criteria'</a> above). </p><p>Other factors associated with a worse prognosis include transformation to large cell histology (LCT). The presence of folliculotropic disease may have more prognostic significance in early stage MF; however, as in advanced stage MF or SS, other adverse parameters such as LCT, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and presence of extracutaneous involvement have a greater impact in the clinical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The proposed cutaneous lymphoma international prognosis index (CLIPi) incorporates each of these factors, but requires further validation in prospective studies before it is applied to the general population. (See <a href=\"#H15347854\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic indices'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17931806\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of disease stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TNMB classification is the strongest prognostic factor in MF and is determined based upon the involvement of the skin (T), lymph nodes (N), viscera (M), and blood (B) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75768%7EHEME%2F53711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75768 graphicRef53711 \">table 1A-B</a>). Of the factors that go into determining the clinical stage, the extent and type of skin involvement (T-stage) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54376\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54376 \">figure 2</a>) and presence of extracutaneous disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74471\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74471 \">figure 3</a>) are the most important indicators predictive of survival. Consistent with this, patients with SS have a worse prognosis than erythrodermic patients with MF who do not have the other findings of the SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Most prognostic factors for MF have not been evaluated in a prospective trial.

The clinical course varies from indolent to aggressive behavior. S&eacute;zary syndrome (SS) is a more aggressive leukemic variant of cutaneous T cell lymphoma in which a significant number of circulating malignant (S&eacute;zary) cells are observed in the peripheral blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The standard staging system for MF and SS is based upon an evaluation of the skin (T), lymph nodes (N), visceral involvement (M), and blood (B) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75768%7EHEME%2F53711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75768 graphicRef53711 \">table 1A-B</a>). This includes a comprehensive skin examination with biopsy, a complete blood count with S&eacute;zary cell analysis, screening chemistries, and LDH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75528\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75528 \">table 2</a>). Computed tomography with or without positron emission tomography is indicated for patients with more advanced clinical disease or with adverse histologic factors (eg, large cell transformation). Lymph node biopsies are obtained if lymphadenopathy is present. Bone marrow biopsy may be useful in selected cases to document visceral disease. (See <a href=\"#H1118879\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As expected, the prognosis of MF and SS varies with disease stage. Patients with limited <span class=\"nowrap\">patch/plaque</span> disease have an excellent prognosis with an overall long-term life expectancy that is similar to an age-, sex-, and race-matched control population. Patients with generalized <span class=\"nowrap\">patch/plaque</span> disease also have a relatively good prognosis with a median survival greater than 10 years. Median survivals drop to approximately four years in patients with cutaneous tumors or generalized erythroderma. Patients with extracutaneous disease at presentation involving either lymph nodes or viscera have a median survival of 13 months. (See <a href=\"#H1118914\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with histologic demonstration of large cell transformation have a worse outcome than those with other variants of MF. Folliculotropic MF is associated with greater risk of disease progression and, in a subset of patients (especially early stage MF), is associated with worse survival outcome. For this reason, patients with folliculotropic MF or large cell transformation may benefit from a more intensive treatment approach. (See <a href=\"#H1118949\" class=\"local\">'Transformation to large cell histology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15348425\" class=\"local\">'Folliculotropic variant'</a> above.) &#160;</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-mycosis-fungoides-and-sezary-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Olsen E, Vonderheid E, Pimpinelli N, et al.
