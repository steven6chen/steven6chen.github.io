People sometimes also call this &quot;prescription drug abuse.&quot;</p><p>Prescription drug misuse can have a bad impact on important parts of a person's life. For example, it might cause the person to miss work or school, or have problems getting along with friends or family.</p><p>People who misuse prescription drugs might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take drugs that are not prescribed to them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take more of the drug than what the label says</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crush pills and inhale them, or inject them into a vein instead of swallowing them as directed</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515753\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the most commonly misused prescription drugs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The types of prescription drugs that people misuse most often are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80775\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80775 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain drugs to treat severe pain (called &quot;opioids&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs that make you feel alert and focused (called &quot;stimulants&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs that make you feel calm, relaxed, or possibly sleepy (called &quot;anxiolytics&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515770\"><span class=\"h1\">What are common signs that a person might be misusing prescription drugs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Warning signs of prescription drug misuse include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden changes in mood or behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being more irritable than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being more sleepy than normal</p><p/><p>People who misuse prescription drugs might tell their doctor they need more medicine than they actually do. That way, they can get more of the drug they are misusing. They might also try to get the same prescription medicine from more than one doctor. Some people order drugs on the internet, too.</p><p>But most people who misuse prescription drugs get them from a friend or relative, not a doctor.</p><p>Prescription drug misuse is common among teenagers. Often, teens take drugs from their parents' medicine cabinet. Other times, they get the drugs from other teens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515793\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are worried that you have a problem with drugs, talk to your doctor or nurse, or to a mental health counselor. They can recommend treatments to help you overcome your problem.</p><p>If you think someone close to you is misusing prescription drugs, ask them if they are taking medicines differently from how they are meant to be taken. If they are, encourage them to speak to the doctor who prescribed the drugs. You can also ask your own doctor or counselor for advice.</p><p>If you think your child is misusing prescription drugs, talk to his or her doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515808\"><span class=\"h1\">How is prescription drug misuse treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major treatment for prescription drug misuse is counseling. In counseling, you can talk with a doctor or other specialist about how to stop misusing drugs. There are medicines that can help treat addiction to some prescription drugs.</p><p>Other treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescription medicines that make it easier to stop misusing drugs. Medicines like these are available only for some types of drug misuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Support groups, such as Narcotics Anonymous. In support groups, people talk about their drug use and share advice on how to quit.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515823\"><span class=\"h1\">What is withdrawal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When people take drugs for a long time and suddenly stop or reduce the dose sharply, they often get symptoms. These symptoms are called &quot;withdrawal,&quot; and might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling anxious or restless</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p/><p>If you have any of these symptoms after stopping a drug, talk with your doctor or nurse. He or she can prescribe medicines to treat these symptoms or suggest ways to help you cope. Medicines can prevent more severe symptoms, such as seizures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1955053269\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to prevent someone from dying of a drug overdose?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you think someone might be having a drug overdose, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p>There is a medicine called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naloxone</a>&quot; that can treat people who overdose on opioids. (Opioids include heroin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">morphine</a>, and certain prescription pain medicines.) Signs of an opioid overdose include extreme sleepiness, slow breathing or no breathing, a slow heartbeat, and very small pupils. If you or someone in your house misuses opioids or is trying to stop using them, you might want to keep naloxone at home. Naloxone is available by prescription in the US and some other countries. It comes as a nasal spray (brand name: Narcan nasal spray) or a shot made simple so that anyone can give it (brand name: Evzio).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Naloxone</a> only works for opioid overdose. It will not help a person who has overdosed on a different drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10515840\"><span class=\"h1\">Can prescription drug misuse be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To reduce the chances that you will misuse drugs, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicine only as prescribed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Read the instructions from the pharmacist before taking your medicine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor or pharmacist about your medicine if you are unsure about how it will affect you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once your health problem is better, get rid of any leftover pills that were prescribed to treat the problem. This might involve flushing them down the toilet, or mixing them with something like dirt or cat litter before putting the mixture in the trash. Some police stations and pharmacies also take unused or leftover medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1129541\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioids-for-short-term-treatment-of-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Opioids for short-term treatment of pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-use-disorder-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Opioid use disorder (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
