It hangs down from the large intestine, which is also called the colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F81580\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81580 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395345\"><span class=\"h1\">What is appendicitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appendicitis is the name for when the appendix gets infected and inflamed. If that happens, it can swell and in some cases burst. That's dangerous, because a burst appendix can cause infection in the belly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395352\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of appendicitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe pain in the lower part of the belly, on the right side. (For many people, the pain starts near the belly button and then moves to the lower right side.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p>Some people can have different symptoms, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach upset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a lot of gas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irregular bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling ill</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395359\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for appendicitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse can run tests that can help him or her find the cause of your symptoms. But if you do have appendicitis, he or she will probably be able to diagnose it just by doing an exam. Your doctor or nurse can learn a lot about your condition by pressing on your belly and talking with you about your symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395366\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Call your doctor or nurse right away if you have the symptoms listed above. The risk of your appendix bursting is much higher after the first 24 hours of symptoms. If the appendix bursts, the surgery to treat it will be more complicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395373\"><span class=\"h1\">How is appendicitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment for appendicitis is surgery to remove the appendix. This surgery can be done in 2 ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Open surgery</strong> &ndash; During an open surgery, the doctor makes a cut near the appendix that is big enough to pull the appendix through.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laparoscopic surgery</strong> &ndash; During laparoscopic surgery, the doctor makes a few cuts that are much smaller than those used in open surgery. Then he or she inserts long, thin tools into the belly. One of the tools has a camera (called a &quot;laparoscope&quot;) on the end, which sends pictures to a TV screen. The doctor can look at the image on the screen to know where to cut and what to remove. Then he or she uses the long tools to do the surgery.</p><p/><p>If your appendix has burst, your surgery will probably be more complicated than it would be if it had not burst. Your doctor will need to wash away the material that spills out when an appendix bursts. As a result, your cuts might be larger or you might spend more time in surgery.</p><p>If it has been a few days since your appendix burst, your doctor might decide not to do surgery at all. That's because the body sometimes forms a wall inside the belly, to block off the area that became infected when the appendix burst. In a case like this, doctors usually give antibiotics and carefully watch the person. They might be able to avoid doing surgery right away, since it can be more difficult in people who fit this description. But many people will need surgery later to take out the appendix.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395380\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant and think you have signs of appendicitis, make sure you tell your doctors that you are pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3292292\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=appendicitis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Appendicitis in children (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
