Status epilepticus manifests as many different syndromes, each defined by distinctive clinical features and EEG findings. Causes, prognoses, and treatments differ, and optimal evaluation and treatment requires an understanding of both the type of status epilepticus and the underlying cause. Some forms of status epilepticus have an excellent prognosis, whereas others are associated with major morbidity or even mortality.</p><p>The definition, classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of convulsive status epilepticus in adults are reviewed separately.

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus and the diagnosis and management of status epilepticus in children are discussed separately.

GCSE is operationally defined as &ge;5 minutes of continuous seizure activity, or more than one seizure without recovery in between [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H17916977\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Convulsive status epilepticus in adults: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p>Many possible pharmacologic approaches have been developed empirically, but there are few controlled trials comparing different regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The approach outlined below is generally consistent with consensus-based guidelines published by the Neurocritical Care Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Initial management is divided into three phases: assessment and supportive treatment; initial pharmacologic therapy with a benzodiazepine; and urgent therapy that achieves long-term control using a nonbenzodiazepine antiseizure drug such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosphenytoin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74649\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74649 \">algorithm 1</a>). Despite initial treatment, approximately 20 percent of patients develop refractory status epilepticus and require additional therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2329061388\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapid assessment and support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rapid neurologic examination should be performed to determine of the type of status epilepticus and, if possible, its etiology. A focused general medical evaluation should assess respiratory and circulatory status. Attention to airway, breathing, and circulation is urgent, as in other medical emergencies. Supportive therapy (eg, oxygen, mechanical ventilation) should be instituted as necessary. Measurement of arterial blood gases is often valuable, as most patients with GCSE who do not respond rapidly to initial treatment require intubation and mechanical ventilation.</p><p>Intravenous (IV) catheters should be placed and blood obtained for electrolytes including calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium, serum glucose, liver function tests, a complete blood count, toxicology studies, and antiseizure drug levels, as appropriate. A rapid fingerstick glucose should also be obtained. Cardiac monitoring, frequent measurement of blood pressure, and pulse oximetry should be instituted. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thiamine</a> (100 mg) and dextrose (50 mL of 50 percent dextrose solution) should be considered. These tasks require at least one to five minutes and should overlap with the next phase of treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74649\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74649 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Neuromuscular blocking agents are often used to facilitate rapid intubation, but they can abolish the motor manifestations of seizures and thus mask ongoing status epilepticus. They are not a treatment for status epilepticus. Alternative agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> or thiopental, are therefore preferred to facilitate rapid intubation. When neuromuscular blocking agents are used, EEG monitoring is mandatory in order to know whether status epilepticus has resolved or is continuing and needs further treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction agents for rapid sequence intubation in adults outside the operating room&quot;, section on 'Status epilepticus'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2329061394\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial pharmacologic therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1392003052\"><span class=\"h3\">When IV access is available</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment for GCSE. In addition, treatment with a nonbenzodiazepine antiseizure drug is recommended to prevent recurrence, even if convulsions have ceased following benzodiazepine treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among the antiseizure drugs that can be loaded intravenously, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosphenytoin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> have been preferred for most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Small randomized trials also support the use of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a>, but these trials are limited by modest power to detect differences between the drugs. To address the question of which drug, if any, should be preferred, the National Institutes of Health has funded an adequately-powered, randomized controlled trial (ESETT) comparing fosphenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].

Phenytoin (but not fosphenytoin) and any of the benzodiazepines are incompatible and will precipitate if infused through the same intravenous line; the same applies to phenytoin and any fluid with <span class=\"nowrap\">glucose/dextrose</span>. An additional dose (5 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">PE/kg</span> fosphenytoin or 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> phenytoin) can be given 10 minutes after the loading infusion if seizures persist.

On arrival to hospital, patients receiving IM midazolam had a higher rate of seizure control (73 versus 63 percent) than patients receiving IV lorazepam.

Regardless of the specifics of pharmacologic therapy, it is critical to provide adequate ventilatory and hemodynamic support. Patients with refractory status epilepticus should be intubated and monitored with continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The primary drugs used for refractory status epilepticus are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentobarbital</a> (or thiopental in some countries). A systematic review of drug therapy for refractory status epilepticus assessed data on 193 patients from 28 trials in an attempt to compare efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Pentobarbital was much more effective than either propofol or midazolam in preventing breakthrough seizures (12 versus 42 percent), but was associated with a significantly increased incidence of hypotension, defined as a systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg (77 versus 34 percent). Overall mortality was 48 percent, but there was no association between drug selection and the risk of death. Another study of 107 patients failed to show an influence of the therapy used on the outcome of refractory status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In a small randomized study that was stopped early due to slow accrual, barbiturates and propofol were associated with similar rates of seizure control and hypotension, but patients receiving barbiturates had significantly longer mechanical ventilation times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>It should be noted that most <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentobarbital</a> trials were before 1995, usually included only intermittent EEG recordings, and typically aimed for a burst suppression or more suppressed EEG background as the goal of treatment.

Consequently, the available data are probably not comparing equally effective doses of these drugs. It is possible that pentobarbital would cause less hypotension if not titrated to such a suppressed EEG, while propofol and midazolam might lead to fewer relapses if used more aggressively, although possibly causing more hypotension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2329061487\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors to consider when selecting pharmacologic therapy for refractory status epilepticus include the urgency of seizure control (based on the underlying illness and the type and duration of seizure activity), the pharmacokinetics of various drugs (especially the rapidity of anticonvulsant effect), drugs already used and failed, and potential complications of treatment, especially hypotension and the risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74649\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74649 \">algorithm 1</a>).

On the other hand, longer infusions and higher doses of propofol may precipitate the propofol infusion syndrome (see <a href=\"#H2329061499\" class=\"local\">'Propofol'</a> below).

One study of patients on pentobarbital raised the possibility that a prolonged period of seizure and EEG suppression might be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>].</p><p>It is critical that high therapeutic levels of at least one longer-acting antiseizure drug be maintained before tapering continuous infusions.

Breakthrough seizures usually warrant an increase in treatment. It is common practice to re-treat with higher doses of the continuous infusional treatment, or for longer at doses that were successful earlier, and then have additional antiseizure drugs (or higher levels of earlier antiseizure drugs) on board before the next attempt at tapering.

Comprehensive neuropsychologic evaluations before and after status epilepticus are seldom available. It is difficult to control for many variables, and many neurologic deficits fluctuate. It is also unclear whether the underlying illness or status epilepticus itself causes morbidity, and patients with progressive illnesses worsen, whether or not related to the status epilepticus.

The typical loading dose of IV lorazepam for status epilepticus is 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, infused at a maximum rate of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/min,</span> allowing one minute to assess the effect before deciding whether additional doses are necessary. An alternative to a weight-based initial loading dose of lorazepam is a 4 mg fixed dose, repeated if still seizing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to benzodiazepines, we recommend a loading dose of a longer-acting antiseizure drug in order to maintain seizure control (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosphenytoin</a> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> equivalents [PE]) in most patients rather than alternative antiseizure drugs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Valproic acid (20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> (40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> maximum 4500 mg) are reasonable alternatives, particularly in patients with phenytoin hypersensitivity or a history of primary generalized epilepsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74649\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74649 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2329061394\" class=\"local\">'Initial pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients who are actively seizing despite two initial doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> or other benzodiazepine, preparation for a continuous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> infusion should occur simultaneously with administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosphenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosphenytoin</a>, valproic acid, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a>, since the primary role of the nonbenzodiazepine antiseizure drug is to prevent recurrence rather than to break the seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the prehospital setting or if IV access is delayed or impossible, intramuscular (IM) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (10 mg for adults) is an effective alternative to IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>. Nasal or buccal midazolam (0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> maximum 10 mg) is also a reasonable, although less well studied, option in adults. (See <a href=\"#H1392003161\" class=\"local\">'Out-of-hospital/prehospital treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients begin to recover responsiveness within 10 to 20 minutes after generalized convulsions, but there is a broad range. The two most common reasons for prolonged postictal recovery are sedation due to medications and the continuation of (nonconvulsive) seizures; these can be impossible to distinguish clinically. All patients with seizures or status epilepticus who do not return to a normal level of consciousness after initial treatment should therefore be monitored by EEG to determine whether treatment was adequate or if the patient is still seizing. (See <a href=\"#H2329061469\" class=\"local\">'Postictal recovery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the postictal recovery period it is also important to repeat a full neurologic examination, looking for asymmetric or focal findings that may suggest clues to the underlying etiology. A head CT or MRI should be obtained once seizures are controlled. A lumbar puncture (LP) is warranted if the clinical presentation is suggestive of an acute infectious process that involves the central nervous system, or if the patient has a history of a malignancy and there is concern for metastasis to the meninges. (See <a href=\"#H2329061475\" class=\"local\">'Secondary assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are many possible approaches to the treatment of refractory status epilepticus. Treatment typically includes a continuous infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentobarbital</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74649\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74649 \">algorithm 1</a>). Factors to consider when selecting pharmacologic therapy for refractory status epilepticus include the urgency of seizure control (based on the underlying illness and the type and duration of seizure activity), the pharmacokinetics of various drugs (especially the rapidity of anticonvulsant effect), drugs already used and failed, and potential complications of treatment, especially hypotension and the risk of prolonged mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H2329061481\" class=\"local\">'Refractory status epilepticus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EEG monitoring is critical during the treatment of refractory status epilepticus in order to confirm that seizures have been treated adequately, guide use of antiseizure drugs and assess the level of suppression achieved, and monitor for relapse of seizures as infusions are tapered. (See <a href=\"#H2329061517\" class=\"local\">'EEG monitoring and goals of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal duration of treatment for refractory status epilepticus is not well established. In general, infusions are typically continued for 24 hours of clinical and electrographic seizure suppression and then gradually tapered over 12 to 24 hours. (See <a href=\"#H2329061523\" class=\"local\">'Duration of continuous infusions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis depends most strongly on the underlying etiology, but there is some evidence that status epilepticus is independently associated with mortality and neurologic sequelae.
