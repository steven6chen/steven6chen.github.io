The liver is a big organ in the upper right side of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a>). Damage to the liver can cause heavy bleeding, swelling, and breathing problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780476\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of cirrhosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with cirrhosis have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the belly and legs, and fluid buildup in the lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy bleeding from blood vessels in the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising or bleeding easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling full</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble getting enough sleep or sleeping too much</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, called jaundice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion that can come on suddenly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coma</p><p/><p>Cirrhosis also makes it more likely that you will get infections, and it can increase your risk of liver cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780483\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes cirrhosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When something harms the liver, the organ tries to fix itself. In the process, scars form. Causes of liver damage include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy alcohol use &ndash; People who abuse alcohol or who are addicted to it are most at risk for cirrhosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B or hepatitis C &ndash; Viruses cause these liver diseases. People can catch the viruses by sharing needles or having sex with people who are infected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) &ndash; People with this condition often don't drink alcohol. Doctors aren't sure what causes NASH, but many people who have it are overweight and have diabetes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780490\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for cirrhosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; In this test, a doctor puts a needle into your liver and takes out a small sample of tissue. The sample will show how severe the damage is.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; Results can show what is causing the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging &ndash; Your doctor might take pictures of your liver with an ultrasound machine or with a MRI.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780497\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to prevent further liver damage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help protect your liver:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid alcohol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talk to your doctor before you start taking any new medicines, including pain killers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol). Also talk to your doctor before taking any herbs, vitamins, or supplements. Some medicines and supplements can damage the liver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get vaccinated against hepatitis A and B if you have not had the infections before</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780504\"><span class=\"h1\">How is cirrhosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments depend on the cause of cirrhosis, how severe it is, and what symptoms you have. Treatments fall into a few main categories, including those that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treat the cause of the disease</strong> &ndash; Some causes of cirrhosis can be treated. For example, people with cirrhosis caused by alcohol abuse can try to stop drinking. People with chronic hepatitis C or B can take medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower the risk of bleeding</strong> &ndash; Cirrhosis can cause the blood vessels around the esophagus to swell or even burst and bleed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63611 \">figure 2</a>). To prevent that from happening, doctors can:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prescribe medicines called &quot;beta blockers.&quot; These medicines reduce blood pressure in the liver, and help reduce the chance of bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Place tiny bands around the swollen blood vessels (this procedure is called &quot;variceal band ligation&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decrease fluid buildup in the belly</strong> &ndash; In people with cirrhosis, the belly sometimes fills with fluid. To decrease fluid buildup, doctors can:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prescribe medicines called &quot;diuretics.&quot; These medicines make you urinate a lot. People who take diuretic medicines often must also reduce the amount of salt they eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drain the fluid from your belly using a needle (this procedure is called a &quot;paracentesis&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Implant a device in the liver that reduces fluid buildup in the belly (this procedure is called &quot;TIPS&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treat or prevent infection</strong> &ndash; People with cirrhosis have a higher than normal chance of getting infections. When they get an infection, they can also get much sicker than people without cirrhosis. As a result, people with cirrhosis sometimes need antibiotics to either treat or prevent infection. Most people with cirrhosis should also get the flu vaccine and other vaccines to prevent common infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treat confusion</strong> &ndash; Advanced cirrhosis can lead to confusion. Doctors usually use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lactulose</a> (a medicine that softens stool) or certain antibiotics to treat the confusion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780511\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need a new liver?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with severe cirrhosis need a new liver. Talk to your doctor about the surgery before you get too sick, to find out if a liver transplant might be an option for you. People often have to wait for up to 2 years to get a new liver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459780518\"><span class=\"h1\">Can cirrhosis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting cirrhosis by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting help if you have an alcohol problem</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting the vaccines for hepatitis B and hepatitis A, if you haven't already</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using condoms when having sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not sharing drug needles</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4728001\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol use &mdash; when is drinking a problem?
