High blood pressure is also called hypertension. Although hypertension is more common in adults, it often develops during childhood and adolescence, and can increase the risk of early heart disease and stroke during adulthood. Fortunately, high blood pressure is easy to measure and can be treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS BLOOD PRESSURE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An individual's blood pressure is defined by two measurements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries produced when the heart contracts (at the time of a heartbeat).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries during relaxation of the heart between heartbeats.</p><p/><p>Blood pressure is reported as the systolic blood pressure over diastolic blood pressure (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">120/70</span> or 120 over 70). The diagnosis of high blood pressure can be based upon either measurement as they are of equal importance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal versus high blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, the normal range for blood pressure is determined by the child's gender, age, and height. The normal range is expressed as a percentile, similar to charts used to track children's growth.</p><p>As an example, if a child's blood pressure is in the 60<sup>th</sup> percentile, this means that 60 percent of other children who are that age, gender, and height have a lower blood pressure.</p><p>A child's blood pressure percentile can be calculated here for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-boys-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or here for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-girls-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>).</p><p>Blood pressure is separated into three categories based upon the child's blood pressure percentile:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure &lt;90<sup>th</sup> percentile.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1130741763\"><span class=\"h3\">Elevated blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic blood pressure &ge;90<sup>th</sup> percentile but &lt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile <strong>or</strong> if blood pressure exceeds <span class=\"nowrap\">120/80</span> mmHg (even if &lt;90<sup>th</sup> percentile for age, gender, and height).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension is defined as either systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic blood pressure &ge;95<sup>th</sup> percentile measured on three or more separate occasions, <strong>or</strong> if blood pressure exceeds <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A slow increase in blood pressure does not usually cause any symptoms. However, a sudden increase in blood pressure in children and adolescents can cause headache, vomiting, seizures, or heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expert groups recommend that all children over age three years have their blood pressure measured during routine office visits at least once per year. Blood pressure measurements may be recommended at an earlier age in children who have kidney or heart disease, or present with any of the above-mentioned symptoms that could indicate hypertension.</p><p>It is important for the health care provider to measure the blood pressure accurately, using the correct equipment and technique. Manual measurement gives more accurate reading than digital machines, which can be used for screening BP. Parents should be aware of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The blood pressure should be measured after the child has been sitting in a quiet environment for a few minutes. The child should be seated with <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> back and feet in a supported position. In infants, blood pressure is measured while the child lies on <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> back. It may be necessary to measure the blood pressure a few times (several minutes apart) to get the most accurate reading.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The blood pressure should not be measured if the child is crying or unable to cooperate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An appropriate-size cuff should be used. A cuff that is too small can overestimate the blood pressure, and a larger cuff may give a lower reading.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood pressure should be measured in the right arm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulants such as cigarettes and caffeine should be avoided for several hours before the blood pressure is measured.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with no symptoms, the diagnosis of hypertension is made when the blood pressure is at or greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile on three separate measurements, which are separated by days or weeks. Waiting period with repeat measurements is not necessary in those with symptoms or clinical signs of hypertension.</p><p>When hypertension is diagnosed, testing is recommended to help determine the cause of the hypertension. The evaluation generally includes a medical history and physical examination, measurement of blood pressure in the arms and legs, laboratory tests, and an ultrasound of the heart and kidneys.</p><p>It is important to identify children with elevated blood pressure (blood pressure that is higher than normal but is not yet hypertension, formerly called &quot;prehypertension&quot;) in order to prevent progression to hypertension. Some children with elevated blood pressure may be candidates for treatment, such as those with chronic kidney disease, cardiac problems, or diabetes mellitus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a child is diagnosed with high blood pressure, the next step is to determine if a cause of the hypertension can be determined. Patients in whom no cause can be identified by history, physical examination or laboratory tests have primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension), and those with an identifiable cause have secondary hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary hypertension has no identifiable cause. It is the most common cause of hypertension in older children and adults.</p><p>Primary hypertension is more likely in children who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have completed puberty</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a family history of hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are overweight or obese</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary hypertension has a known cause. The most common causes of secondary hypertension include kidney disease, endocrine disorders, heart disease, and some medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">&quot;White coat&quot; hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;White coat&quot; hypertension is the name given to high blood pressure caused by anxiety when blood pressure is measured in clinic or office. Measuring the blood pressure by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, or several times during the office visit (to minimize anxiety), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> measuring the blood pressure at home outside the clinician's office can help to determine if a person has white coat hypertension or is truly hypertensive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of high blood pressure in children is discussed in detail in a separate topic review.
