The most effective way of stratifying operative risk is by using one of the available validated risk stratification models. The risk models are helpful in the evaluation and counseling of individual patients and planning perioperative care. Models have been developed to estimate risk of in-hospital mortality and complications associated with valve surgery with or without coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).</p><p>Risk stratification models for valvular surgery will be reviewed here. Other considerations in preoperative assessment of potential cardiac surgery candidates are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for valve replacement in aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and investigational approaches to management of mitral stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-procedures-for-severe-chronic-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical procedures for severe chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk stratification models are subject to limitations that may reduce their prognostic value. The models estimate risk for only specified procedures (eg, the 2008 Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS] risk model does not include estimates for concomitant aortic and mitral valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]). These include dependence upon incomplete or uncertain clinical variables; the models may not be generalizable to patient populations different from the ones in which they were formulated; and they require revision over time as surgical and perioperative care evolves and as the recognition and impact of clinical variables change.</p><p>In addition, current risk stratification models do not include several variables that may be clinically important. For example, a severely calcified ascending aorta (also known as porcelain aorta) and severe mitral annular calcification (in patients undergoing mitral surgery) are each associated with high operative morbidity and mortality but are not included in standard risk models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of mitral annular calcification&quot;</a>.) Other clinically important variables that are not included in risk models are difficult to measure, such as frailty and nutritional status.</p><p>In addition, risk models for cardiac surgery do not necessarily indicate the risk of newer transcatheter procedures, such as transcatheter aortic valve implantation, that increasingly are effective alternates to conventional surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Current guidelines recommend evaluation of patients by a specialized heart valve clinic when valve intervention is needed so that risks and benefits of a surgical versus transcatheter procedure can be discussed by a multidisciplinary team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK STRATIFICATION MODELS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk stratification models for hospital mortality following cardiac surgery include the following calculators (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83133\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83133 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 2008 Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk models for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), valve surgery, or both were developed and validated based on data on 774,881 patients operated on during 2002 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].

This model has been replaced by the 2011 EuroSCORE II model, which was developed based on data from 22,381 patients in 43 countries operated on during May to July 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Overall mortality was 3.9 percent, which is lower than would have been predicted by old risk models (additive predicted 5.8 percent and logistic predicted 7.6 percent).

Comparison of treatment options such as aortic valve surgery versus transcatheter aortic valve implantation requires accurate estimation of expected outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=percutaneous-balloon-aortic-valvotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prognostic value of the risk models depends upon the population to which the models are applied. Several studies had found that the first version of the EuroSCORE overestimated mortality for various cardiac surgery populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>], including patients undergoing mitral valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and patients undergoing high-risk aortic valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. </p><p>In patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, the STS model may provide more accurate perioperative risk estimation than the first version of the EuroSCORE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>] or the Ambler risk score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In various studies, the first version of the EuroSCORE often overestimated perioperative risk, while the STS model has been observed to under- or overestimate early postoperative mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>]. The original EuroSCORE and STS score also correlate with long-term postoperative mortality risk, though the relative strengths of these associations vary among series, and other clinical factors (such as presence of renal failure) may have greater predictive value in some groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>]. EuroSCORE II performed similarly to the STS score in a study of patients undergoing mitral valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and had discriminatory power similar to STS score in a study of patients undergoing isolated aortic valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Since the 2008 STS and EuroSCORE II risk models provide risk stratification based upon large contemporary databases with adjustment for multiple clinical variables, we recommend their use to estimate operative risk in patients in settings similar to those represented by their respective databases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21325754\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Models have been developed to estimate the risk of in-hospital mortality and complications associated with valve surgery with or without coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).
