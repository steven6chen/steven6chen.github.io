The risk of dying or of developing complications is related to the age and underlying condition of the patient, the causative pathogen, the severity and duration of illness at the time of presentation, and, occasionally, to delays in the initiation of antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in children will be discussed here.

Systemic complications, such as septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and septic or reactive arthritis are usually the consequence of the bacteremia that frequently accompanies meningitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>The neurologic complications of meningitis may be sudden or gradual in onset and can appear at any time after the onset of symptoms, including after the completion of therapy. Although many neurologic complications are severe and readily apparent, others, such as hearing loss, may be subtle or inapparent during the early phases of infection.

Impaired mental status is seen in most patients at presentation, and seizures are more often seen during the acute episode.

The incidence of complications in these studies has varied widely depending upon the time of the study and the duration of follow-up. In a meta-analysis of 45 prospective studies (1955 to 1993) including 4920 children, neurologic sequelae that persisted or developed after hospital discharge occurred in 16 percent of survivors in developed countries and 26 percent in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among the 19 reports of prospective studies from developed countries, the most common sequelae were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deafness &ndash; 11 percent, including bilateral severe or profound deafness in 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intellectual disability (mental retardation) &ndash; 4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spasticity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paresis &ndash; 4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure disorder &ndash; 4 percent</p><p/><p>In a literature review of published reports (1970 to 2010), approximately one-half of 1433 survivors of pediatric meningitis (1 month to &lt;18 years) had at least one sequela at &ge;five years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among children with sequelae, the distribution of bacterial etiologies (when specified) was as follows: <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> (37 percent), tuberculosis (12 percent), <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (4 percent), and <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> (3 percent). Among the 1012 reported sequelae, <span class=\"nowrap\">intellectual/behavioral</span> deficits (eg, cognitive impairment, academic limitations, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) accounted for 78 percent, neurologic deficits (seizures, motor deficits, cerebral palsy) for 14 percent; hearing loss for 7 percent; and vision deficits for 3 percent. </p><p>Among children with pneumococcal meningitis, there appears to be an increased incidence of certain complications (particularly empyema and hemiparesis) in the post-PCV13 vaccination era. In one study, empyema occurred in 1 percent (1 of 67) of children with pneumococcal meningitis in the three years prior to PCV13 compared with 16 percent (9 of 58) of children during the three years after PCV13 introduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similarly, hemiparesis was noted in 1 percent (1 of 76) of children in the pre-PCV13 period compared with 12 percent (8 of 69) of children the post-PCV13 period.

The major cause of severely diminished consciousness and coma is increased intracranial pressure.

The pathogenesis of seizures in meningitis is not well understood. Although fever may be a cofactor in very young children, cerebrovascular inflammation or secondary neurochemical changes are presumably the cause of most seizures. In one study, as an example, the occurrence of seizures correlated with bacterial counts of greater than 10(7) <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> in the CSF sample prior to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The two most common types of seizures in children with bacterial meningitis are partial, generalized seizures with focal predominance, and partial seizures with secondary generalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Seizures occurring before or at the time of presentation are usually generalized, whereas seizures occurring &ge;72 hours after admission are usually focal.</p><p>Seizures that occur early in the course of bacterial meningitis and that are easily controlled are rarely associated with permanent neurologic sequelae. In contrast, seizures that are prolonged, difficult to control, or begin more than 72 hours after hospitalization are more likely to be associated with neurologic sequelae, suggesting that a cerebrovascular complication may have occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/11,17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17,24</a>].

These include hearing loss, cranial nerve palsy, paresis (monoparesis, hemiparesis, quadriparesis), visual field defects, aphasia, and ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/5,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24</a>]. Most focal deficits resolve with successful treatment of the meningitis, but long-term disability can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/2,3,5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,17</a>].</p><p>The rate at which focal neurologic deficits occur in meningitis depends upon the duration of illness before treatment, the age of the patient, and the causative organism. In one review, for example, 34 percent of children with pneumococcal meningitis had one or more focal neurologic deficits compared with 15 percent in children with <em>H. influenzae</em> meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hearing loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hearing loss after bacterial meningitis may be transient or permanent.

However, sensorineural hearing loss (transient or permanent) can result from damage to the eighth cranial nerve, cochlea, or labyrinth, induced by direct bacterial invasion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the inflammatory response elicited by the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>].</p><p>Permanent sensorineural hearing loss occurs in 5 to 10 percent of children with bacterial meningitis overall and up to 30 percent of those with pneumococcal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

Ataxia is commonly associated with hearing loss in children, since both are related to bacterial labyrinthitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/9,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cranial nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cranial nerve palsies can result from compression due to brain swelling or perineuritis due to the adjacent meningeal inflammatory reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-children-neurologic-complications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The abducens (VI) nerve is the cranial nerve most commonly affected in meningitis, probably because its long intracranial segment adjacent to the brainstem is highly vulnerable to elevated intracranial pressure and the inflammatory reaction that can occur with meningitis.
