When this happens, the heart has to work harder. This causes people to have trouble breathing and to feel very tired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26908332\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing when moving around</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p/><p>Over time, you might get other symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the legs and feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not feeling hungry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p/><p>Rare symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spitting up blood</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26908347\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The tests depend on your symptoms and any other health problems you might have. You might get one or both of the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiogram &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create pictures of your heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary artery catheterization &ndash; This test measures the pressure in the blood vessels that go to your lungs. Your doctor will advance a thin, flexible tube (called a &quot;catheter&quot;) into a blood vessel in your groin, neck, or shoulder area. The catheter goes to the blood vessels in your heart.</p><p/><p>You might also need other tests to find what might be causing your pulmonary hypertension. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ECG &ndash; This test measures your heart's electrical activity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to check how well you lungs are working</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sleep study &ndash; This test checks your breathing, oxygen level, and other body functions while you are sleeping overnight. These tests can sometimes be done at home, but they are often done in a sleep lab.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26908364\"><span class=\"h1\">How is pulmonary hypertension treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include a number of different medicines. Some medicines treat the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. Others treat the pulmonary hypertension itself.</p><p>Treatments for the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">furosemide</a> (brand name: Lasix) &ndash; These medicines help control swelling in the legs and feet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Warfarin</a> (brand names: Coumadin, Jantoven) &ndash; This helps prevent blood clots in the lungs. In children, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> might be used instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen &ndash; Your doctor might have you use oxygen, which comes in a metal or plastic cylinder that you can take around with you. The oxygen flows through a tube into 2 plastic tubes that you put in your nostrils.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise &ndash; Some people with pulmonary hypertension are too tired to be very active. But if you can do some activity, walking or other light exercises can be helpful. Check with your doctor before you begin exercising.</p><p/><p>There are also medicines that treat the pulmonary hypertension itself. These might come as pills, or they might need to be given through an &quot;IV&quot; (a thin tube that goes into a vein).</p><p>People with very serious symptoms might need surgery. One option is a special type of heart surgery to make a hole in the heart to ease its workload. The other is a lung transplant or a heart-lung transplant. A transplant is a type of surgery in which a doctor replaces a diseased organ with a healthy one.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26908379\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary hypertension is a serious illness. Some cases can't be treated. Even for cases that can be treated, there is no permanent cure. For adults, the disease gets worse over time and is likely to make it hard for you to do everyday things, like bathing and dressing. For children, the disease might improve with time or it might get worse over time. Talk to your doctor to find out what to expect with your type of pulmonary hypertension.</p><p>Medicines and oxygen might make you feel better and live longer. You will need to see your doctor often to check if you need to change the dose of the medicines you take.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26908394\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart transplant (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
