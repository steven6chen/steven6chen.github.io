However, the necessary sample of arterial blood can be difficult to obtain due to diminished pulses or patient movement. Diminished pulses may reflect poor peripheral circulation or low blood pressure, while patient movement is frequently caused by the pain associated with arterial puncture. </p><p>A venous blood gas (VBG) is an alternative method of estimating systemic carbon dioxide and pH that does not require arterial blood sampling. Performing a VBG rather than an ABG is particularly convenient in the intensive care unit, since many patients have a central venous catheter from which venous blood can be quickly and easily obtained.</p><p>The sites from which venous blood can be sampled, measurements that can be performed on venous blood, and correlation of venous measurements with arterial measurements are reviewed here. Other alternatives to ABGs for estimating systemic carbon dioxide and pH are also described, including end-tidal carbon dioxide and transcutaneous carbon dioxide. ABGs, capnography, and mechanisms of oxygenation are reviewed separately.

Mixed venous blood gases are a reasonable alternative for patients whose venous access is a pulmonary artery catheter; however, a pulmonary artery catheter should not be inserted for the sole purpose of venous blood sampling.

This observation has two practical consequences. First, clinicians should be wary of VBG results and preferentially base clinical decisions on ABGs in hypotensive patients. Second, periodic correlation of the venous measurements with arterial measurements should be performed whenever venous measurements are used for serial monitoring. </p><p>These approaches are supported by the following evidence. In a study of 168 matched sample pairs from 110 patients treated in an intensive care unit, there were only small differences between the arterial and central venous blood samples (pH = 0.03 units, bicarbonate = 0.52 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> and lactate = 0.08 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-blood-gases-and-other-alternatives-to-arterial-blood-gases/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In the presence of shock, however, the difference between mixed venous and arterial blood PCO<sub>2</sub> increased by a factor of three. Numerous other studies that have similarly found poor correlation of arterial and venous blood gas measurements among patients with shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-blood-gases-and-other-alternatives-to-arterial-blood-gases/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942899\"><span class=\"h1\">END-TIDAL CARBON DIOXIDE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of end tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO<sub>2</sub>) is another method of noninvasively estimating the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>). This technique, called capnography, requires a closed system of gas collection, either with a tight fitting mask or a ventilator circuit. A sample of expired gas is analyzed by infrared or mass spectrometry, and then displayed as a numerical value or a graph. The PetCO<sub>2</sub> is usually within 1 mm of the PaCO<sub>2</sub> in healthy adults, but it is far less accurate in critically ill adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-blood-gases-and-other-alternatives-to-arterial-blood-gases/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] because of the dependence of CO<sub>2</sub> production on cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-blood-gases-and-other-alternatives-to-arterial-blood-gases/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, routine use of PetCO<sub>2</sub> exists primarily in newborn ICUs, operating rooms, and emergency departments, to provide early warning of endotracheal tube complications. PetCO<sub>2</sub> is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-dioxide-monitoring-capnography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon dioxide monitoring (capnography)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1941723\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSCUTANEOUS CARBON DIOXIDE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systems that measure both transcutaneous carbon dioxide (ptcCO<sub>2</sub>) and pulse oximetry are an attractive option because they overcome the major limitations of both ABGs (invasive arterial sampling) and VBGs (lack of information about oxygenation). Such combination systems generally have a heating element that raises the skin temperature to 42 to 45&ordm;C to increase local perfusion, an electrode to measure ptcCO<sub>2</sub>, and a light emitter and sensor to measure arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-blood-gases-and-other-alternatives-to-arterial-blood-gases/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Older studies suggested that ptcCO<sub>2</sub> measurements are accurate in neonates, but not critically ill adults because of poor peripheral perfusion (peripheral artery disease, hypotension, vasopressors). These devices were limited because their accuracy diminished when the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) was greater than 56 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-blood-gases-and-other-alternatives-to-arterial-blood-gases/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. Devices have since improved and more recent observational studies suggest that the newer systems may be more accurate in critically ill patients, including those with acute respiratory failure who have a PaCO<sub>2</sub> as high as 89 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-blood-gases-and-other-alternatives-to-arterial-blood-gases/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and in critically ill patients on vasopressors and vasodilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-blood-gases-and-other-alternatives-to-arterial-blood-gases/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Such combination systems have limitations. They may be difficult to keep calibrated, may be difficult to mount in a way that prevents air trapping, and may take up to an hour to sufficiently warm the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/venous-blood-gases-and-other-alternatives-to-arterial-blood-gases/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In addition, the devices must be attached to an ear, which may be difficult in agitated patients or in those who had neurosurgery. Given the limitations of noninvasive monitoring, any persistent or unexpected change in the ptcCO<sub>2</sub> or oxyhemoglobin saturation should be confirmed with an ABG. The use of combined pulse oximetry and ptcCO<sub>2</sub> monitoring is becoming more accurate but remains limited to specific situations and equipment and should not be used routinely outside of well-defined clinical circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942934\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An arterial blood gas (ABG) is the traditional method of estimating the systemic carbon dioxide tension and pH, usually for the purpose of assessing ventilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acid-base status.
