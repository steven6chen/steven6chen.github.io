It is a triangle-shaped area of tissue that grows from the corner of the eye towards the center. The tissue can be thin and white or thicker and pink or red. Some people get a pterygium in both eyes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80269129\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a pterygium?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A white or pink growth that partly covers the eye</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye redness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye discomfort</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry vision</p><p/><p>A few people only notice a pterygium when it starts to cover the iris. The iris is the colored part of the eye.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80269144\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you have blurry vision or other vision problems, or if you notice a growth on your eye.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80269159\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a pterygium?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have a pterygium by doing an exam and talking with you. The doctor will also check that the growth is a pterygium and not a different eye condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80269174\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a pterygium treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Artificial tears</a>&quot; &ndash; These can help with redness and irritation. You can buy artificial tears at the drug store or grocery store without a prescription. They come in liquid eye drops, gels, or ointments. Your doctor or nurse can help you decide which form is best for you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescription eye drops, gels, or ointments &ndash; Your doctor or nurse might give you these if over-the-counter <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">artificial tears</a> do not help.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Doctors might remove the pterygium if:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It causes serious vision problems, or will soon.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It keeps the eye from moving normally.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It causes serious irritation that does not go away with other treatments.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It makes the eye look very strange and this affects your life a lot.</p><p/><p>It is common for a pterygium to come back after surgery. If it does, it can be harder to get rid of the next time. So doctors usually do surgery only if a pterygium causes serious problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80269189\"><span class=\"h1\">Can a pterygium be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Protecting your eyes from the sun could help, especially if you spend a lot of time outdoors. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a hat when you are outdoors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear sunglasses that fit well and block UVA and UVB rays. The label on the sunglasses will say what type of rays they block. If you wear prescription sunglasses, make sure they block both types of UV rays.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80269204\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blepharitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blepharitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis-pink-eye-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Conjunctivitis (pink eye) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=photokeratitis-arc-eye-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Photokeratitis (arc eye) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis-pink-eye-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Conjunctivitis (pink eye) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
