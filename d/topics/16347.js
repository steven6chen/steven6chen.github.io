Other terms used to describe this tumor include neuroendocrine or primary small cell carcinoma of the skin, trabecular cell carcinoma, and anaplastic cancer of the skin.</p><p>The staging and treatment of MCC are discussed here. The clinical features and initial diagnosis of MCC are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-merkel-cell-neuroendocrine-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of Merkel cell (neuroendocrine) carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7035421\"><span class=\"h1\">TNM STAGING SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eighth (2017) edition of the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system provides important information for both management and prognosis of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). The TNM system is recommended by both the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and is presented in detail in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110971\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110971 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110972 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast to the seventh TNM staging system, the eighth edition has separate criteria for clinical and pathological staging.</p><p>Based upon the TNM information, patients are assigned to prognostic stage groups. These can be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I &ndash; Primary tumors &le;2 cm maximum tumor dimension, without evidence of regional lymph node involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II &ndash; Primary tumors &gt;2 cm (T2 or T3) or a primary tumor with invasion into bone, muscle, fascia, or cartilage (T4), without evidence of lymph node involvement. Stage II is divided into two subgroups based upon the size and depth of invasion of the primary tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III &ndash; Any primary tumor with regional lymph node disease. Pathologic stage III is divided into subgroups based upon the extent of regional lymph node involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IV &ndash; Metastasis beyond the regional lymph nodes, regardless of the status of the primary tumor and regional nodes.</p><p/><p>The eighth TNM classification is based upon an analysis of 9387 patients with MCC from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) who were diagnosed between 1998 and 2012, which provides more detailed correlation with clinical outcomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110804%7EONC%2F111601%7EONC%2F111602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110804 graphicRef111601 graphicRef111602 \">figure 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local disease &ndash; Sixty-five percent of patients had local disease without clinical or pathologic evidence of regional lymph node involvement or metastatic disease. The five-year overall survival rate for these patients was 55.6 percent, and there was a progressive decrease in overall survival for those with a T1 (&lt;2 cm), T2-3 (&gt;2 to 5, &gt;5 cm), and T4 (invasion of fascia or deeper tissues) primary lesion, with five-year overall survival rates of 55.8, 41.1, and 31.8 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional disease &ndash; At presentation, 26 percent of patients had regional lymph node involvement without disseminated metastatic disease; the five-year overall survival for this group was 35.4 percent. This group included those with occult disease (detected at sentinel lymph node biopsy or regional lymph node dissection) and those with clinically detected regional lymph node involvement or in transit metastases. The five-year overall survival for those with occult disease was 39.7 percent; for those with clinically detected nodal disease, the five-year overall survival was 26.8 percent, while for those with in transit disease, the five-year overall survival rate was 41.4 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with lymph node metastases and an unknown primary tumor constituted 3.6 percent of the total cohort.

Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG), combined with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be particularly useful and influence subsequent management in patients with stage II or III disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H883372418\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the initial evaluation, subsequent management depends upon the pathologic characteristics of the primary tumor and whether or not there is clinical evidence of lymph node or distant metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107699\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107699 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with biopsy-confirmed MCC but without clinical evidence of regional lymph node involvement, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is generally indicated prior to or in conjunction with definitive local therapy. However, the role of SLN biopsy is less clear for lesions arising in the head and neck region since the lymphatic drainage from primary tumors in this region is variable. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinically negative nodes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Head and neck lesions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a negative SLN biopsy, wide local excision is indicated. For patients in whom surgery is not technically feasible and for those who are not surgical candidates, radiation therapy (RT) to the primary tumor is an alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Primary tumor'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a positive SLN biopsy, careful evaluation for occult metastatic disease is indicated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If no metastatic disease is detected, definitive treatment of the regional lymph node basin is indicated (lymph node dissection or, if not feasible, nodal RT). Participation in a clinical trial of adjuvant immunotherapy, if available, should be considered following treatment of the lymph nodes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If distant metastatic disease is identified, systemic therapy, preferably in a protocol setting, and best supportive care are indicated. Local treatment by surgery or RT of a symptomatic primary or regional node(s) should be given if the metastatic disease is nonresponsive to chemotherapy. In situations such as a spinal cord compression or superior vena cava obstruction, RT should be started promptly. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Metastatic disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinically positive nodes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients not undergoing SLN mapping and biopsy, adjuvant RT to the regional lymph nodes is indicated.

These patients may also be considered for adjuvant immunotherapy in the context of a clinical trial, if available. Risk factors include the presence of any of the following: a primary tumor &gt;1 cm in maximum dimension, head and neck primary, positive or limited surgical resection margins, lymphovascular invasion, multiple nodes, extracapsular extension in an involved lymph node, or an immunocompromised host. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H100000130\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant immunotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected clinical lymph node involvement, biopsy confirmation (fine needle aspirate, core needle biopsy, or open biopsy) is indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If biopsy confirms the presence of nodal disease, wide local excision of the primary tumor and definitive therapy of the draining lymphatics (regional lymph node dissection or, if not feasible, nodal RT) is indicated, assuming that there are no distant metastases following an appropriate evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinically positive nodes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the biopsy is negative, SLN biopsy is indicated, as in patients not suspected of having clinical lymph node involvement. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinically negative nodes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have undergone a wide local excision and regional lymph node dissection, risk factors indicating the need for adjuvant RT to the tumor bed include the presence of a primary tumor &gt;1 cm, positive or limited surgical resection margins, lymphovascular invasion, head and neck primary, and an immunocompromised host. In addition, extracapsular extension of tumor outside the lymph node(s) or involvement of multiple nodes is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and is an indication for adjuvant regional RT following regional lymph node dissection. Participation in a clinical trial of adjuvant immunotherapy, if available, should be considered for patients considered to be at high risk following treatment of the lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"#H100000130\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant immunotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are thought to have disseminated disease after their initial evaluation, biopsy confirmation of the metastasis is required prior to systemic therapy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If disseminated metastases are confirmed, a consideration of patient specific factors, including sites of disease involvement, age, comorbidity, and patient preferences, is necessary in choosing an optimal approach. Systemic therapy should be given in the context of a formal clinical trial whenever possible.

A margin of at least 1 to 2 cm of normal-appearing skin is recommended. If margins are close or involved with tumor, postoperative RT is indicated to increase the probability of achieving local disease control. </p><p>Achieving negative margins with the initial wide local excision is important for long-term disease control. In a review of 661 cases, complete excision was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival and a trend toward better disease-free survival (p = 0.08) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Observational series suggest that adjuvant treatment improves overall and disease-free survival for patients at risk of recurrence, but this should not replace an adequate surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Because MCC often has extensive vertical growth and sometimes extends into muscle, deep margins are a potential site of failure. Mohs micrographic surgery has been advocated to improve local tumor control compared with standard wide excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. With this approach, 100 percent of all major borders, including the deep margins, are evaluated histologically. However, adjuvant RT still has a role in preventing locoregional recurrence even when Mohs surgery is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/11,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272206309\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom surgical resection is not technically feasible or who are medically unfit for surgery, definitive RT provides an alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4,6,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,16,17</a>]. Higher doses of radiation (60 to 66 Gy) are recommended if RT is used alone rather than as an adjuvant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. RT achieves an in-field disease control rate of only 75 to 85 percent, and systemic relapse is not rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>]. </p><p>Adding chemotherapy to RT has the theoretical advantage of radiosensitization and, thus, might be more effective to enhance locoregional control. However, the only data supporting this approach come from patients with MCC in the head and neck region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">REGIONAL LYMPH NODES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathologic staging of the lymph node status is important both for prognosis and treatment planning. The optimal management of the regional lymphatics depends upon whether there is clinical or pathologic evidence of involvement with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), as well the size and pathologic characteristics of the primary tumor. The approach to the management of regional lymph nodes is based upon retrospective series since there are no randomized trials that provide definitive guidance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinically negative nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with a biopsy-proven MCC should have sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and biopsy, including immunohistochemistry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. However, some clinicians do not perform SLN mapping and biopsy when the primary tumor size is &ge;2 cm since radiation therapy (RT) is indicated because of the high risk of lymph node metastases. </p><p>The role of SLN biopsy is less clear for patients with a lesion arising in the head and neck region since the lymphatic drainage from primary tumors in this region is variable. If SLN biopsy is not carried out, lymph nodes should be treated with prophylactic RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>SLN mapping and biopsy should be performed prior to or at the setting of wide local excision because surgery may disrupt the lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor. This technique, which is widely used in patients with melanoma, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma&quot;, section on 'Sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a>.) </p><p>The results of the SLN biopsy provide important prognostic information and help to guide further treatment. The impact on prognosis is illustrated by an analysis of 474 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database who underwent SLN biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with a negative biopsy had an improved five-year MCC-specific survival compared with those with a positive biopsy (84.5 versus 64.6 percent).</p><p>Approximately one-third of patients with clinically negative lymph nodes will have microscopic tumor involvement on pathologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, a negative SLN biopsy does not preclude a subsequent regional recurrence. In an analysis of 721 patients, the false-negative rate for SLN biopsy (as defined by a subsequent regional recurrence) was 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, adjuvant treatment to regional lymph nodes may be indicated even after a negative SLN biopsy, depending upon the characteristics of the primary tumor. (See <a href=\"#H287631487\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a negative SLN biopsy, adjuvant regional lymph node RT is indicated if there is a high risk of recurrence due to anatomic, technical, or histological factors (previous wide local excision or immunohistochemistry not performed). If none of these factors are present and the patient is compliant with follow-up and imaging, observation is appropriate after SLN biopsy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the SLN contains tumor, a regional lymph node dissection or definitive RT to the lymph node basin is indicated. For patients managed with a regional lymph node dissection, postoperative RT may be indicated, particularly in those with more extensive lymph node disease or extracapsular extension. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinically positive nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with suspected lymph node involvement based upon clinical or radiographic findings require histologic confirmation of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This may require fine needle aspirate, core needle biopsy, or open biopsy. </p><p>If regional nodes are involved, regional lymph node dissection is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If nodal dissection is not feasible, RT should be given. The role of adjuvant RT following lymph node dissection has not been definitively established. Extracapsular extension of tumor outside a lymph node or multiple nodes is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and is an indication for adjuvant regional RT following regional lymph node dissection. Risks of node dissection plus RT include lymphoedema, fibrosis of joints, and subsequent functional impairment. Therefore, despite retrospective studies of decreased recurrence with adjuvant RT, clinical judgment is required to decide which patients can be followed after nodal dissection without adjuvant RT. In general, patients with clinically positive nodes have a five-year disease-specific survival of approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>For patients with advanced locoregional disease, a combination of systemic therapy and RT may be more effective compared with systemic therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In one series of 27 patients with advanced locoregional MCC, chemotherapy produced responses in 18 (69 percent), which were mostly complete (41 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, in the absence of subsequent RT, the responses were short-lived. Thus, in patients with recurrent or locally advanced MCC and adequate performance status, combined systemic therapy and RT is probably the treatment of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Immunotherapy is emerging as a promising systemic treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1486586095\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287631487\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUVANT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy (RT) has an important role in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) primarily managed with surgery to treat occult lymph node disease or minimum residual tumor at the primary site. The role of chemotherapy or alternative approaches, such as immunotherapy, as part of a combined modality approach are not well established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MCC is a radiosensitive malignancy. RT has been used as an adjuvant treatment after surgery to prevent recurrence in the primary tumor bed and in regional lymphatics. Although there are no randomized trials supporting the role of adjuvant RT, multiple studies provide evidence that RT can decrease the rate of locoregional recurrence and improve overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/20,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29-31</a>].</p><p>The most extensive evidence supporting a role for adjuvant RT comes from an analysis of 6908 patients with MCC in the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In the 4843 patients without evidence of lymph node involvement (stage I or II), adjuvant RT was associated with a significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.80). In contrast, there was no improvement observed in the 2065 patients with lymph node positive (stage III) MCC (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86-1.12).</p><p>When RT is used either as an adjuvant or as definitive treatment, it is important to treat all regional lymphatics to avoid geographic miss since recurrence in untreated regions may occur. Some use a 5 cm margin to cover the surgical bed for definitive or adjuvant RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/19,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,32</a>]. As an example, the Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) 96:07 study used a 3 to 5 cm margin, and draining lymph nodes were treated in the same field as the primary if the nodal region was within 20 cm of the primary to reduce the risk of in transit recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>The dose of RT to treat either the primary tumor or regional lymph nodes is based upon the tumor burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Following a resection with negative margins, a total radiation dose of 50 to 56 Gy in patients is generally considered adequate for those at significant risk for residual subclinical disease.

In addition, the lower leg is poorly tolerant of high-dose irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p>Following initial therapy, recurrences can be local, regional, or distant. In a literature review, recurrences were local in 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/8,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,47</a>]. In contrast, nodal or distant disease was a component of the recurrence in 33 and 33 percent of cases, respectively. Patients with an initial nodal recurrence had a significantly higher chance of developing subsequent distant metastases than those without a nodal recurrence.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local recurrences usually occur within one year of initial therapy with a median time to recurrence of four months (range one to nine months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/8,25,47,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25,47,67</a>]. The risk of a local recurrence was 43 percent in a series of 251 treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in which only 17 percent of patients had adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The impact of a local recurrence on survival is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median time to develop clinically detectable nodal recurrence after resection of the primary lesion is seven to eight months. Among patients with nodal involvement, either at presentation or at recurrence, 11 to 66 percent die of their disease within five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/28,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,70,71</a>]. As with local recurrences, multimodality approaches have been associated with an improved outcome following a nodal recurrence.</p><p/><p>In the literature review of 661 patients, the median overall survival was 27 months (range 1 to 216 months) among those with recurrence and who received salvage treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/8,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,47</a>]. Combined modality therapy (surgery, RT, chemotherapy) is associated with the best salvage potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-treatment-of-merkel-cell-carcinoma/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2777971735\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation and management of locoregional disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive cutaneous malignancy that has a high propensity for regional spread via the lymphatics and for distant metastasis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a patient with a biopsy-confirmed cutaneous MCC, the initial evaluation should focus on determining whether there is clinical evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastasis. Imaging procedures should include studies of the chest (to rule out a primary small cell carcinoma of the lung) as well as any other areas suggested by clinical symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H823702040\" class=\"local\">'Initial staging procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without evidence of regional lymph node or distant metastases, sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and biopsy is generally indicated to rule out occult disease, although this is less reliable for patients with a primary tumor in the head and neck region. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinically negative nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without regional lymphatic or distant metastases, we recommend wide local excision of the primary lesion as a component of the initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Definitive radiation therapy (RT) is an alternative for patients who are not surgical candidates or for whom wider excision is not feasible. (See <a href=\"#H272206302\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients considered to be at high risk for local or regional recurrence, we recommend adjuvant local and regional RT, respectively, rather than observation following surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). High-risk factors include a primary tumor &gt;1 cm in maximum dimension, positive or limited surgical resection margins, lymphovascular invasion, or an immunocompromised host. Adjuvant nodal RT is indicated if there is a high risk of anatomic, technical, or histological failure (previous wide local excision, immunohistochemistry of SLN not performed).

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinically positive nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If regional lymph node disease is pathologically confirmed and there is no evidence of distant metastasis, definitive therapy (surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT) to both the primary lesion and regional lymphatics is indicated.

(See <a href=\"#H100000130\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant immunotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following initial definitive therapy, patients with MCC should have frequent follow-up with a focus on skin and regional lymph nodes because of the high incidence of recurrent disease and the potential for salvage with definitive therapy if distant metastases are not present. (See <a href=\"#H1905028582\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance after initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H935324811\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent and metastatic disease</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an isolated locoregional recurrence should be carefully reevaluated to exclude the presence of disseminated disease. If no distant metastases are identified, patients should be treated with an individualized multimodality salvage treatment. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with metastatic disease, we suggest treatment with the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-blocking agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=avelumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">avelumab</a> rather than chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Whenever possible, patients with advanced MCC should be referred for participation in programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor-based immunotherapy trials. (See <a href=\"#H1486586095\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If treatment with a <span class=\"nowrap\">PD-1/PD-L1</span> inhibitor-based immunotherapy is not possible, systemic chemotherapy may provide palliative benefit, although its impact on overall survival is uncertain.
