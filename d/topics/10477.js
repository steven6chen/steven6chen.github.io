Untreated OSA has many potential consequences and adverse clinical associations, including excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired daytime function, metabolic dysfunction, and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications and adverse outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>The management of obstructive sleep apnea is reviewed here. The prevalence, risk factors, natural history, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of OSA are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19916919\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of OSA therapy are to resolve signs and symptoms of OSA, improve sleep quality, and normalize the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxyhemoglobin saturation levels. OSA should be approached as a chronic disease that requires long-term, multidisciplinary management. The potential benefits of successfully treating OSA include clinical improvement (eg, less daytime sleepiness), reduced health care utilization and costs, and, possibly, decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications and adverse outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>Several national organizations have published clinical practice guidelines for the management of OSA in adults, including the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the American College of Physicians (ACP), and the International Geriatric Sleep Medicine Force [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. The recommendations discussed below are generally consistent with these guidelines.</p><p>Common to all guidelines is the recommendation that, in addition to reviewing the behavioral modifications reviewed in the next section, all patients diagnosed with OSA should be offered positive airway pressure as initial therapy. Issues relating to the precise definition of OSA, discrepancies between the consensus definition of OSA and the criteria used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reimburse positive airway pressure therapy, and potential exceptions to this approach are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H19916715\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with mild to moderate OSA who prefer not to use positive airway pressure or who fail to respond to it, oral appliances are an alternative therapy that have been shown to improve signs and symptoms of OSA and may be better tolerated in some patients than positive airway pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Upper airway surgery may supersede oral appliances as alternative therapy in patients with severe, surgically correctable, obstructing lesions of the upper airway. These alternatives to positive airway pressure therapy are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H19916068\" class=\"local\">'Alternative therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>A meta-analysis of five randomized trials and three observational studies found that treatment provided by sleep and nonsleep specialists resulted in similar symptom scores, quality of life, and adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; however, many of the nonsleep specialists also has extensive training or experience in sleep which may have biased the outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3557036149\"><span class=\"h1\">EDUCATION AND BEHAVIOR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1049241\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of a patient with OSA begins by firmly establishing the diagnosis and its severity. Disease severity guides management by identifying patients who are at greatest risk for adverse outcomes and by providing a baseline from which to measure the effectiveness of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Diagnosis and disease severity are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once the diagnosis of OSA is confirmed and its severity determined, the results of all testing should be reviewed with the patient. The patient should be educated about the risk factors, natural history, and consequences of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Importantly, all patients should be warned about the increased risk of motor vehicle accidents associated with untreated OSA and the potential consequences of driving or operating other dangerous equipment while sleepy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients should also be counseled to avoid activities that require vigilance and alertness if sleepy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drowsy-driving-risks-evaluation-and-management#H877976949\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drowsy driving: Risks, evaluation, and management&quot;, section on 'Prevention and countermeasures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavior modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavior modification is indicated for all patients who have OSA and a modifiable risk factor. The types of behavior modification that should be instituted depend upon the characteristics of the patient. Overweight or obese patients should be encouraged to lose weight. Patients with positional OSA should change their sleep position accordingly. All patients should be advised that alcohol and certain common medications, such as benzodiazepines, may worsen their OSA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Weight loss and exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight loss and exercise should be recommended to all patients with OSA who are overweight or obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1,2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,9</a>]. While rarely leading to complete remission of OSA, weight loss, including that from bariatric surgery, has been shown to improve overall health and metabolic parameters, decrease the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep), reduce blood pressure, improve quality of life, and probably decrease daytime sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/10-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Initial treatment for weight loss should be aimed at decreasing food intake and, when possible increasing energy expenditure. Available strategies for weight loss include behavioral modification, dietary therapy, exercise, drug therapy, and surgery. These are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effects of weight loss on OSA were illustrated by a trial that enrolled 72 consecutive overweight patients (mean BMI 32 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m2)</span> with mild OSA (mean AHI 10 events per hour of sleep) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The patients were randomly assigned to receive a single session of general nutrition and exercise advice, or a more intensive program that included a low calorie diet for three months plus nutrition and exercise counseling for one year. Patients in the latter group had significantly greater weight loss (11 versus 2 kg), reduction in the AHI (mean change from baseline, -4 versus 0.3 events per hour), and improvement in quality of life compared with the control group. There was no difference in the degree of improvement in daytime sleepiness, but the relevance of this is uncertain since the degree of daytime sleepiness was barely abnormal at baseline. Smaller studies that included patients with more severe OSA and more daytime sleepiness at baseline suggest that weight loss also improves daytime sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The effect of weight loss achieved via bariatric surgery on OSA appears to be similar, with reductions in AHI proportional to weight loss but few complete remissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery#H353466734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical outcomes following bariatric surgery&quot;, section on 'Obstructive sleep apnea'</a>.)</p><p>Patients whose OSA improves or resolves after weight loss should strive to maintain their weight loss, since weight gain has been associated with worsening or recurrence of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. In addition, CPAP therapy itself may be associated with weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Counseling regarding ongoing diet modification and exercise, as well as referral to a nutritionist, may be beneficial. Nevertheless, longer term follow up of several randomized studies suggests that the initial improvement in AHI achieved through weight loss can persist for several years despite up to 50 percent weight regain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/15,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,28,29</a>]. Such sustained improvement may be most relevant for patients with mild to moderate OSA at baseline rather than those with severe OSA, who have a lower likelihood of achieving clinically meaningful reductions in AHI and complete remission from weight loss at both early and late time points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/15,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,30</a>].</p><p>Exercise may modestly improve OSA even in the absence of significant weight loss. In a 2014 meta-analysis that included five small randomized trials, a supervised exercise program was associated with significantly improved AHI (mean change, -6 <span class=\"nowrap\">events/hour),</span> sleep efficiency, subjective sleepiness, and cardiorespiratory fitness with minimal change in body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleep position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the diagnostic sleep study, some patients will be observed to have OSA that develops or worsens during sleep in the supine position. Such patients tend to have less severe OSA, to be less obese, and to be younger than non-positional patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Sleeping in a non-supine position (eg, lateral recumbent) may correct or improve OSA in such patients and should be encouraged but not generally relied upon as the sole therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].</p><p>Several commercial devices are available that use vibratory feedback around the chest or neck to restrict supine sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. However, sleeping in a non-supine position should not be used as the primary therapy unless normalization of the AHI when sleeping in a non-supine position has been confirmed by polysomnography and adherence can be verified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>]. In addition, there is a lack of long-term efficacy and adherence data on these devices. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Alcohol avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with untreated OSA should avoid alcohol, even during the daytime, because it can depress the central nervous system, exacerbate OSA, worsen sleepiness, and promote weight gain. Acute alcohol consumption often worsens the duration and frequency of obstructive respiratory events during sleep as well as the degree of oxyhemoglobin desaturation and snoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In patients who snore but do not have OSA at baseline, alcohol consumption can prompt frank OSA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Concomitant medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any clinician who prescribes medication for the patient should be informed that the patient has OSA, since certain medications with inhibitory effects on the central nervous system should be avoided if reasonable alternatives exist. In particular, benzodiazepines should be avoided in untreated patients.</p><p>Other medications that may exacerbate OSA and worsen daytime sleepiness include benzodiazepine receptor agonists, barbiturates, other antiepileptic drugs, sedating antidepressants, antihistamines, and opiates. Antidepressants that cause weight gain (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>) might be particularly problematic in these patients. Some antidepressants may worsen sleep by causing restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults#H1663814\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Avoidance of aggravating factors'</a>.)</p><p>When such medications are felt to be necessary despite the patient's OSA, their use should be monitored closely and the dose carefully titrated if possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-effects-of-medications-on-sleep-quality-and-sleep-architecture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The effects of medications on sleep quality and sleep architecture&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">POSITIVE AIRWAY PRESSURE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positive airway pressure therapy is the mainstay of therapy for adults with OSA. The mechanism of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) involves maintenance of a positive pharyngeal transmural pressure so that the intraluminal pressure exceeds the surrounding pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. CPAP also stabilizes the upper airway through increased end-expiratory lung volume. As a result, respiratory events due to upper airway collapse (eg, apneas, hypopneas) are prevented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2269684852\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is high quality evidence from randomized trials and meta-analyses that in most adults, including the elderly, positive airway pressure therapy reduces the frequency of respiratory events during sleep, decreases daytime sleepiness, improves systemic blood pressure, lowers the risk of crashes, and improves quality of life across a range of disease severities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/19,43-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,43-51</a>]. However, no convincing effect on mortality has been demonstrated. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 35 randomized trials, CPAP compared with sham resulted in a significant reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; mean difference -33.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">events/hour)</span> as well as improved daytime sleepiness as assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (mean difference -2 points), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and sleep-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. No appreciable effect on mortality was reported. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 22 randomized trials (1160 patients) that compared nocturnal CPAP with a control (sham CPAP, placebo tablets, or conservative management), nocturnal CPAP significantly improved both subjective and objective sleepiness, quality of life, cognitive function, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">More limited data also suggest that positive airway pressure therapy can improve symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], heart failure outcomes, and reduce the risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation and nocturnal arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-disordered-breathing-in-heart-failure#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure&quot;, section on 'Positive airway pressure therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Direct comparisons of positive airway pressure to mandibular advancement devices (MAD) have used CPAP as the mode of positive airway pressure. Trials indicate that CPAP is more effective than MADs at reducing the frequency and severity of both respiratory events and oxyhemoglobin desaturation episodes during sleep, but symptomatic improvement is similar. Some studies have indicated that patients prefer oral appliances over CPAP therapy, at least with short-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, a network meta-analyses of 80 randomized trials reported that CPAP was the most effective at reducing AHI, when compared to other OSA therapies including MADs, exercise training, and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The related MAD trials are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-appliances-in-the-treatment-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral appliances in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Compared with positive airway pressure'</a>.)</p><p>Although multiple observational studies have reported an association between CPAP use and decreased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>], no randomized trial has demonstrated a mortality benefit from positive airway pressure therapy in patients with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This may be because most randomized trials that have compared positive airway pressure with either no therapy or a sham therapy usually measured short-term outcomes, such as the frequency of respiratory events during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and quality of life, or because average CPAP usage achieved in most trials has not been sufficient to translate into measurable mortality benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The effect of CPAP on body weight is unclear. One meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials of mostly middle-aged men with moderate to severe OSA reported that three months of CPAP was associated with a small but significant increase in weight and body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Although comparisons of CPAP patients with active lifestyle changes were excluded from the analysis, the effect was small and may not be clinically meaningful, especially in those in whom weight loss interventions are prescribed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19916715\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different organizations advocate different thresholds for the initiation of positive airway pressure therapy in OSA, as the following examples demonstrate:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends offering positive airway pressure therapy to all patients who have been diagnosed with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,59</a>]. OSA is defined as either an obstructive respiratory disturbance index (RDI) &ge;15 events per hour with or without symptoms, or an obstructive RDI between 5 and 14 events per hour that is accompanied by any of the following: sleepiness, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, or insomnia symptoms; waking up with breath holding, gasping, or choking; habitual snoring <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> breathing interruptions; hypertension, mood disorder, cognitive dysfunction, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, or type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The obstructive RDI is the number of obstructive apneas, obstructive hypopneas, and respiratory effort related arousals (RERAs) per hour of sleep; it is usually higher than the AHI (the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults#H86030606\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;, section on 'Respiratory disturbance index'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the United States has its own guidelines for reimbursement of positive airway pressure therapy. Positive airway pressure therapy for OSA is reimbursed when the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is &ge;15 events per hour, or between 5 and 14 events per hour and associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired neurocognitive function, mood disorders, insomnia, cardiovascular disease (eg, hypertension, ischemic heart disease), or a history of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The AHI is the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. CMS will also reimburse for positive airway therapy if the OSA was diagnosed on the basis of an abnormal RDI. This permits therapy to be instituted on the basis of home testing. However, it is important to realize that the CMS defines the RDI as the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of recording. This is different than the usual definition of the RDI because it does not count respiratory effort related arousals (RERAs) and it is calculated per hour of recording rather than per hour of sleep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults#H86030600\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;, section on 'Apnea-hypopnea index'</a>.)</p><p/><p>While the AASM consensus guideline parameters are useful for the majority of patients, we and others suggest having a lower threshold for initiating therapy in several additional circumstances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F70443\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70443 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Our approach is to also initiate therapy in the following groups of patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an AHI &gt;5 events per hour of sleep plus one or more clinical or physiologic sequelae attributable to OSA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an AHI &ge;15 events per hour of sleep, even in the absence of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who perform mission critical work (eg, airline pilots, air traffic controllers, locomotive engineers, bus and truck drivers) and have an AHI between 5 and 15 events per hour of sleep, even if there are no clinical or physiological symptoms attributable to OSA. Individuals with an AHI in this range who are truly asymptomatic may or may not be at risk for impaired driving. However, individuals tend to under-report symptoms when their occupation may be at risk, so judging whether a patient is symptomatic or not can be difficult. The decision to initiate therapy therefore requires some clinician judgement as well as recognition that the driver may be poorly motivated to report symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an increased number of RERAs (eg, &ge;10 per hour) and excessive daytime sleepiness, even if the AHI is &le;5 events per hour.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Modes of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common modes of positive airway pressure administration include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP), and autotitrating positive airway pressure (APAP). We generally favor CPAP as initial therapy because it is the most familiar and best studied.</p><p>The available modes of positive airway pressure therapy are summarized as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CPAP delivers positive airway pressure at a level that remains constant throughout the respiratory cycle. It is used most often because it is the simplest, the most extensively studied, and associated with the most clinical experience. A pressure relief setting (ie, lowers the positive airway pressure at the onset of exhalation) is sometimes used to improve comfort and tolerance of the device.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BPAP delivers a preset inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). The degree of pressure support and consequently tidal volume is related to the difference between the IPAP and EPAP. As an example, the tidal volume is greater using an IPAP of 15 cm H2O and an EPAP of 5 cm H2O (difference of 10 cm H2O), than an IPAP of 10 cm H2O and an EPAP of 5 cm H2O (difference of 5 cm H2O). There is no proven advantage to using BPAP instead of CPAP for the routine management of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. BPAP should not be confused with BiPAP, which is the brand name of a single manufacturer and is just one of many devices that can deliver BPAP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>APAP increases or decreases the level of positive airway pressure in response to a change in airflow, a change in circuit pressure, or a vibratory snore (signs that generally indicate that upper airway resistance has changed). The degree of improvement of major outcomes conferred by APAP and CPAP is similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/63-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-67</a>]. However, the performance of APAP can be highly variable, the body of evidence supporting its efficacy is more limited than that of fixed CPAP, and direct comparisons with fixed CPAP have not identified definitive benefits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Auto-titrating CPAP'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) provides a varying amount of inspiratory pressure superimposed on a low level of CPAP. It can be helpful in patients who have concomitant central apneas, which may occur as a consequence of CPAP (treatment-emergent central apneas), patients on long-acting opioids (narcotic-induced central sleep apnea), and patients who have had a stroke or kidney disease (central sleep apnea due to other conditions). However, based upon the SERVE-HF trial, caution should be exercised when using ASV in patients with heart failure and a Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern, specifically those with a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 45 percent, since a higher cardiovascular mortality in association with ASV use was reported in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

It is estimated that 20 to 40 percent of patients do not use their positive airway pressure device and many others do not use it all night, every night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/69-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-75</a>]. In most studies, the average nightly usage of CPAP is only about four hours. Recognition of nonadherence is important because there are a variety of interventions that can help promote CPAP use, including troubleshooting device side effects and behavioral therapy. Adherence with positive airway pressure therapy is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19916262\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who elect to be treated with positive airway pressure should be evaluated frequently, especially during the first few weeks of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This may include frequent telephone calls and as-needed opportunities to meet face to face with a clinician. Adherence and efficacy can be monitored remotely with PAP devices that include modems. Communication with the devices can be bidirectional so that pressures can be adjusted remotely. The purpose of frequent evaluations is to quickly identify and manage any side effects that develop, since this may affect long-term adherence with the therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once any side effects of the positive airway pressure are successfully managed and the patient is adhering to the therapy, the patient should be asked whether the symptoms of OSA have resolved. In addition, objective data on compliance and effectiveness can be downloaded from the patient's device and reviewed, although studies on the accuracy of the information are mixed. An objective sleep evaluation is generally unnecessary if the symptoms of OSA have resolved, but repeat testing is indicated for patients who do not improve or who have recurrent or persistent symptoms such as daytime sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Objective testing may consist of polysomnography or type 3 home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) with concurrent CPAP use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home sleep apnea testing for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adherence-with-continuous-positive-airway-pressure-cpap#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adherence with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&quot;, section on 'Identification'</a>.)</p><p>The purpose of such testing is to help the clinician determine the reason for the treatment failure. Possible causes of treatment failure include nonadherence or suboptimal adherence, weight gain, an inappropriate level of prescribed positive pressure, or an additional disorder causing sleepiness (eg, narcolepsy) that may require alterations in the therapeutic regimen. A review of medications should also be undertaken since many drugs may lead to sleepiness. Inadequate sleep time may also negate the expected effects from treatment of OSA.</p><p>Once the patient's positive airway pressure therapy has been optimized and symptoms resolved, a regimen of long-term follow-up should be established. Annual visits are reasonable, with more frequent visits in between if new issues arise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The purpose of long-term follow-up is to assess usage and monitor for recurrent OSA, new side effects, air leakage, and fluctuations in body weight.</p><p>OSA has been associated with other medical conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. Any comorbid condition that may be impacted by OSA should be monitored closely following the initiation of OSA-specific therapy. Therapy directed at such comorbidities may need to be modified once therapy for OSA is instituted. As an example, dosages of antihypertensive medications may need to be reduced after successful treatment of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Oral appliances'</a> below.)</p><p>A variety of surgical approaches have also been explored in OSA; their role is primarily in patients with severe, obstructing lesions of the upper airway who have failed positive airway pressure therapy and an oral device.

This is based upon the recognition that while positive airway pressure is generally more effective than an oral appliance at normalizing respiratory events and oxyhemoglobin desaturation episodes during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/44,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,77</a>], most patients prefer an oral appliance, adherence is an essential aspect of successful treatment, both modalities are effective compared to no treatment or a sham treatment, and both modalities have a similar effect on symptoms and quality of life.

We generally consider surgical therapy when positive airway pressure or an oral appliance is declined or ineffective (after at least a three month trial of therapy). Surgical treatment appears to be most effective in patients who have OSA due to a severe, surgically correctable, obstructing lesion of the upper airway. Examples of surgically correctable lesions that may obstruct the upper airway include tonsillar hypertrophy, adenoid hypertrophy, or craniofacial abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults/abstract/1,9,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,78</a>].</p><p>Hypoglossal nerve stimulation via an implantable neurostimulator device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F93258\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93258 \">picture 1</a>) is a novel treatment strategy that may have a role in selected patients with moderate to severe OSA, although early results are mixed and further data are needed.
