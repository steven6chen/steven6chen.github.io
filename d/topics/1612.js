Although the exact incidence is difficult to ascertain, CUP accounted for 2 percent of all cancer diagnoses in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries between 1973 and 1987 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Within the category of CUP, tumors from many primary sites with varying biologic behavior are represented. Approximately 70 percent are adenocarcinomas, 15 to 20 percent are poorly differentiated carcinomas, and an additional 10 percent represent poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. The remainder are squamous cell, neuroendocrine, or poorly differentiated neoplasms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the classification and management of cancers of unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prognosis for most patients with CUP is poor. However, substantial improvements have been made in treating some subsets. The identification of specific subgroups of treatable patients has been made possible by the development of specialized immunohistologic techniques that can aid in tumor characterization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62750\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62750 \">table 1</a>) and by the recognition of several clinical syndromes that are predictive for a durable response to systemic therapy.</p><p>One such subgroup consists of women (rarely men) who have adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma in the axillary lymph nodes and who have no evident primary breast lesion or distant disease spread after completion of the routine staging evaluation. Such patients are potentially curable when managed according to standard guidelines for anatomic stage II breast cancer.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the treatment of women with adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma in axillary nodes who do not have an evident primary breast cancer. The identification and management of other subgroups of patients with CUP is discussed in detail elsewhere, as is the general approach to neoplasms of unknown primary site.

In modern series, occult breast cancer accounts for 0.1 to 0.8 percent of all newly diagnosed breast cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/3-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-10</a>], and the incidence has not decreased with improvements in breast imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, palpable axillary nodes are more often related to benign rather than malignant disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, when cancer is identified, the most common tumor causing axillary lymphadenopathy is breast cancer. In several series, the incidence of breast cancer in mixed populations of men and women with metastatic axillary adenopathy is 50 percent or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The vast majority are women; although occult primary breast cancer has been reported in men, it is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Other neoplasms that may present with axillary nodal involvement are lymphomas, melanomas, sarcomas, thyroid cancers, skin cancers, lung cancers, and less often, uterine, ovarian, sweat gland, or gastric cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In approximately 30 percent of cases, the primary site is never identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL DIAGNOSTIC WORKUP</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the diagnostic workup of a patient with unexplained axillary adenopathy is a biopsy. Besides standard light microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, other techniques such as immunohistochemistry and sometimes electron microscopy can help to narrow the differential diagnosis. The remainder of this topic review will focus on patients who are found to have an adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma in the axillary nodes.

On the other hand, differential expression of cytokeratins (CKs) can assist in this differentiation. CK20 is a low molecular weight cytokeratin that is normally expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelium, urothelium, and in Merkel cells; CK7 is expressed by tumors of the lung, ovary, endometrium, and breast, and not in the lower gastrointestinal tract. The pattern of CK20 and CK7 may be particularly helpful in suggesting a primary site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58475 \">table 2</a>). The presence of CK7 and absence of CK20 favors a diagnosis of breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>TTF-1 is rarely positive in breast cancers, while it is positive in 70 to 80 percent of nonsquamous cancers arising in the lung. CA-125 is commonly positive in ovarian carcinomas, but is positive in about 10 percent of breast cancers. As with <span class=\"nowrap\">ER/PR,</span> its presence in an axillary node, particularly in conjunction with other compatible IHC findings, lends support to a diagnosis of an occult breast primary.</p><p>Although positive staining for ER <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PR supports a possible diagnosis of breast cancer, these markers are nonspecific and they may also be expressed in ovarian, uterine, lung, stomach, thyroid, and hepatobiliary cancers. However, <span class=\"nowrap\">ER/PR</span> staining of an axillary node is compelling evidence of a primary breast cancer.</p><p>Other breast cancer-specific IHC stains are BRST2 (for GCDFP) and mammaglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. BRST2 is positive in 65 to 80 percent of cases and is relatively specific for breast cancer; rarely, it is positive in skin adnexal tumors, endometrial cancers, and salivary gland tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/18,19,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,22,23</a>]. While mammaglobin is more sensitive, it is less specific for breast cancer (gynecologic, lung, urothelial, thyroid, colon and hepatobiliary tumors may stain positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]), and both stains are thus typically used together.</p><p>HER2 immunostaining is not generally useful for the differential diagnosis of a carcinoma arising in the axillary nodes as it lacks specificity. Furthermore, only 18 to 20 percent of breast cancers overexpress this protein. However, assay for HER2 overexpression by IHC or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is a routine component of the evaluation of all breast cancers as it permits the identification of those women who are most likely to respond to treatments targeting HER2 (eg, the therapeutic monoclonal antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> [Herceptin&reg;]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=her2-and-predicting-response-to-therapy-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HER2 and predicting response to therapy in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast examination and mammography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to histologic analysis of the biopsy specimen, the diagnostic workup of a patient diagnosed with an adenocarcinoma or a poorly differentiated carcinoma in the axillary lymph nodes is initially targeted toward finding a breast primary carcinoma. A complete physical examination of both breasts is indicated as well as diagnostic mammography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>A nonpalpable, clinically occult lesion is identified mammographically in 10 to 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/4,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,25,26</a>]. However, although mammography may provide useful information, it may also be misleading. Many occult nonpalpable tumors are missed because of their relatively small size (in one series 30 percent of occult breast primaries were 5 mm or less in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]) and because they are obscured on the mammogram by dense fibroglandular tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Furthermore, an abnormal mammogram does not necessarily indicate breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/17,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,28</a>]. Suspicious findings warrant biopsy to confirm the clinical suspicion, and a negative mammogram in the appropriate clinical setting should prompt further imaging evaluation of the breast with ultrasound <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> breast MRI.

Data from several small series suggest that breast MRI can detect a primary breast cancer in approximately 75 percent of women who present with axillary <span class=\"nowrap\">adenocarcinoma/poorly</span> differentiated carcinoma and a negative clinical examination and mammogram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62800\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62800 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/29-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-38</a>]. Furthermore, the identification of a primary breast cancer by MRI may facilitate breast-conserving surgery instead of mastectomy.</p><p>A systematic literature review on the clinical utility of breast MRI in occult breast cancer included eight retrospective studies, totaling 250 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A lesion suspect for primary breast cancer was located by MRI in 72 percent of cases (pooled mean), which in 85 to 100 percent of cases represented a malignant breast tumor. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of MRI for breast cancer detection in the only two studies that reported histopathologic confirmation was 90 and 31 percent, respectively. Breast MRI revealed a lesion that was amenable to lumpectomy in about one-third of cases, although some of the patients who were eligible for lumpectomy elected to undergo mastectomy instead. </p><p>Bilateral breast MRI is now considered a standard approach to evaluation of the breasts in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

All suspicious findings on<strong> </strong>MRI require pathologic confirmation. Some lesions found on MRI can be identified on subsequent, targeted &quot;second-look&quot; ultrasound (US) and may then be biopsied under US guidance. US correlate findings have a high likelihood of malignancy. For the remaining lesions, targeting requires MRI guidance. Breast MRI should be performed with a dedicated breast coil by expert breast imaging radiologists at institutions that have the capability to perform MRI guided needle biopsy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wire localization of the findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/29,31,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31,40-43</a>].

However, if the histologic and IHC analysis is compatible, these patients are treated according to established guidelines for anatomic stage II breast cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Completion of the staging workup</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extensive workup evaluation is not necessary.

As with patients who have an identified breast primary and axillary nodal metastases, radionuclide bone scan is reserved for symptomatic women or those with an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. The utility of PET scanning is controversial.

Besides providing prognostic information that will guide further treatment, dissection aids local control. About one-half of patients with occult breast primaries will be found to have four or more positive lymph nodes, an indication for postmastectomy chest wall irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

For women who do not have a discrete lesion identified by breast imaging, the options are mastectomy, breast-conserving treatment using whole breast radiation therapy (RT), and observation alone. Patients who undergo mastectomy with ALND may have a more favorable outcome compared with patients undergoing ALND. However, the same study showed that mastectomy and ALND had similar outcomes with whole breast RT and ALND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Mastectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standard approach is to perform a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) at the time of ALND.

The primary tumor is usually less than 2 cm in diameter; in occasional patients, only carcinoma in situ is identified. The benefits of local treatment were addressed in a retrospective analysis of 51 cases of occult breast cancer in which women who had mastectomy had a markedly lower rate of local recurrence compared to those who had no local therapy (77 versus 26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

There are no randomized trials comparing this approach to mastectomy, and the only available data are from small retrospective case series. In published reports limited to patients with occult breast cancer, local control rates with primary whole-breast RT range from 73 to 100 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F65411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65411 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/5,9,46,48,50,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,46,48,50,52-54</a>].

Further analysis of the subgroup of patients who received standard adjuvant therapy revealed that seven of eight patients who did not undergo mastectomy died of their disease, compared to only 3 of 13 patients who did.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database from 1983-2006 identified 750 cases of occult breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of the 470 patients who underwent mastectomy or breast conserving therapy, the 10-year overall survival was significantly higher than it was for the 126 patients who underwent ALND only (65 versus 59 percent; p=0.02) or the 94 patients undergoing observation only with no surgery (48 percent, p=0.04 for the comparison). Mastectomy did not improve outcomes compared with breast conserving therapy.</p><p/><p>Thus, in view of the high percentage of patients who will develop a clinically manifest tumor recurrence and the possible adverse effect on survival, observation of the breast without definitive local therapy is generally <strong>not</strong> recommended at most institutions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuvant systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefit of adjuvant systemic therapy has not been systematically studied among women presenting with axillary metastases and an occult primary breast cancer.

Guidelines from the NCCN, as well as from the International Consensus Panel recommend chemotherapy for all women with node-positive breast cancer, regardless of hormone receptor status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/24,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,61</a>].

However, this is a controversial issue because of the marked heterogeneity in adjuvant treatment (a factor that clearly affects survival) in many of the older large surveys from which the prognostic estimates for node-positive clinically apparent breast cancer were derived, and the limited duration of follow-up in reports of patients treated for occult breast cancer.</p><p>In the 2017 cancer statistics report from the American Cancer Society, the five-year survival among patients diagnosed with breast cancer was 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This result compares favorably to that reported in the series of occult breast cancers specifically. However, survival for women with node-negative breast cancer declines over time, and it may be as low as 30 percent at 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Because of the small size and limited follow-up duration of the available reports of women with axillary metastases and an occult primary breast cancer, it is not possible to conclude that outcomes are similar, worse, or better than expected for women treated for clinically apparent primary tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">METASTATIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who present with adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma in the axillary nodes, no evident primary breast tumor, and who have metastatic sites in addition to axillary lymph nodes should receive a trial of systemic therapy using guidelines for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.</p><p>Patients with ER <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PR-positive tumors may derive major palliative benefit from hormone therapy.

Although the prognosis for most patients with CUP is poor, specific subgroups of treatable patients have been identified using specialized immunohistologic techniques that can aid in tumor characterization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62750\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62750 \">table 1</a>) and by the recognition of several clinical syndromes that predict for a durable response to systemic therapy.
