Thus, the recommendations for children that follow are based mainly upon extrapolation from studies involving adults, and the clinical experience of experts, as reflected in consensus guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-in-children-secondary-prevention/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Antiplatelet therapy is a mainstay of secondary ischemic stroke prevention in children and adults. Once dissection and cardioembolic causes are excluded, the American College of Chest Physician (ACCP) guidelines for antithrombotic therapy in children suggest daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> (1 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily) for a minimum of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ischemic-stroke-in-children-secondary-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In adults, there is accumulating evidence that the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel does not offer greater benefit for stroke prevention than either agent alone, but does substantially increase the risk of bleeding complications.

Nevertheless, revascularization surgery is suggested for most children and young adult patients with symptomatic moyamoya disease, particularly in light of the ineffectiveness of medical treatment. In addition, revascularization surgery is suggested for asymptomatic children with decreased regional cerebral blood flow or inadequate perfusion reserve as measured by cerebral blood flow studies. Evidence regarding the benefit of antiplatelet agents in moyamoya disease is limited and equivocal. Nevertheless, long-term therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> rather than no medical therapy is suggested for children and adults with asymptomatic or symptomatic ischemic moyamoya disease or moyamoya syndrome.
