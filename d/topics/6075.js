As a result, accurate clinical staging is critical for selecting appropriate treatment options. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has a central role in the initial staging of esophageal carcinoma and may also be useful for detecting disease recurrence.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the role of EUS in the care of patients with esophageal carcinoma. An overview of the diagnosis and staging of esophageal carcinoma is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial evaluation of the patient diagnosed with esophageal carcinoma centers on the assessment of operative risk and tumor stage. Comorbid conditions may preclude a patient with a potentially resectable tumor from undergoing surgery. Preoperative tumor staging is warranted in patients who are considered to be surgical candidates because their disease extent will influence treatment planning (eg, it may reveal that a patient is a candidate for endoscopic resection). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of resectable esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of superficial esophageal cancer&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic resection'</a>.)</p><p>Staging usually begins with a computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate for the presence of metastatic disease. However, with increasing availability, positron emission tomography (PET) CT fusion scanning may be more accurate for the detection of stage IV disease, and can be used as an initial staging assessment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A more detailed evaluation of locoregional disease extent (T and N stage) should be obtained if distant metastases are not demonstrated. A number of studies have demonstrated that EUS is more accurate than transabdominal ultrasound, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or PET scanning for locoregional staging of esophageal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/1-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-17</a>], with an overall accuracy of EUS for T and N staging of 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Overall, study results will be influenced by the number of early versus advanced T-stage patients as EUS is more accurate in the latter population. A strong correlation exists between tumor differentiation, T-stage and lymph node status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A meta-analysis of diagnostic test characteristics made the following estimates for EUS, CT, and PET scanning, concluding that the three approaches were complementary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For EUS, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting celiac lymph node metastases (considered regional lymph nodes) were 85 percent (95% CI 72-99 percent) and 96 percent (95% CI 92-100 percent), respectively.

If the EUS identifies only mucosal (T1a) disease, endoscopic mucosal resection is usually the next step to remove the tumor and precisely define the depth of invasion. The pathology result from the endoscopic mucosal resection (particularly the presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion) can then be used to guide the decision as to whether endoscopic therapy alone is sufficient or if surgery should be recommended. On the other hand, if the EUS identifies esophageal cancer that invades the muscularis mucosa, or if there is evidence of lymph node involvement, then surgical therapy is frequently recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-resectable-esophageal-and-esophagogastric-junction-cancers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of resectable esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-chemoradiotherapy-neoadjuvant-approaches-and-postoperative-adjuvant-therapy-for-localized-cancers-of-the-esophagus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy, chemoradiotherapy, neoadjuvant approaches, and postoperative adjuvant therapy for localized cancers of the esophagus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of superficial esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, some have suggested that EUS should not be used to determine which patients should go to surgery, and that instead, patients should undergo a careful endoscopic examination and endoscopic mucosal resection without EUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Studies on the accuracy of EUS for staging superficial esophageal cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-superficial-esophageal-cancer#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of superficial esophageal cancer&quot;, section on 'Accuracy of EUS in the staging evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Although T1 lesions can be identified using echoendoscopes operating at 7.5 and 12 MHz, distinguishing subgroups of the T1 stage (muscularis mucosa <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> submucosal invasion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64349 \">figure 1</a>) can be problematic with these instruments because the frequencies are too low to visualize the muscularis mucosa. High-frequency catheters permit determination of the tumor extension into the muscularis mucosa with an accuracy as high as 84 percent when histology is used as the gold standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite these advantages, high-frequency catheters have some drawbacks. Their limited depth of penetration into surrounding tissues (approximately 3 cm) precludes adequate assessment of the N stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As an example, in one report of 54 patients undergoing preoperative EUS, the accuracy of N staging in traversable tumors was significantly worse with the high-frequency linear catheter than with the conventional radial-scanning echoendoscope (90 versus 48 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Obtaining an adequate acoustic coupling with the esophageal wall can also be problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The technique most commonly used to facilitate these examinations consists of attaching a latex condom to the distal end of the endoscope and then instilling water through the biopsy channel of the scope. This provides a fluid bath through which the catheter can image the infiltration of the tumor into the different layers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A balloon sheath (Olympus UM-BS20-26R) placed over the ultrasound catheter (Olympus UM-2R and UM-3R) has been specifically developed for this use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Combined use of the balloon-sheathed catheter with a dual lumen gastroscope provides an efficient method of accurately staging patients with early esophageal carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">EUS for staging advanced tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The large caliber of dedicated radial echoendoscopes (12.7 mm in diameter) may preclude complete EUS staging in patients with stenotic esophageal tumors. This was illustrated in a series of 113 patients who underwent esophagectomy in whom the accuracy of EUS for T and N staging was much higher for traversable (81 and 86 percent, respectively) as compared with nontraversable tumors (28 and 72 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Several options are available to improve accuracy in these settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilatation of the lumen to a diameter of 14 to 16 mm with either a Savary dilator or a pneumatic balloon may permit traversal of stenotic lesions in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, a perforation frequency of up to 24 percent has been described with this practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The high perforation rate may in part be due to the blunt tips of the older instruments used in the reports cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Newer echoendoscopes appear to reduce the risk of perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Patients with severely stenotic tumors may be best served by serial, progressive dilation over several days rather than a single dilation when attempting to gain access across the tumor for purposes of staging. In one report, Savary dilation to 14 to 16 mm permitted passage of the echoendoscope in 85 to 100 percent of patients without complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]; two additional dilators of incremental diameter were passed once resistance was encountered, and the dilation was limited to &lt;13 mm in one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound catheters introduced through the biopsy channel of the endoscope can traverse tight strictures due to their small caliber (3 mm in maximum diameter). Although this may improve the accuracy of T and N staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], limited depth of penetration can lead to incomplete assessment of locoregional spread.</p><p/><p>In summary, these techniques permit complete examination of stenotic tumors in most patients. The additional information that may be obtained must be balanced by the risk of perforation when dilation is undertaken. A direct comparison of these techniques to determine their comparative accuracy has not been performed. Our practice is to perform endoscopy with a standard gastroscope initially at the time of EUS. If the gastroscope cannot traverse the stenosis, we do not dilate the lesion, as we infrequently are able to pass the echoendoscope even with this intervention. In patients with circumferential stenosis permitting passage of a gastroscope but not the echoendoscope, judicious dilation is undertaken. We are particularly cautious when semi-circumferential involvement is present, since the normal (and hence thinner) esophageal wall may be at increased risk of tearing in this setting, particularly if the proximal esophagus is dilated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3090718733\"><span class=\"h2\">Accuracy of EUS for determining unresectability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The T4 staging has been refined in 2010 and 2017 guidelines. Tumors staged as T4b are considered unresectable, while advanced tumors (T4a) at EUS typically results in chemoradiation (in the absence of distant metastases) followed by restaging and surgical resection if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In the 2017 guidelines, T4a tumors now include tumors involving the pleura, pericardium, diaphragm, azygos vein, or peritoneum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>Unresectability is also suggested by EUS in patients with tumors arising above the level of the carina, with extension through the esophageal wall into the mediastinum. It may be difficult or impossible to obtain a safe margin of resection between the tumor and the trachea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bifurcation in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1630970832\"><span class=\"h2\">EUS for preoperative lymph node staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endosonographic criteria that are suggestive of malignant involvement of visible lymph nodes include a width greater than 10 mm, round shape, smooth border, and echo-poor pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66591\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66591 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57813\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57813 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Of these, an echo-poor pattern and width &gt;10 mm appear to be the most specific for malignancy. When all four suspicious features are present in a visualized lymph node, there is an 80 to 100 percent chance of metastatic involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. However, only 25 percent of malignant nodes will have all of these features. These results demonstrate the limitations of EUS criteria for preoperative determination of lymph node staging. Since 2010 lymph node stage is further categorized as according to the number of involved nodes (no involved nodes (N0), 1 or 2 (N1), 3 to 6 (N2), and 7 or more (N3)) involved lymph nodes. Most <span class=\"nowrap\">EUS/CT/PET</span> staging studies have not included this refinement when reporting N staging accuracy.</p><p>As noted above, EUS has an accuracy of more than 80 percent for detecting malignant nodes in the cervical paraesophageal, right recurrent laryngeal, left paratracheal, upper and lower paraesophageal, infra-aortic, infracarinal, lower posterior mediastinal, and perigastric regions. Greater numbers of malignant-appearing periesophageal lymph nodes detected by EUS predicted worse survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].

Direct surgical resection was contraindicated in 77 percent of patients due to detection of advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">locoregional/metastatic</span> disease.</p><p>Optimal criteria for identifying malignant lymph nodes based upon EUS criteria and for helping to select patients for whom EUS FNA is required continue to evolve. Initial experience suggests that a selective approach based upon modified EUS criteria was cost-saving compared with an approach of routine FNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Furthermore, the modified EUS criteria (four standard criteria plus EUS-identified celiac lymph nodes, &gt;5 lymph nodes, or EUS <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/4</span> tumor) were more accurate than standard criteria (hypoechoic, smooth border, round, or width &gt;5 mm) at identifying malignant lymph nodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Interobserver variation and EUS learning curve for esophageal carcinoma staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The accuracy of EUS is operator-dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The available evidence suggests that interobserver reliability (different observers staging the same patients) is influenced by experience and tumor stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/18,56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,56-59</a>]. As a general rule, there is good agreement among experienced endosonographers (defined as &gt;50 EUS examinations in patients with esophageal cancer) for both T and N stage, except for T2 tumors in which agreement was poor. Interobserver reliability was lower when inexperienced endosonographers (&lt;20 EUS examinations in patients with esophageal cancer) were tested. Technical factors, including balloon overinflation causing a blurring of the distinction between the esophageal wall layers, tangential imaging, and inadequate use of higher scanning frequencies (12 MHz), may be responsible for staging errors among inexperienced endosonographers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/57,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,59,60</a>].</p><p>Among expert endosonographers (&gt;75 esophageal cancer examinations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], overstaging of esophageal carcinomas is more frequent than understaging, occurring in 8 to 14 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This is particularly evident in T2 lesions and may be attributed to peritumoral inflammation leading to an overestimation of mural penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In contrast, understaging occurs in 3 to 15 percent of cases and is frequently associated with T3 tumors with microscopic infiltration of the adventitia that is beyond the resolution capabilities of the currently available echoendoscopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/8,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">RESTAGING AFTER NEOADJUVANT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most controversial areas in oncology is the optimal treatment of potentially resectable esophageal cancer, in particular, the benefit of preoperative chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy alone over surgery alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-chemoradiotherapy-neoadjuvant-approaches-and-postoperative-adjuvant-therapy-for-localized-cancers-of-the-esophagus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy, chemoradiotherapy, neoadjuvant approaches, and postoperative adjuvant therapy for localized cancers of the esophagus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multimodality-approaches-to-potentially-resectable-esophagogastric-junction-and-gastric-cardia-adenocarcinomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multimodality approaches to potentially resectable esophagogastric junction and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients who receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy alone, it is frequently desirable to evaluate the response to treatment prior to recommending tumor resection. Unfortunately, the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is limited in this setting. As an example, in a meta-analysis involving 16 studies with 724 patients, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of EUS in staging esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy varied with tumor stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F111616\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111616 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The sensitivity was relatively high in T3 disease (81 percent) while specificity was high in other T stages (T1, T2, and T4). Results did not appreciably change between the periods of 1991 to 2000 and 2001 to 2013 despite introduction of new technology. A possible explanation for the discrepancy between endoscopic and subsequent pathologic staging is that EUS may not be able to differentiate between post-treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammation/fibrosis</span> and residual tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DETECTION OF LOCOREGIONAL RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who present with symptoms or signs worrisome for locoregional recurrence may have a negative endoscopic and radiographic evaluation. In this setting, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is extremely accurate (sensitivity &gt;92 percent and specificity &gt;96 percent) for detecting locoregional relapse, and it should be considered in the work-up of such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>].</p><p>The benefit of EUS for surveillance of resected patients has also been evaluated. In one series of 45 patients who had undergone resection for localized esophageal carcinoma, EUS examination was performed every six months for a period of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The positive predictive value of an abnormal EUS for tumor recurrence was 92 percent, and two-thirds of patients who had tumor relapse documented by EUS were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Although EUS may be an important tool for postoperative surveillance, it is unclear if early detection of tumor recurrence improves survival. In patients with signs or symptoms suspicious for recurrence, EUS with FNA should be performed to establish a diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the most accurate method for locoregional staging of esophageal carcinoma. EUS should be performed in patients being considered for surgery once distant metastases have been excluded by computed tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The addition of EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration has further improved lymph node staging accuracy and should be performed routinely when confirmation of metastatic lymphadenopathy will alter patient therapy.</p><p>Limitations caused by stenotic tumors precluding echoendoscope passage and, therefore, complete staging are being overcome by smaller caliber instruments. Reports comparing EUS with PET support the superior performance of EUS in locoregional staging. Although EUS has a limited role in restaging patients post chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy, it is the most sensitive technique for detecting locoregional tumor recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H564171243\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author and UpToDate would like to thank Dr. Enrique Vazquez-Sequeiros, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-in-esophageal-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Flamen P, Lerut A, Van Cutsem E, et al.
