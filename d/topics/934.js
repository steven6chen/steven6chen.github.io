However, the sympathectomy that accompanies these techniques can lead to <strong>profound hypotension</strong>, especially if the block is established rapidly. Patients who are or have been bleeding should be resuscitated with intravenous (IV) fluid and vasopressors prior to initiation of neuraxial anesthesia. For hemodynamically unstable patients, general anesthesia is preferred. Specifically, lightheadedness or orthostatic hypotension in the sitting position indicate the need for general anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuraxial anesthesia may be contraindicated in patients who develop a dilutional or consumptive coagulopathy as a result of hemorrhage, because of the risk of spinal epidural hematoma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two large-bore IV catheters should be placed for anesthesia for patients with obstetric hemorrhage. The decision to place an intra-arterial catheter for blood pressure (BP) monitoring and blood sampling should be individualized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction of general anesthesia in severely hypovolemic patients can also result in <strong>profound hypotension </strong>and cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-peripartum-hemorrhage/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients should be resuscitated with IV fluid and supported with vasopressors prior to and during induction of general anesthesia. Capable assistance (preferably another anesthesia clinician) should be present during induction for patients with obstetric hemorrhage to maintain uninterrupted IV volume resuscitation and vasopressor administration and to assist with airway management. (See <a href=\"#H4202871619\" class=\"local\">'Induction of anesthesia with postpartum hemorrhage'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid sequence induction and intubation should be performed for general anesthesia. Anticipate difficulty with airway management. Alternative airway management devices (eg, videolaryngoscope, flexible intubating scope) should be available, as well as a plan for a surgical airway, if necessary.

For scheduled, nonurgent cesarean delivery, neuraxial anesthesia is the preferred approach; the choice of anesthetic technique should be based on patient factors.

Catheter-based neuraxial techniques (epidural or combined spinal-epidural [CSE]) may be preferred for cesarean delivery with placenta previa to allow extension of anesthesia for unexpected cesarean hysterectomy. Regardless, a plan should be in place for conversion to general anesthesia in the event of massive postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). (See <a href=\"#H4026646596\" class=\"local\">'Scheduled cesarean hysterectomy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H569768468\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum hemorrhage'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who are actively bleeding or for emergent cesarean delivery, general anesthesia is usually preferred.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An epidural catheter may occasionally be placed even if delivery is not imminent to facilitate rapid initiation of neuraxial anesthesia and avoid general anesthesia (eg, for patients with predicted difficulty with airway management or morbid obesity).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood product preparation </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>An active blood bank sample should be maintained at all times for patients who are hospitalized with placenta previa awaiting delivery. In the United States, the blood type and screen will have to be repeated every three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-peripartum-hemorrhage/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. We crossmatch at least two units of blood for cesarean delivery for these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3363308369\"><span class=\"h2\">Placental abruption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstetric management of patients with abruption may include expectant management, vaginal delivery, or cesarean delivery, depending on maternal and fetal condition and the gestational age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-abruption-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental abruption: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Therefore, labor analgesia or anesthesia for instrumental or cesarean delivery may be required. Anesthetic concerns specific to placental abruption include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial abruption can become complete abruption at any time and may require emergent cesarean delivery or instrumental vaginal delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with abruption are at increased risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-peripartum-hemorrhage/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Increasingly, in obstetric hemorrhage, trauma-related hemorrhage, and other clinical situations, viscoelastic tests (ie, thromboelastography (TEG) and thromboelastometry [ROTEM]) are being used to assess coagulation. TEG and ROTEM are emerging as faster, cheaper, and more efficient than multiple standard coagulation blood tests and equally as effective.

As long as maternal hemodynamics are stable, neuraxial anesthesia may be appropriate, especially if a labor epidural catheter is in place. In cases of acute fetal compromise or severe maternal hypovolemia, general anesthesia is usually preferred. (See <a href=\"#H2016881010\" class=\"local\">'General concerns'</a> above.)</p><p>Hemorrhage may be primarily intra-abdominal and may be difficult to quantify and appreciate. Unexplained hypotension unresponsive to fluid administration or expected doses of vasopressors may suggest concealed hemorrhage, especially with neuraxial analgesia in effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2007469414\"><span class=\"h2\">Vasa previa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasa previa refers to umbilical blood vessels that cross the cervical os, with abnormal, membranous insertion into the placenta. The bleeding from vasa previa is fetal and occurs most commonly when membranes rupture. The fetus can exsanguinate within minutes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Velamentous umbilical cord insertion and vasa previa&quot;, section on 'Vasa previa'</a>.)</p><p>Vasa previa is often diagnosed antenatally, with cesarean delivery scheduled at 34 to 35 weeks of gestation. These patients are often hospitalized between 30 and 34 weeks of gestation and may require emergent cesarean delivery, usually with general anesthesia, if membranes rupture, labor starts, or if fetal heart rate abnormalities occur. Similar to patients with placenta previa, an epidural catheter may occasionally be placed even if delivery is not imminent to facilitate rapid initiation of neuraxial anesthesia and avoid general anesthesia (eg, for patients with predicted difficulty with airway management or morbid obesity).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H569768468\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is an obstetric emergency and is the most common cause of maternal mortality worldwide. In many cases, mortality due to PPH is preventable with appropriate resources and management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage#H100822707\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with PPH require analgesia or anesthesia for surgical interventions and involvement of the anesthesia clinician for hemodynamic and physiologic support. Etiologies for PPH include uterine atony, retained placenta, obstetric trauma (eg, lacerations, tears, uterine rupture), uterine inversion, and placenta accreta. With massive hemorrhage, hysterectomy may be required regardless of the etiology. Patients with hemodynamic instability should be moved to the operating room as soon as practically possible to allow initiation and maintenance of definitive treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H984973859\"><span class=\"h2\">Multidisciplinary care and coordination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of PPH requires a team-based, structured approach. The keys to management of PPH are recognition of excessive bleeding before it becomes life threatening, identification of the cause, and appropriate intervention. We suggest the use of a unit-standard, stage-based obstetric hemorrhage emergency management plan with checklists, as recommended by numerous obstetric and women's health organizations including the National Partnership for Maternal Safety, to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment at the earliest possible stage of PPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-peripartum-hemorrhage/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Standardized definitions that categorize the severity of PPH based on quantified blood loss, vital signs, and uterine tone may improve unit-wide communication and recognition of, and timely intervention for, women experiencing obstetric hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-peripartum-hemorrhage/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. There is no national consensus on strict definitions for stages of obstetric hemorrhage. However, there is consensus that clinicians should create common terminology at the institutional level and that care providers should communicate and manage hemorrhage in terms of stages. An example of a stage-based approach to PPH, with criteria that define each stage, is shown in a table and is described here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110892\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110892 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>Stage 0 begins with delivery of the neonate and refers to normal postpartum bleeding. Stage 1 reflects the initial signs of abnormal uterine bleeding following delivery and should trigger initial bedside interventions (eg, fluids, laceration repair, secondary uterotonics, manual removal of placenta) to establish a diagnosis and treat bleeding. Stage 2 is declared when bleeding continues or the patient continues to have unstable vital signs, despite initial interventions to control it. Stage 2 should trigger escalation of care. Stage 3 represents severe hemorrhage (&gt;1500 mL cumulative blood loss) or coagulopathy, and stage 4 is defined as cardiovascular collapse with massive hemorrhage.</p><p>The anesthesiologist should be involved in all aspects of care at or beyond stage 1 hemorrhage.

(See <a href=\"#H984973859\" class=\"local\">'Multidisciplinary care and coordination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antenatal anesthesia consultation should be arranged for patients at high risk of peripartum hemorrhage. Preanesthesia evaluation should include the usual medical and prenatal history, airway assessment, anesthesia-directed physical examination, and assessment of factors that may make blood transfusion problematic. (See <a href=\"#H107006514\" class=\"local\">'Preanesthesia evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuraxial anesthesia is usually the preferred technique for instrumental and cesarean delivery and for most procedures performed for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). For patients who are or have been bleeding, the following concerns regarding neuraxial anesthesia apply (see <a href=\"#H2016881010\" class=\"local\">'General concerns'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The sympathectomy that accompanies neuraxial anesthesia can cause <strong>profound hypotension</strong> in severely hypovolemic patients. Patients who are or have been bleeding should be resuscitated with intravenous (IV) fluid and vasopressors prior to initiation of neuraxial anesthesia. For hemodynamically unstable patients, general anesthesia is preferred.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neuraxial anesthesia may be contraindicated for patients who develop a dilutional or consumptive coagulopathy because of increased risk of spinal epidural hematoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid sequence induction and intubation should be performed for general anesthesia for PPH. Induction of general anesthesia can also result in <strong>profound hypotension </strong>and cardiac arrest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hypovolemic patients should be resuscitated with IV fluid and supported with vasopressors prior to and during induction of general anesthesia. We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> for induction, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, to minimize the chance of hypotension. (See <a href=\"#H2016881010\" class=\"local\">'General concerns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with placenta previa are at risk for massive hemorrhage before, during, and after delivery and are at increased risk for morbidly adherent placenta. (See <a href=\"#H1594053522\" class=\"local\">'Placenta previa'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placental abruption may cause disseminated intravascular coagulation; a complete blood count and coagulation studies should be performed prior to neuraxial anesthesia for these patients. Placental abruption is also associated with preeclampsia. (See <a href=\"#H3363308369\" class=\"local\">'Placental abruption'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For surgical procedures required to treat PPH, neuraxial anesthesia may be appropriate for patients who are hemodynamically stable without evidence of coagulopathy. (See <a href=\"#H27615985\" class=\"local\">'Neuraxial anesthesia for postpartum hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedation for procedures for PPH should be no deeper than moderate sedation, which means that the patient responds purposefully to verbal commands and maintains and protects her own airway. (See <a href=\"#H2186003965\" class=\"local\">'Moderate sedation/analgesia for postpartum hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending on specific clinical circumstances, cesarean hysterectomy can be performed with general anesthesia, neuraxial anesthesia, or a combination of the two. (See <a href=\"#H3853205816\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anesthetic technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A catheter-based neuraxial anesthetic may be appropriate for cesarean hysterectomy when the anticipated risk of massive blood loss is low. A safe plan should be in place for conversion to general anesthesia if it becomes necessary. (See <a href=\"#H4118617772\" class=\"local\">'Neuraxial anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Controlled preoperative induction of general anesthesia for cesarean hysterectomy is preferred in the following circumstances:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with anticipated difficulty with airway management</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Expectation of difficult or prolonged surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Lack of additional anesthesia clinicians who could assist with conversion to general anesthesia during neuraxial anesthesia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Extreme patient anxiety (see <a href=\"#H3430301761\" class=\"local\">'General anesthesia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive hemorrhage is always possible during cesarean hysterectomy. We prepare for hemorrhage as follows (see <a href=\"#H3060502232\" class=\"local\">'Preparation for transfusion'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We place two large-bore IV catheters for volume administration. We also place a central venous catheter (CVC) or a peripherally inserted central catheter for administration of potent vasopressors and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a>. (See <a href=\"#H3314125774\" class=\"local\">'Venous access'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We coordinate a planned massive transfusion with the blood bank and obtain the first cooler of blood products for storage in the operating suite prior to surgical incision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We consider the use of intraoperative cell salvage.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-peripartum-hemorrhage/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bonnet MP, Deneux-Tharaux C, Bouvier-Colle MH.
