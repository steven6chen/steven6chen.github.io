It typically occurs in children six months to three years of age and is chiefly caused by parainfluenza virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most children with croup who seek medical attention have a mild, self-limited illness and can be successfully managed as outpatients. The clinician must be able to identify children with mild symptoms, who can be safely managed at home, and those with moderate to severe croup or rapidly progressing symptoms, who require full evaluation and possible treatment in the office or emergency department setting. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Severity assessment'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Outpatient treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>There is no definitive treatment for the viruses that cause croup. Pharmacologic therapy is directed toward decreasing airway edema, and supportive care is directed toward the provision of respiratory support and the maintenance of hydration. Corticosteroids and nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> are the cornerstones of therapy; their use is supported by substantial clinical evidence. (See <a href=\"#H95636\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Pharmacologic and supportive interventions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approach to the management of croup will be discussed below. The clinical features and evaluation of croup, and the evidence supporting the use of the pharmacologic and supportive interventions included below are discussed separately.

The first contact with the health care system may occur by phone, and the health care provider must be able to distinguish children with more severe symptoms who need immediate medical attention from those who can be managed at home. (See <a href=\"#H96554194\" class=\"local\">'Telephone triage'</a> below.)</p><p>When the child is seen in the office or emergency department, croup severity is assessed by examining the child and using a clinical scoring system.

Neuromuscular blocking agents should be avoided unless the ability to provide bag-mask ventilation has been demonstrated.
