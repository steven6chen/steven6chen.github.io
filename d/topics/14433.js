This disease is caused by the polyomavirus JC (JCV). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-jc-polyomavirus-bk-polyomavirus-and-other-human-polyomaviruses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of JC polyomavirus, BK polyomavirus, and other human polyomaviruses&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the various approaches that have been employed to treat PML. Other aspects of JC viral infection and PML are discussed elsewhere.

Therefore, the main approach is restoring the host adaptive immune response, a strategy that appears to prolong survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Implementation of this strategy differs according to the clinical setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiating or optimizing effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) for patients with HIV infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Withdrawing immunosuppressive drugs (when possible) for patients without HIV infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinuing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> and starting plasma exchange for patients with natalizumab-associated PML</p><p/><p>Successful restoration of immunity is often accompanied by the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which can be treated with glucocorticoids when there is neurologic deterioration associated with evidence of brain swelling and risk of herniation. (See <a href=\"#H73322935\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory PML'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with HIV infection who have PML, optimization or initiation of effective ART is the best therapeutic option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. PML may improve or stabilize with potent ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], leading to prolonged survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients treated with ART therapy have a one-year survival rate of about 50 percent, compared with approximately 10 percent in those not treated with ART therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The treatment of HIV infection with antiretroviral therapy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-an-antiretroviral-regimen-for-treatment-experienced-hiv-infected-patients-who-are-failing-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting an antiretroviral regimen for treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients who are failing therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppression without HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PML occurs almost exclusively in immunosuppressed individuals. In the absence of HIV infection, PML is rare but is most likely to be found in patients with lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative diseases, solid organ malignancies, granulomatous and inflammatory diseases, and in patients on antirejection immunosuppressive drugs after organ transplantation or patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a>. In addition, PML may develop in individuals with occult or minimal immunosuppression, including those with idiopathic CD4 or CD8 lymphocytopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>In patients without HIV infection who have PML, we recommend discontinuing or decreasing any potential sources of immunosuppression, such as glucocorticoids or calcineurin inhibitors in transplant recipients. The benefit of this intervention is unproven, and is obviously associated with an increased risk of rejection in patients with organ transplants, or relapse in patients with inflammatory diseases. However, possible benefit is suggested by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are case reports of renal transplant recipients who survived PML after immunosuppression was reduced or discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two patients with dermatomyositis who developed PML while on immunosuppressive therapy were noted to improve with regard to the clinical and radiologic manifestations of PML after partial taper or cessation of immunosuppressive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Both patients were also treated with one or more courses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for five days) when the diagnosis of PML was established, and one of them was treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>.</p><p/><p>Another unproven treatment approach is the use of cytokines to boost T cell counts. (See <a href=\"#H1240709531\" class=\"local\">'Interleukin 7'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56321583\"><span class=\"h2\">Natalizumab-associated PML</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Natalizumab</a> treatment for multiple sclerosis is a risk factor for developing PML (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-for-relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natalizumab for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk of PML'</a>). Therefore, natalizumab should be immediately discontinued in patients who develop PML. Although benefit is uncertain as discussed below, we suggest a course of plasma exchange (eg, every other day for a total of five treatments) accompanied by oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> (15 to 45 mg at bed time) for patients with natalizumab-associated PML. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, we suggest high-dose glucocorticoid therapy for patients who develop IRIS and have both marked neurologic deterioration and evidence (clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiologic) of brain swelling. Reasonable regimens include either intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (32 mg daily given in four divided doses) for two weeks, or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (1 g daily for five days), both followed by a slow glucocorticoid taper.</p><p>Empiric treatment with plasma exchange or immunoadsorption or both has been used to treat natalizumab-associated PML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. The rationale is to eliminate circulating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a>, which has a long duration of action that might delay immune reconstitution. However, the evidence is limited to small, retrospective observational studies, and benefit is unproven. In a review of natalizumab-associated PML cases that compared patients who received plasmapheresis (n = 184) with patients who did not (n = 35), there was no evidence of benefit with plasmapheresis for mortality risk or likelihood of poor versus favorable outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>An earlier series reported 15 patients with natalizumab-associated PML who were treated with plasma exchange; the regimen also included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefloquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefloquine</a> for all 15 patients, and high-dose glucocorticoids for 14 who developed IRIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. At a median follow-up of 22 months from PML diagnosis, the survival rate was 100 percent, while disability was rated as mild, moderate, or severe in 20, 60, and 20 percent, respectively. During the acute phase of PML, eight patients developed seizures, and focal epilepsy persisted in four patients at one year despite antiepileptic therapy. Of note, the results of an underpowered randomized trial suggest that mefloquine is not beneficial for PML (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Mefloquine'</a> below), and evidence for mirtazapine is quite limited (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Mirtazapine'</a> below). Therefore, we do not suggest the use of mefloquine in natalizumab-associated PML.</p><p>Clinical features associated with survival in a retrospective series of 336 cases of natalizumab-associated PML were younger age at diagnosis, a lower JC viral load at diagnosis, less disability prior to PML onset, and localized brain lesions on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The following case reports illustrate the clinical course in three survivors: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One patient briefly improved within a week after treatment consisting of plasma exchange, immunoadsorption, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefloquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefloquine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Neurologic improvement followed within four weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another patient continued to deteriorate and developed IRIS at about three weeks after starting plasma exchange and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. At five weeks, he was given intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> for three days to treat new cerebellar lesions attributed to a relapse of multiple sclerosis. The clinical course stabilized six to eight weeks after plasma exchange. Brain MRI showed changes consistent with laminar necrosis, presumably secondary to IRIS.<br/><br/>Both patients partially recovered over months, with residual disabling hemiparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third patient who developed PML was treated with five courses plasma exchange and started on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefloquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefloquine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. One week later, the patient developed IRIS that was treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> for five days and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> for four days. After three months of treatment, the patient had clinically improved to the baseline disability level that was present before the onset of PML, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis by polymerase chain reaction detected no JC virus (JCV).</p><p/><p>In an earlier case report, one patient with multiple sclerosis and PML associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> treatment had significant clinical improvement two weeks after starting treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This improvement was concomitant with a massive inflammatory reaction (IRIS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier in this patient may have promoted the intraparenchymal distribution of cytarabine, which otherwise has a poor central nervous system penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Inflammatory PML'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73322935\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory PML</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although antiretroviral therapy has improved the survival of patients with HIV infection who have PML, it has also been associated with new onset or clinical worsening of PML. This occurs mainly in patients with HIV infection who display a marked increase in CD4-positive T-cell counts and a decrease in HIV plasma viral load, indicating a recovery of the immune system. This paradoxical development of PML is usually accompanied by an inflammatory reaction in PML lesions known as the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) and demonstrated by contrast enhancement on brain MRI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to patients with HIV infection and PML, most patients with natalizumab-associated PML develop some degree of IRIS approximately three to six weeks after plasma exchange or immunoadsorption. Furthermore, IRIS can occur in patients with PML weeks to months after discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">natalizumab</a> even when plasma exchange or immunoadsorption are not employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In one report of 35 patients of natalizumab-associated PML, IRIS developed in approximately 90 percent, usually within weeks after stopping natalizumab and starting treatment with plasma exchange or immunoadsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. IRIS usually presented with subacute onset of new symptoms or with worsening of symptoms attributed to PML. The mean time from initiation of plasma exchange or immunoadsorption to the onset of IRIS was just over 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Most of the reported patients who developed IRIS in this setting had severe cases and were treated with high-dose glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. IRIS also developed several months after stopping natalizumab in a patient who was not treated with plasma exchange or immunoadsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Although the available data are limited, as summarized below, we suggest high-dose glucocorticoid therapy for patients who develop inflammatory PML (ie, PML-IRIS) when there is both marked neurologic deterioration and clinical or radiologic evidence of brain swelling, which can lead to mass effect, brain herniation, and death. Reasonable regimens include either intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (32 mg daily given in four divided doses) for two weeks, or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (1 g daily for five days), both followed by a slow glucocorticoid taper. High-dose glucocorticoids can be given without temporary interruption of ART therapy.</p><p>Weak retrospective evidence supports the use of glucocorticoid therapy for patients who have inflammatory PML and neurologic deterioration associated with evidence of brain swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In a review of 54 patients with PML and IRIS, 12 patients were treated with glucocorticoids, most often for catastrophic deterioration or for evidence of brain inflammation on neuroimaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The overall mortality was 35 percent, and the following additional outcomes were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comparing the groups treated (n = 12) and not treated (n = 42) with glucocorticoids, there were no statistically significant differences on any baseline or outcome measure, including duration of survival or mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the 12 patients treated with glucocorticoids, 7 survived with good neurologic recovery, and 5 died. Comparing survivors with nonsurvivors, several trends were observed:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Survivors received glucocorticoids earlier after the recognition of IRIS (mean 3 versus 12.3 weeks), received longer courses of glucocorticoids (mean 13.3 versus 3 weeks), and were tapered off glucocorticoids more slowly. However, these differences were <strong>not</strong> statistically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Survivors were nonsignificantly more likely to have contrast enhancement of PML-IRIS on brain MRI scan (six of seven versus one of five).</p><p/><p>Since glucocorticoids are immunosuppressants, we suggest <strong>not</strong> treating patients who have inflammatory PML with glucocorticoids unless there is major neurologic worsening associated with clinical or radiologic evidence of brain swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56322066\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of medications have been used to treat PML based upon earlier anecdotal evidence of efficacy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a>) or hypothetical mechanisms impeding the JCV (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topotecan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topotecan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefloquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefloquine</a>) and the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maraviroc-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">maraviroc</a>). However, among those tested in randomized trials or prospective studies (ie, cytarabine, cidofovir, and mefloquine), none has shown clinical benefit. Evidence for the remainder comes from only small numbers of patients with PML. Therefore, these drugs are <strong>not</strong> considered effective treatment for PML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Cytarabine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a randomized controlled trial involving 57 patients with HIV infection and biopsy-confirmed PML, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> administered either intravenously or intrathecally did not improve prognosis compared with antiretroviral therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In addition, an open label study involving 19 patients who had PML without HIV infection found that intravenous cytarabine 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for five days appeared to stabilize the neurologic and functional status of 7 patients (36 percent) at 2 to 4.5 years of follow-up, despite significant bone marrow toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The patients in this study had a variety of underlying conditions, including Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, dermatomyositis, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, heart and liver transplantation, and vasculitis.

In a nationwide Danish cohort study of all patients &ge;16 years old with HIV infection, the median survival time increased from 0.4 years (95% CI 0.0-0.7) in those diagnosed with PML before 1997 (pre-ART era) to 1.8 years (95% CI 0.9-2.6) in those diagnosed with PML from 1997 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].
