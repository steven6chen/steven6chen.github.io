Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall incidence of PAPVC is estimated to be 0.7 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, as this rate is based upon autopsy data, the true prevalence of PAPVC may actually be higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Multiple case series report PAPVC as an incidental finding, which in most of these instances is asymptomatic.</p><p>Although PAPVC can present as an isolated structural abnormality, it commonly occurs with other cardiac abnormalities, most often an atrial septal defect. In addition, patients with Turner syndrome are at increased risk for PAPVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC VARIATIONS OF PULMONARY VENOUS RETURN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a wide range of pulmonary vein arrangements that return blood from the lung to the heart.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Normal variants</strong> &ndash; Normal variants return blood from the pulmonary circulation directly to the left atrium. The most common arrangement involves two left and two right pulmonary veins that form separate orifices and connect directly to the posterior wall of the left atrium. In the second most common variant, pulmonary veins from the entire right or left lung form a single confluent vessel before it connects into the left atrium, thereby forming a single orifice for an entire lung. In more uncommon cases, there can be a total of five or more pulmonary vein connections, each draining a correspondingly smaller segment of lung, but all connecting normally to the left atrium. These variations in the number of normal connections have no clinical impact.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC)</strong> &ndash; TAPVC is a cyanotic congenital defect in which all four pulmonary veins fail to make their normal connection to the left atrium. This results in drainage of all pulmonary venous return into the systemic venous circulation. There are four variants of TAPVCs based upon the anatomical location of the anomalous connection: supracardiac (typically a vertical vein connecting to the innominate vein), cardiac (to the right atrium or coronary sinus), infracardiac, or mixed connection(s) at two or more levels. TAPVC is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection (PAPVC)</strong> &ndash; PAPVC occurs when one or more, but not all, of the pulmonary veins return directly to the right atrium or indirectly through a variety of venous connections from a pulmonary vein to a systemic vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">PAPVC consists of two subtypes based upon their anatomy, which are discussed in the following sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In PAPVCs, the anomalous vein connects with a systemic vein resulting in the mixing of oxygenated blood from the pulmonary circulation with the systemic venous blood before returning to the right side of the heart.</p><p>In the most common form of PAPVC, the left upper pulmonary vein connects to the left innominate vein, which in turn drains into the superior vena cava (SVC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57752\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef57752 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p>In another variant, small segments of the right upper lobe connect directly to the SVC, usually at or above the level of the azygous vein. Because of the location of the pulmonary vein connection, this anatomy is different from that of sinus venosus defects. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Sinus venosus defects'</a> below.)</p><p>Other less-common forms of PAPVC include anomalous pulmonary vein connections to the coronary sinus, azygous vein, or the inferior vena cava (IVC).</p><p>In PAPVCs, a secundum atrial septal defect is typically present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Scimitar syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scimitar syndrome is a variant PAPVC in which part or even the entire right lung is drained by right pulmonary veins that connect anomalously to the IVC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51495\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51495 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52567\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef52567 \">movie 2</a>). The affected lung and its associated airways, which are drained by the scimitar vein, are often hypoplastic or have unusual bronchial or vascular distribution patterns. Sequestration as well as aortopulmonary collateral vessels may also involve the affected lung. Other cardiac defects are commonly seen and often include hypoplasia of the left heart or aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Left-sided scimitar syndrome has also been described, where some or all of the left pulmonary veins connect to the right-sided IVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>A chest radiograph may show the shadow of these veins as they course and coalesce towards the diaphragm and the IVC, giving the characteristic &quot;scimitar&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67663\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67663 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>Symptomatic infants with this diagnosis tend to present with more severe disease and have a poorer prognosis than patients who present as adults or children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. At the time of diagnosis, most affected infants have pulmonary hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Presentation of scimitar syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, the involved pulmonary vein(s) connect directly to the left atrium in an anatomically normal position. However, due to other intracardiac defects (eg, sinus venosus defects), oxygenated blood from the anomalous vein can either enter only the right atrium or course into the left and right atria simultaneously. In either case, there is return of oxygenated blood to the right side of the heart, which mixes with the systemic venous blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Sinus venosus defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normally, the right upper pulmonary vein courses behind the SVC and part of the right atrium before connecting to the left atrium. A sinus venosus defect occurs when there is an absence or unroofing of the wall that normally separates the right upper pulmonary vein from the SVC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73621\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73621 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53750\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef53750 \">movie 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This anomaly results in the right pulmonary vein draining into the SVC or in the right and left atria.</p><p>Inferior sinus venosus defects are an uncommon form of interatrial communications that can lead to the impression of anomalously draining right pulmonary vein(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Malposition of the septum primum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anomalous drainage of one or more normally connecting pulmonary veins results from leftward malposition of the septum primum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this rare condition, the posterior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> superior attachments of the atrial septum primum are shifted so far leftward that the pulmonary veins from the right lung drain into the right atrium rather than to the left atrium. This anomaly is associated with heterotaxy syndrome and polysplenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PAPVC results in recirculation of already oxygenated pulmonary venous blood through the pulmonary vasculature (left-to-right shunting). In patients with isolated PAPVC (no other associated cardiac anomaly), the magnitude of the shunt is dependent upon the proportion of anomalous draining blood compared with the total pulmonary venous return. This is usually dependent upon the following factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number and size of anomalous pulmonary veins involved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pulmonary segment or lobes from which the anomalous veins originate because of differences in the distribution of blood flow to each lung <span class=\"nowrap\">segment/lobe</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relative resistance of the normal and abnormal pulmonary veins and the compliance of the respective receiving chambers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p>Significant shunting is associated with two or more anomalous connecting veins that may cause enlargement of the right atrium and ventricles, and dilation of the pulmonary artery. Patients with single pulmonary vein involvement are generally asymptomatic and do not have significant hemodynamic and cardiac structural changes.

In these patients, the clinical findings are similar to those seen in individuals with ASD and correspond to the degree of shunting from both the ASD and PAPVC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-atrial-septal-defects-asds-and-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-isolated-asds-in-children#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of atrial septal defects (ASDs), and clinical features and diagnosis of isolated ASDs in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a small degree of shunting are usually asymptomatic and are often identified incidentally by a murmur detected on physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although patients with moderate to large shunts may be asymptomatic in childhood, left-to-right shunting increases with age, and symptoms may appear generally during early adulthood before 40 years of age. Symptoms start with dyspnea and fatigue and may progress to heart failure depending upon the degree of shunting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In symptomatic patients, the severity of findings is dependent upon the degree of shunting, and the presence of pulmonary hypertension or other cardiac anomalies. Clinical findings include dyspnea on exertion, recurrent pneumonia, and heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Presentation of scimitar syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of scimitar syndrome varies depending upon the age of diagnosis. Patients who present as infants have more severe symptoms related to heart failure and other cardiac and pulmonary conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Symptoms in infants with scimitar syndrome include tachypnea, poor feeding, failure to thrive, cyanosis, and lethargy.</p><p>Approximately one-half of older patients who are diagnosed after the first year of life remain asymptomatic and are typically identified by an incidental finding on chest radiograph. In other patients, there is a range of symptoms that includes fatigue, dyspnea, and recurrent pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Other associated anomalies are common in patients with scimitar syndrome and include ASD, pulmonary sequestration, hypoplastic lung, dextrocardia, pulmonary vein stenosis, and other cardiac anomalies (eg, coarctation of the aorta, ventricular septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Children with scimitar syndrome have a high rate of respiratory complications. In a study of 81 patients, 38 percent of the group had pulmonary infections and 43 percent reported a wheezing episode during the last 12 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolated PAPVC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with isolated PAPVC, no hemodynamic abnormality is generally noted unless 50 percent or more of the pulmonary blood flow is recirculated back to the pulmonary vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, individuals with a single anomalous pulmonary vein usually are asymptomatic and have a normal life span.</p><p>In patients with isolated multiple pulmonary vein involvement, signs and symptoms are dependent upon the degree of left-to-right shunting and are similar to those seen in patients with an uncomplicated ASD or in cases of PAPVC that are associated with an ASD.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Scimitar syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial diagnosis of PAPVC may be made by echocardiography. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or cardiac catheterization. Other tests, including chest radiography and electrocardiogram, may provide supportive evidence for the diagnosis of PAPVC but are not diagnostic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography is the most frequently used method for an initial diagnosis of PAPVC. PAPVC should be considered when the echocardiography demonstrates unexpected right atrial or ventricular enlargement, especially if there are no other explanations for the finding(s) (eg, secundum atrial septal defect). In cases with right heart enlargement, PAPVC is inferred if there are fewer than four pulmonary veins connecting to the left atrium, although one must consider the possibility of a single pulmonary vein draining an entire lung.</p><p>In addition, PAPVC should be considered if the superior vena cava (SVC), innominate vein, or inferior vena cava (IVC) appears dilated, and no other clear explanations are present. In these cases, the anomalous pulmonary vein may connect directly to these structures.</p><p>Color flow mapping and other Doppler techniques may aid the identification of anomalous connections to the innominate vein, SVC and IVC, or right atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73621\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73621 \">movie 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in detecting PAPVC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73621\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef73621 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53750\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef53750 \">movie 4</a>) and heart chamber enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, TEE is not usually employed to evaluate the superior-most aspect of the SVC or innominate veins; these structures are better evaluated using TTE.</p><p>A potential limitation of echocardiography is the availability of acoustic windows. Vessels that cross behind large airways such as the mainstem bronchi are masked due to attenuation of the ultrasound beams. In some patients, especially those with chronic lung disease, the anterior and medial margins of the lungs can mask the areas of interest. Distinguishing between a secundum atrial septal defect and a sinus venosus defect, with or without anomalous pulmonary vein connections, is sometimes challenging. While TEE can circumvent some of the issues with poor acoustic windows, it also can be subject to the same problems when the airways obscure areas of interest as TTE.</p><p>Prenatal diagnosis of PAPVC by fetal echocardiography is feasible and has been reported in a large tertiary care center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], although its predictive value remains to be fully defined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is becoming more widely available as a cardiovascular diagnostic technique. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CMR has increasingly been used to diagnose and characterize congenital heart disease, including PAPVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. It can provide additional information, including quantitation of heart chamber volumes, ventricular mass, and blood flow through the great vessels, when other modalities, such as echocardiography, yield equivocal findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>There are several techniques used in CMR including the following, which are particularly useful in the diagnosis of PAPVC:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MR angiography (MRA) typically uses gadolinium-based intravenous contrast agents and provides enhanced visualization of the pulmonary vasculature including the anomalous pulmonary vein(s) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51495\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51495 \">image 1</a>). In patients with renal failure, CMR is capable of viewing vascular structures without intravenous contrast, though the diagnostic accuracy may be suboptimal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phase velocity mapping, a variant of gradient echo, is another technique that is used to directly measure blood flow. It can measure the ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow noninvasively, also known as shunt volume or Qp:Qs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In patients with PAPVC, this ratio increases with the degree of left-to-right shunting.</p><p/><p>The optimal use of CMR is in cooperative patients who can lie still, as ideal images are obtained in patients who are able to hold their breath. CMR imaging in young children or anxious patients often requires conscious sedation or even general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) can be used to confirm PAPVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. CCT has several advantages over other diagnostic modalities. It provides more detailed anatomic information than echocardiography and like CMR is not limited by narrow acoustic windows. CCT is more readily available than CMR. It can be performed in a shorter period of time than CMR and, as a result, may eliminate the need for anesthesia or sedation in younger patients. If necessary, contrast can be given after noncontrast images have been obtained to provide additional anatomic detail including enhanced visualization of the pulmonary vasculature. However, the benefits of CCT must be balanced with the known long-term risks of ionizing radiation, especially in small children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac catheterization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although cardiac catheterization can be a definitive diagnostic procedure, it is increasingly performed as a therapeutic intervention to occlude small anomalous connections rather than for diagnosis because of the availability of other diagnostic modalities (ie, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography) in patients with PAPVC. Cardiac catheterization also provides hemodynamic information, such as pulmonary vascular resistance, cardiac output, and ventricular pressures. Shunt volume can be calculated by oximetry, but some authors have questioned its reliability in PAPVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/partial-anomalous-pulmonary-venous-connection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], since mixed venous saturation can be difficult to measure, especially if the anomalous vein drains directly into the SVC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with PAPVC, the electrocardiogram may demonstrate evidence of right heart enlargement or right ventricular hypertrophy.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic variations of pulmonary venous return'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PAPVC results in recirculation of pulmonary venous blood through the pulmonary vasculature (left-to-right shunting). The amount of shunted pulmonary blood flow is dependent upon the number and size of anomalous pulmonary veins involved. Significant shunting is associated with two or more anomalous connecting veins, which may result in enlargement of the right atrium and ventricle, and dilation of the pulmonary artery. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of PAPVC is related to the degree of left-to-right shunting and the presence of other associated cardiac and pulmonary defects. Atrial septal defect (ASD) is present in most patients with PAPVC. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with hemodynamically insignificant shunting are generally asymptomatic and are identified incidentally by echocardiography performed for other indications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with greater degrees of shunting may present with dyspnea and fatigue that may progress to heart failure as left-to-right shunting increases with age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scimitar syndrome is a variant PAPVC, in which part or even the entire right lung is drained by right pulmonary veins that connect anomalously to the inferior vena cava (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51495\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51495 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52567\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef52567 \">movie 2</a>). Infants who present with this syndrome have more severe diseases (heart failure, recurrent pulmonary infections, pulmonary hypertension, and pulmonary and cardiac anomalies) than patients who present after one year of life. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Scimitar syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Presentation of scimitar syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial diagnosis of PAPVC may be made by echocardiography. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or cardiac catheterization. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is the definitive treatment for PAPVC. However, asymptomatic patients with small left-to-right shunt do not require intervention, as the defect has no significant clinical impact, and life expectancy is normal without correction. The benefit of surgical intervention must be weighed against the risk of the procedure. The surgical procedure varies and is dependent upon the involved anatomy and the presence of other associated cardiac anomalies. Transcatheter occlusion may be used to reduce the shunting in selected cases. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the exception of infants with scimitar syndrome, the outcome for patients with PAPVC generally is excellent, including those who undergo surgical correction. Patients with scimitar syndrome who present as infants have historically had poor outcome with considerable morbidity and mortality. This is likely related to the higher incidence of coexisting congenital heart disease, extracardiac anomalies, and pulmonary hypertension in scimitar syndrome compared with other forms of PAPVC.
