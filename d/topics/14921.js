The lesions are typically 3 to 5 mm, round to oval ulcers with a peripheral rim of erythema and a yellowish adherent exudate centrally. The process may range in severity, with some patients noting only an occasional lesion and others experiencing such frequent episodes that they have almost continuous ulcer activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and management of RAS.

In North America, it occurs approximately in one out of five individuals and is the most common cause of acute recurrent oral ulcers. Most individuals first develop RAS during adolescence, although it is not uncommonly seen in children. The disease may continue into adulthood but typically wanes with increasing age. It is unusual for patients over the age of 40 to develop new-onset RAS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H198913516\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2011564732\"><span class=\"h2\">Simple aphthosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RAS is referred to as simple aphthosis (also called Mikulicz ulcers) when the individual experiences several episodes per year involving one to several ulcers lasting up to 14 days and limited to the oral mucosa. This is the most common form of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H665672106\"><span class=\"h2\">Complex aphthosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In &quot;complex aphthosis,&quot; the patient may have involvement of both the oral and genital mucosa, although oral lesions are more common. The lesions are more numerous, more painful, and larger (&gt;1 cm in diameter), often taking up to four to six weeks to resolve. Some patients with complex aphthosis will have such frequent episodes that they are almost never without at least one active ulcer. In patients with complex aphthosis, the diagnosis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome must be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

Most investigations have supported the concept of immune dysregulation involving the oral mucosa leading to an exaggerated proinflammatory process <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a relatively weak anti-inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>]. There appears to be a genetic predisposition to developing RAS, as it is common for patients to have a family history of RAS. </p><p>Although certain foods may exacerbate RAS, there is no evidence to suggest an etiologic role for food allergy. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of RAS, particularly deficiency of vitamin B12, although the role of vitamin supplementation in the treatment of RAS remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Infectious etiologies have been explored, but not documented, to be a direct cause of disease. Many patients with RAS observe pathergy, so that any trauma to the lining of the mouth may result in the development of an ulcer in that location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19</a>]. Emotional stress will frequently lead to an exacerbation of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Certain drugs have been documented to induce oral ulcers similar to aphthous ulcers. The ulcers typically resolve when the drug is discontinued. Although a few observational studies reported a temporary increase of RAS in the first few weeks after smoking cessation, other studies have not found an association between RAS and smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/7,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3152628500\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions of RAS have a very characteristic appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. The ulcers are discrete, round to oval with an erythematous rim and adherent yellowish exudate centrally. Patients with simple aphthosis typically have one to five discrete ulcers limited to the oral mucosa that are &lt;1 cm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63475%7EDERM%2F114283%7EDERM%2F114284\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63475 graphicRef114283 graphicRef114284 \">picture 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In some patients with simple RAS, however, ulcers may be larger than 1 cm or, infrequently, 1 to 3 mm in diameter and occurring in clusters (herpetiform ulcers). Patients with complex aphthosis often present with large ulcers (&gt;1 cm in diameter) but will typically also have smaller lesions similar to those seen in simple aphthosis. The episodes of ulcers are frequent and the duration more prolonged. Lesions may involve both the oral and genital areas. </p><p>The oral lesions in RAS most commonly develop on the buccal and labial mucosae. The gingival sulci, lateral and ventral tongue, soft palate, and anterior pharynx may also be involved. Although ulcers are predominantly found on the nonmasticatory mucosal surfaces, they may also be seen on the hard palate and attached gingivae.</p><p>A lesion typically progresses from a painful, pinpoint papule into an ulcer over a period of one to two days; the ulcer gradually expands to its final size over the next three to four days and then stabilizes before beginning to heal. In some patients, lesions may come and go within four to five days, but in most individuals, they resolve in 10 to 14 days. Patients who experience frequent episodes are often able to identify lesions in the early phase, which can be useful in terms of initiating therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Many patients with RAS experience an exacerbation of their disease following trauma to the oral mucosa, such as biting the inside of the cheek or undergoing a dental procedure. In these patients, one or more ulcers will predictably develop in the area of trauma over the next couple of days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19</a>].</p><p>Most patients with RAS first experience oral ulcers during the<sup> </sup>second and<sup> </sup>third decades of life. They may continue to develop lesions through middle age, but the frequency typically diminishes.</p><p>Although patients may be very uncomfortable, few experience systemic symptoms or signs associated with outbreaks of their aphthous ulcers. The routine presence of fever, malaise, or other systemic manifestations should raise the suspicion of an autoinflammatory disease such as <strong>p</strong>eriodic <strong>f</strong>ever, <strong>a</strong>phthous stomatitis, <strong>p</strong>haryngitis, and <strong>a</strong>denopathy (PFAPA) syndrome; cyclic neutropenia; or hyperimmunoglobulin D (hyper IgD) syndrome.

However, typical findings of an active ulcer would be epithelial necrosis and a neutrophilic infiltrate centrally. At the periphery, the infiltrate is predominantly lymphocytic with some exocytosis and epithelial degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Direct immunofluorescence is nonspecific, with possible deposition of C3 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunoglobulin M in blood vessels. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3682988628\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2410412195\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of RAS is typically made clinically, based on patient history and physical examination. A history of recurrent, self-limited ulcers of the oral mucosa that demonstrate the characteristic appearance of discrete, round to oval ulcers with an erythematous rim and yellowish exudate is generally sufficient to make the diagnosis of simple aphthosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18679463\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients often begin experiencing ulcers during adolescence and early adulthood. They may develop one to several lesions at a time that are self-limited in nature. A history of lesions persisting for several days up to several weeks and then resolving is characteristic of RAS. The ulcers may be very painful and, in some cases, may interfere with the ability to eat, drink, and talk. Although some patients may report such frequent episodes that they almost always have at least one ulcer present, the individual lesions heal completely. Most patients will go for weeks to months between episodes. The history of developing an ulcer at a site of trauma is very common in patients with RAS.</p><p>Below is a list of suggested questions for patients with oral ulcers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the natural history of the lesions?

They have an erythematous halo at the margin and a yellowish exudate centrally. They may be found throughout the oral mucosa but are especially common on the buccal and labial mucosae and the lateral and ventral tongue. Lesions in the genital area are similar in appearance but may develop on both the mucosal and cutaneous areas of the vulva, distal vagina, scrotum, and penis. When evaluating the patient with oral ulcers, it is recommended that a physical exam of all mucocutaneous surfaces, including scalp, nails, and anogenital region, be performed to exclude other underlying skin disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1417519820\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of RAS is typically made clinically. However, in more severe or atypical presentations, a biopsy may be useful to rule out an alternate mucosal process. A shave biopsy at the periphery of an early ulcerative lesion is the most useful. However, a biopsy does not help distinguish RAS from Beh&ccedil;et syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. If the disease is extensive enough to mimic an autoimmune bullous disease such as pemphigus vulgaris or cicatricial pemphigoid, performing a biopsy for direct immunofluorescence examination may be helpful.

A complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and assessment of nutritional deficiencies (eg, vitamin B12, folate, iron) may reveal a disorder that, when corrected, could potentially lead to resolution or improvement of the ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/10,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,26</a>].

Although these modalities may provide a rapid relief of the pain associated with RAS, their efficacy in reducing the healing time and preventing new episodes of RAS remains uncertain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3321288140\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis for patients with simple aphthosis is excellent. It is a self-limited disease that can periodically result in moderate discomfort but is otherwise well tolerated. In a minority of patients with complex aphthosis, the pain and frequency of outbreaks may have a significant impact on the overall quality of life. The use of systemic medications for symptomatic control can be associated with both short- and long-term side effects. Fortunately, both forms of RAS tend to improve as patients age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1733884228\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is a common disease of the oral mucosa characterized by the recurrent development of one to several discrete, painful ulcers that typically heal within two weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63475%7EDERM%2F114283%7EDERM%2F114284\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63475 graphicRef114283 graphicRef114284 \">picture 1A-C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1250542269\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RAS is classified as simple aphthosis and complex aphthosis. Simple aphthosis is the more common form of the disease. Patients experience several self-limited episodes per year, and involvement is limited to the oral mucosa. Patients with complex aphthosis may have involvement of both the oral and genital mucosa. The lesions are more numerous, more painful, and larger, often taking up to four to six weeks to resolve. (See <a href=\"#H198913516\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of RAS is usually made on clinical grounds, based upon a typical history and physical exam. Most patients are otherwise healthy. In patients with more severe or recalcitrant disease, it is appropriate to evaluate for underlying disease. In patients with complex aphthosis, the diagnosis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome must be excluded. Biopsy of a lesion will not distinguish between these two entities. (See <a href=\"#H3682988628\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H238686915\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no uniformly effective therapy for RAS. General measures aimed at oral hygiene, avoidance of trauma to the oral mucosa, and use of topical pain relievers are appropriate for all patients with RAS. (See <a href=\"#H2068068876\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with simple aphthosis, we suggest topical corticosteroids as first-line therapy rather than other topical agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Other topical agents that can be used as an alternative or in combination with topical corticosteroids include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a> suspension and amlexanox (not available in the United States). Based on limited clinical trial data, these agents appear to be safe, and they appear to improve pain and ulcer healing compared with placebo. No specific therapy is also a reasonable alternative since many patients improve with general measures alone. (See <a href=\"#H2248999040\" class=\"local\">'Patients with simple aphthosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with complex RAS, we suggest systemic oral corticosteroids, in addition to topical corticosteroids, as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If the episodes are frequent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe despite treatment with oral corticosteroids, other treatment options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, or a combination of both drugs. We typically start with colchicine and add dapsone if there is inadequate response to the colchicine alone <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> only a low dose of colchicine is tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H1787241878\" class=\"local\">'Patients with complex aphthosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other systemic agents that have been used with some success in patients with severe recalcitrant RAS include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha agents. (See <a href=\"#H3703025791\" class=\"local\">'Other therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients, RAS resolves or subsides spontaneously with age. In a minority of patients with complex aphthosis, the pain and frequency of outbreaks may have a significant impact on the overall quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H3321288140\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrent-aphthous-stomatitis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Edgar NR, Saleh D, Miller RA.
