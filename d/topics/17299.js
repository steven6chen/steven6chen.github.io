The infection is often contracted from another human or an animal through direct contact.</p><p>Tinea capitis primarily occurs in children. The most common clinical findings are single or multiple scaly patches with alopecia and patches of alopecia with black dots at follicular orifices that represent broken hairs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86686%7EDERM%2F101630%7EDERM%2F101858%7EDERM%2F101271%7EDERM%2F101859%7EDERM%2F86628\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86686 graphicRef101630 graphicRef101858 graphicRef101271 graphicRef101859 graphicRef86628 \">picture 1A-F</a>).

Children, particularly prepubertal children, are most likely to develop tinea capitis. Some studies have identified higher prevalences in male children than in female children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]; however, other studies have not corroborated this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Occasionally, adults develop tinea capitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].</p><p>Tinea capitis occurs worldwide with prevalences that vary geographically and demographically. Studies in the United States have revealed that tinea capitis is most common in African-American children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. The reason for this is unknown. Theories to explain this observation have included effects of socioeconomic factors or differences in genetic susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420839731\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tinea capitis is a dermatophyte infection. Dermatophytes are filamentous fungi in the genera <em>Trichophyton</em>, <em>Microsporum</em>,<em> </em>and<em> Epidermophyton</em> that infect keratinized tissue of skin, hair, or nails. Organisms in the <em>Trichophyton</em> and <em>Microsporum</em> genera generally cause tinea capitis. Tinea capitis due to <em>Epidermophyton</em> species is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Dermatophytes are divided into anthropophilic (human), zoophilic (animal), and geophilic (soil) fungi. Anthropophilic and zoophilic dermatophytes are the most common causes of tinea capitis. Examples of dermatophyte species associated with tinea capitis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anthropophilic</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Trichophyton</em> <em>tonsurans</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</em> var. <em>interdigitale</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Trichophyton violaceum</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Trichophyton soudanense</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Trichophyton</em> schoenleinii</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Microsporum audouinii</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Epidermophyton floccosum</em> (rare) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Trichophyton rubrum</em> (rare)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Zoophilic</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Microsporum canis</em> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Trichophyton verrucosum</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Trichophyton equinum</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Microsporum nanum</em></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Geophilic</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Microsporum gypseum</em></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Microsporum fulvum</em></p><p/><p>The likelihood that a particular dermatophyte is the cause of tinea capitis varies geographically and evolves over time. In the United States and the United Kingdom, <em>T. tonsurans</em> has replaced <em>M. canis</em> as the most common causative organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. <em>T. tonsurans</em> is also the predominant cause of tinea capitis in Canada, Brazil, France, and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. <em>M. canis </em>remains a primary cause of tinea capitis in central and southern Europe, Russia, Australia, and China; however, shifts in the predominating cause of tinea capitis to <em>T. violaceum</em> or other organisms have been noted in some areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/4,6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,16</a>]. <em>M. audouinii</em> and <em>T. soudanense</em> are primary causes of tinea capitis in West Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. <em>T. verrucosum</em> is a common cause of tinea capitis in Turkey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420839737\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tinea capitis is acquired through contact of the scalp with the causative dermatophyte. Acquisition of the fungus may result from direct contact with an infected individual or animal or from contact with a contaminated object (eg, comb, brush, or hat). Contact with asymptomatic carriers of causative organisms is an additional mode of transmission that may play an important role in recurrences of tinea capitis and tinea corporis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1384653175\" class=\"local\">'Management of close contacts'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1540870631\" class=\"local\">'Treatment failure'</a> below.)</p><p>Once the dermatophyte comes in contact with the stratum corneum on the scalp, the establishment of infection is mediated by a variety of factors. As an example, mannan glycoproteins in dermatophyte cell walls promote adherence of dermatophytes to keratin-containing host tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, production of proteolytic enzymes, such as keratinase, by the dermatophytes enables invasion of the cytokeratin-containing tissues of the skin and hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The infection progresses from the stratum corneum of the epidermis, extending down the follicle and to the hair. Biofilms can form, which may make therapy more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Dermatophyte infection of the hair may present in three forms, <strong>endothrix</strong> infection, <strong>ectothrix</strong> infection, and <strong>favus</strong>. In endothrix infections, arthroconidia (fungal spores) are found within the hair shaft on direct microscopic examination. Common examples include <em>T. tonsurans, T. violaceum</em>,<em> and T. soudanense</em> infections. In ectothrix infections, arthroconidia primarily surround the outside of the hair shaft. Dermatophytes often associated with ectothrix infections include <em>T. verrucosum</em>, <em>M. canis, M. audouinii</em>, <em>M. nanum</em>,<em> and M. gypseum</em>. Favus is a unique presentation in which hyphae and air spaces are found within hair shafts. (See <a href=\"#H420839882\" class=\"local\">'Potassium hydroxide preparation'</a> below.)</p><p>The innate immune system likely plays a significant role in host defense against dermatophyte infection. An in vitro study evaluating the role of inflammasomes, components of the innate immune system, found evidence to suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in host defense against <em>M. canis</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The reasons for the predominance of tinea capitis in children are not well understood. Proposed theories to explain the infrequency in adults include effects related to the fungistatic properties of short- and medium-chain fatty acids in postpubertal sebum and the colonization of adults by commensal yeasts, such as <em>Pityrosporum</em>, that may inhibit infection with dermatophytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H949998211\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tinea capitis may present with a variety of clinical features. There are five major clinical variants of tinea capitis as well as an asymptomatic carrier state. The causative organism and the host immune response to infection influence the clinical presentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1140644340\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common clinical manifestations of tinea capitis are the development of scaly patches with alopecia and patches of alopecia with visible black dots. Diffuse scalp scaling with subtle hair loss, kerion, and favus are additional clinical variants. Pruritus is a common associated symptom in the various presentations of tinea capitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scaly patches with alopecia </strong>&ndash; Single or multiple scaly patches with hair loss are a common presentation of ectothrix infections (eg, <em>M. canis</em>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86686%7EDERM%2F101630%7EDERM%2F101858%7EDERM%2F101271%7EDERM%2F101859\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86686 graphicRef101630 graphicRef101858 graphicRef101271 graphicRef101859 \">picture 1A-E</a>). Individual patches are often a few centimeters to several centimeters in diameter. The patches enlarge centrifugally over the course of weeks to months. Erythema may be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patches of alopecia with black dots </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Endothrix infections may present with manifestations often referred to as &quot;black dot tinea capitis.&quot; Multiple black dots, which represent the distal ends of hairs that have broken at the surface of the scalp, are present at follicular orifices within areas of alopecia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86628\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86628 \">picture 1F</a>). The broken hairs are a result of weakening of the hair shaft secondary to the endothrix infection. The alopecic areas may be single or multiple and typically range from a few centimeters to several centimeters in diameter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Widespread scaling with subtle hair loss </strong>&ndash; Tinea capitis may exhibit diffuse scaling on the scalp without clear areas of alopecia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101860\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101860 \">picture 4</a>). This presentation may closely resemble seborrheic dermatitis and may be due to unknown host factors leading to less hair loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Kerion</strong> &ndash; Kerion is a severe manifestation of tinea capitis resulting from an intense immune response to the infection. Kerion is characterized by the development of an inflammatory plaque with pustules, thick crusting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drainage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86627\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86627 \">picture 2</a>).<strong> </strong>A suppurative folliculitis may be the initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Tenderness or pain is often present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Kerions appear most commonly in children ages 5 to 10 and are rare in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Kerion is most often caused by a zoophilic dermatophyte; however, anthropophilic fungi can also cause a kerion. Persistent kerion can lead to scarring alopecia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Favus</strong> &ndash; Favus is a unique clinical presentation of tinea capitis resulting from infection with <em>T. schoenleinii</em> (and rarely other dermatophytes). In favus, perifollicular erythema progresses to the characteristic development of cup-shaped yellow crusts called scutula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101861\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101861 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The scutula contain fungi, neutrophils, dried serum, and epidermal cells. Scutula eventually coalesce to form adherent masses above areas of severe alopecia. There may be an associated unpleasant odor. The intense inflammation can result in permanent scarring. If untreated, favus may persist indefinitely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1140644322\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with tinea capitis may exhibit associated clinical findings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cervical lymphadenopathy </strong>&ndash; Palpable cervical lymphadenopathy is a frequent finding in patients with tinea capitis, particularly when clinical signs of inflammation are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101857\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101857 \">picture 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dermatophytid reactions </strong>&ndash; Autoeczematization reactions (id reactions) are secondary dermatitic eruptions that occur in association with a localized inflammatory skin disorder. The term dermatophytid reaction is used to refer to autoeczematization reactions that occur in association with dermatophyte infections. The pathogenesis may involve an immune reaction to fungal antigens, such as a delayed-type hypersensitivity response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dermatophytid reactions often follow the onset of antifungal therapy, but may also precede treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients develop a widespread pruritic eczematous eruption characterized by erythematous, scaly papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63421 \">picture 6</a>). Involvement of the head, neck, trunk, or extremities is common. Dermatophytid reactions are managed with treatment of the underlying fungal infection as well as emollients, oral antihistamines, or topical corticosteroids as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Oral corticosteroids are reserved for severe cases.

Fungi may be difficult to identify due to the intensity of the inflammatory reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H949998259\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tinea capitis should be strongly considered in children presenting with scale and hair loss on the scalp, particularly if cervical lymphadenopathy is present. Because the diagnosis is infrequent in adults, a higher index of suspicion is often necessary to recognize tinea capitis in the adult population. Immunocompromised states or immunosuppression may predispose adults to develop tinea capitis.</p><p>Tinea capitis often can be diagnosed based upon the physical examination if there are alopecic patches with scaling or black dots consistent with tinea capitis. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or fungal culture should be performed to confirm tinea capitis if the diagnosis is in question. These tests are often particularly useful for patients with widespread scalp scaling and subtle hair loss because of the close resemblance to seborrheic dermatitis. Biopsy of the scalp typically is not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420839875\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should include a careful examination of the hair and scalp to identify signs consistent with tinea capitis or suggestive of another disorder. Visualization of the characteristic &quot;black dots&quot; that can occur in endothrix tinea capitis or the classic scutula of favus are helpful signs that strongly suggest a diagnosis of tinea capitis. A localized inflamed, tender, boggy plaque on the scalp is suspicious for kerion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H638362\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Examination of the rest of the skin surface is also prudent to identify skin or nail findings suggestive of another condition. For example, psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis often present with scalp disease associated with characteristic eruptions in other body areas. Cervical lymph nodes should be palpated because cervical lymphadenopathy is a common, though not ubiquitous finding in tinea capitis. (See <a href=\"#H949998265\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Examination of the affected area with a Wood's light can help identify tinea capitis in patients with some ectothrix infections and favus. Ectothrix infections secondary to <em>M. canis</em> often exhibit green-yellow fluorescence under Wood's light illumination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Wood's light illumination of favus secondary to <em>T. schoenleinii</em> reveals faint blue fluorescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1195733949\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermoscopy of the hair and scalp (also known as trichoscopy) may be a useful adjunctive measure in the diagnosis of tinea capitis. Common dermoscopic findings in tinea capitis include broken hairs, dystrophic hairs, corkscrew hairs, comma hairs, and black dots (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90587\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90587 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. The findings of a study of five children with tinea capitis suggest high magnification (x150) dermoscopy may identify additional features in tinea capitis, such as horizontal white bands in hair shafts (barcode-like hairs) and translucent, easily deformable hairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dermoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dermoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A review of 24 children with tinea capitis suggests that dermoscopic findings may vary based upon the type of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition to broken hairs and black dots, children with endothrix infections (eg, <em>T. tonsurans</em>, <em>T. soudanense</em>) exhibited comma hairs and corkscrew hairs, whereas children with ectothrix infections (eg, <em>M. canis</em>, <em>M. audouinii</em>) exhibited barcode-like hairs and zigzag hairs. Additional study is necessary to confirm these findings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420839882\"><span class=\"h2\">Potassium hydroxide preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation is a rapid method for confirming the presence of a dermatophyte infection. Several hairs within the involved areas are plucked. The proximal ends of the hairs are then examined microscopically after application of potassium hydroxide to the slide. Arthroconidia (fungal spores) are found within the hair shaft in endothrix infections and predominantly outside of the hair shaft in ectothrix infections. KOH preparations of favus demonstrate hyphae and air spaces within hair shafts. Occasionally, KOH preparations fail to identify dermatophytes in patients with tinea capitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures#H4044416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;, section on 'Potassium hydroxide preparation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420839889\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fungal cultures are performed to confirm tinea capitis when the diagnosis is uncertain. However, because culture results may not be available for several weeks, if there is high suspicion for tinea capitis based upon the physical examination, treatment is usually begun empirically. False-negative results are common when fungal cultures are taken from kerion, likely secondary to the intense inflammatory response. Cultures taken during antifungal treatment of tinea capitis also are often negative, making it difficult to confirm the accuracy of the diagnosis.</p><p>To obtain a sample for culture, a sterile toothbrush is rubbed over the affected area, or the site is swabbed with a cotton swab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Sending some hairs with the scraping may increase the yield. Infected hairs often break and thus come out most easily. Culture can also be performed from a tissue biopsy; however, this is rarely necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H949998265\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of tinea capitis primarily consists of other scalp disorders that may present with scale, pustules, or hair loss. The differential diagnosis varies according to the clinical presentation. A careful physical examination often reveals features that distinguish other diseases from tinea capitis. Identification of dermatophytes on a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or culture also distinguishes tinea capitis from other diseases.</p><p>The differential diagnoses for tinea capitis based upon the clinical findings are reviewed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Scaly patches with alopecia</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Psoriasis </strong>&ndash; Well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with coarse scale are characteristic findings of psoriasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F99443\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99443 \">picture 8</a>).

Use of antifungal shampoo by other household members may also decrease the risk for reinfection (see <a href=\"#H1384653175\" class=\"local\">'Management of close contacts'</a> below). It is also recommended that combs and hair trimming equipment be cleaned mechanically and disinfected (eg, with household bleach) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1195734171\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF SPECIAL POPULATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1384652361\"><span class=\"h2\">Kerion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral antifungal therapy is the mainstay of treatment for kerion. Treatment regimens are similar to treatment for other forms of tinea capitis.

However, it is unclear if the addition of a systemic glucocorticoid accelerates improvement or improves outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1195734178\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tinea capitis is uncommon in children under the age of one (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101271\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101271 \">picture 1D</a>).

Because of this possibility, we suggest use of an antifungal shampoo by all household members for two to four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Household members should begin to use the shampoo when the infected individual begins treatment for tinea capitis.</p><p>Children with tinea capitis should avoid sharing hair care tools and headwear (eg, helmets or hats) with other individuals. Pillowcases should not be shared. In addition, participation in sports with head-to-head contact should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Bedding and towels used by the infected individual should be washed. Furniture that is frequently in direct contact with the affected individual or pet should be washed, if possible.</p><p>Cats or dogs (especially kittens and puppies) or other animals (such as cows, guinea pigs, and other animals) may be reservoirs for infection. The animals can have clinical signs of dermatophyte infection with scaling and hair loss, but can also be asymptomatic carriers. If there is an outbreak of tinea in a family, the pet (especially if new) should be evaluated by a veterinarian. The animal should also be evaluated if the patient or other household members experience recurrent dermatophyte infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1540870637\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of tinea capitis is excellent, with complete clearance occurring in most patients after a course of treatment. Complete hair regrowth occurs in most children with hair loss. Patients with prolonged or severe infections (eg, kerion, favus) have the greatest risk for permanent alopecia. Still, the majority of lost hair often regrows.</p><p>There are rare reports of fungemia from dermatophyte infections in immunosuppressed patients. There is one report of culture-proven fungemia in an immunocompetent patient after surgical excision of a kerion due <em>T. mentagrophytes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tinea-capitis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Clinical follow-up to assess for clinical clearance should be performed at the end of therapy to assess for clinical cure. In patients who have experienced recurrent tinea capitis, we typically perform a fungal culture to confirm clearance after treatment. A fungal culture should also be performed in patients who appear to fail treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1540870631\" class=\"local\">'Treatment failure'</a> below.)</p><p>Continuation of twice-weekly antifungal shampoo may help decrease the rate of reinfection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1540870631\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs of ongoing infection include persistent erythema, scale, or drainage.

(See <a href=\"#H420839889\" class=\"local\">'Culture'</a> above.)</p><p>If there is a poor response to treatment, adherence to the treatment regimen should be assessed. This includes review of the actual frequency of treatment and dose ingested, as well the method of drug administration. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=griseofulvin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Griseofulvin</a> is much more effectively absorbed when given with fatty foods, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> absorption is reduced when crushed or sprinkled into apple sauce or fruits. If the child has been unable to take the medication as prescribed, methods to improve adherence (eg, education or change in medication formulation) should be made to increase the likelihood of adequate treatment.</p><p>For patients initially treated with 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=griseofulvin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">griseofulvin</a> per day and with good adherence to therapy, an inadequate response can be managed with an increase in dose to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day and extension of the treatment course to a total of 12 weeks. Alternatively, the patient can be switched to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a>. Increasing the dose and duration of griseofulvin is our preferred intervention for patients with <em>M. canis</em> infection. Occasionally, treatment for longer than 12 weeks is needed. If a patient has a poor response to initial treatment with terbinafine, then griseofulvin should be used, especially if the infection is with <em>Microsporum</em> species.</p><p>In addition to adherence to therapy, the possibility of reinfection from contact with an infected individual or pet, contaminated fomites, or an asymptomatic carrier of the dermatophyte should be considered when patients fail treatment.

Dermatophytes in the genera <em>Trichophyton</em> and <em>Microsporum</em> are responsible for almost all cases of tinea capitis. (See <a href=\"#H949998167\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H420839731\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermatophyte infection of the hair may present in three forms: endothrix infection, ectothrix infection, or favus. In endothrix infection, arthroconidia (fungal spores) are present within the hair shaft. Arthroconidia in ectothrix infections primarily surround the hair shaft. Favus is characterized by hyphae and air spaces within the hair shaft. (See <a href=\"#H420839737\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tinea capitis has multiple clinical presentations. The most common manifestations are scaly patches with alopecia and patches of alopecia with black dots at follicular orifices that represent broken hairs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86686%7EDERM%2F101630%7EDERM%2F101858%7EDERM%2F101271%7EDERM%2F101859%7EDERM%2F86628\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86686 graphicRef101630 graphicRef101858 graphicRef101271 graphicRef101859 graphicRef86628 \">picture 1A-F</a>). Other manifestations include widespread scaling on the scalp with subtle hair loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101860\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101860 \">picture 4</a>), kerion (an inflammatory, boggy plaque (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86627\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86627 \">picture 2</a>)), and favus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F101861\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101861 \">picture 3</a>). Scutula (cup-shaped yellow crusts) are a characteristic finding in favus. (See <a href=\"#H949998211\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical lymphadenopathy is common in patients with tinea capitis. Secondary dermatitic eruptions (dermatophytid reactions) may also occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F63421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63421 \">picture 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1140644322\" class=\"local\">'Associated findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of tinea capitis may be made based upon clinical findings. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or fungal culture should be performed to confirm tinea capitis if the diagnosis is in question. Examination with a Wood's lamp and dermoscopy may be helpful for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H949998259\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral antifungal therapy is the mainstay of antifungal therapy.

For patients with tinea capitis that is known or considered very likely to be secondary to <em>Microsporum</em> species, we recommend treatment with oral griseofulvin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).
