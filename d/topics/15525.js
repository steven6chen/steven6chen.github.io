Cigarette smoking became highly prevalent in most developed countries through the 20<sup>th</sup> century; with a lag of several decades, the rise of smoking was followed by epidemic increases in smoking-related diseases, including lung and other cancers, heart disease, and chronic lung disease. Despite mounting epidemiologic evidence and authoritative syntheses in the reports of the United States Surgeon General, smoking and smoking-related diseases are still major public health concerns. There has been some success with tobacco control in developed countries; however, tobacco smoking is on the rise in developing countries.</p><p>The issue of exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) and health has a much briefer history, although the irritating nature of tobacco smoke to the nonsmoker has long been chronicled. Some of the first epidemiological studies on SHS exposure and health were reported in the late 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Initial investigations focused upon parental smoking and lower respiratory illnesses in infants; studies of lung function and respiratory symptoms in children soon followed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The first major studies on SHS and lung cancer in nonsmokers were reported in 1981 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], and by 1986, the evidence supported the conclusion that SHS was a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers, a conclusion reached by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the United States Surgeon General, and the United States National Research Council [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/4,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9</a>].</p><p>A substantial body of evidence has continued to identify new diseases and other adverse effects, including increased risk for coronary heart disease and stroke associated with SHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The comprehensive review in the 2014 report of the Surgeon General, <a href=\"http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/50-years-of-progress/index.html#execsumm&amp;token=kPHJc6kIK6pV5oOmm3nk1vd31F051fQhbNoXOg1tiXnO8tR+LTOaAeU1PV36VDoFSF9Bsjhz8zwC0kTIbHPlZrGUSc8XUSYMgLjx+spSSj+649tek2UboErv5ZWzMJNV&amp;TOPIC_ID=6375\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The Health Consequences of Smoking&mdash;50 Years of Progress</a> leaves no doubt that involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke is harmful to nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The findings on SHS and disease have been the foundation of the drive for smoke-free indoor environments and for educating parents concerning the effects of their smoking on their children's health.</p><p>The effects of SHS on the health of children will be reviewed here. The health effects of SHS in adults and approaches to limit exposure to SHS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-secondhand-smoke-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of secondhand smoke exposure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS SECONDHAND SMOKE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondhand smoke (SHS) is one of several terms used for the involuntary exposure of nonsmokers to tobacco smoke from the smoking of others. The smoke inhaled by nonsmokers has also been referred to as environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), but this term has fallen out of use. More than one billion adults worldwide are smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], implying that some SHS exposure is almost unavoidable for children and for the two-thirds of adults who do not smoke.</p><p>SHS is a mixture of sidestream smoke given off by the smoldering cigarette (or pipe or cigar) and of mainstream smoke that is exhaled back into the air by active smokers. Sidestream smoke, generated under the lower temperature conditions in the smoldering cigarette, has higher concentrations of many of the toxic compounds found in mainstream smoke, including nicotine and carbon monoxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, it is quickly diluted as it moves away from the cigarette to contaminate the immediate environment.</p><p>The term &quot;thirdhand smoke&quot; (THS) has been used to refer to smoke components deposited on surfaces, along with metabolites of these components generated through oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Laboratory research has documented that carcinogens may be formed. These toxins may be absorbed through the skin, by ingestion, or inhalation of resuspended dust, but the potential health effects are not yet well studied. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-secondhand-smoke-exposure#H22504300\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of secondhand smoke exposure&quot;, section on 'Thirdhand smoke exposure'</a>.) </p><p>Exposure to SHS can be estimated by measuring concentrations of smoke components in the air, such as small particles or nicotine, or in the exposed subject with biomarkers including cotinine, nicotine, and tobacco-specific carcinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Cotinine is a primary metabolite of nicotine and is specific for exposure to tobacco smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Cotinine can be measured in blood, urine, saliva, and other tissues. Hair nicotine level has proved to be a useful biomarker in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Blood samples provide the best quantitative measure of SHS exposure and reflect nicotine exposure from SHS and THS over approximately three days preceding the test. However, the clinical use of cotinine levels to provide feedback to parents is limited by lack of a rapid commercially available assay and substantial within-subject variability. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF SECONDHAND SMOKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite quantitative differences between secondhand smoke (SHS) and the mainstream smoke inhaled by the active smoker, sufficient qualitative similarity exists to warrant concern that the health of nonsmokers may be injured by SHS, just as active smokers are harmed by mainstream smoke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There is now ample scientific evidence to justify these concerns about adverse health effects in nonsmokers. Indeed, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that exposure to SHS is responsible for more than 0.9 million premature deaths worldwide in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a separate analysis for 2004, twenty-eight percent of the mortality and 61 percent of the morbidity from SHS was seen in children, mostly due to lower respiratory infections and asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory symptoms and illness'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects in childhood</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence of the health risks of SHS comes from epidemiological studies, which have directly assessed the associations of measures of SHS exposure with disease outcomes, and also from animal studies and in vitro testing. Judgments about the causality of associations between SHS exposure and health outcomes are based not only upon this epidemiological evidence, but also upon the extensive evidence derived from epidemiological and toxicological investigation of the health consequences of active smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation#H2589684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;, section on 'Benefits of smoking cessation'</a>.)</p><p>The literature on SHS and health has been reviewed periodically for several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/4,9,22-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,22-28</a>], and the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary Report of the Surgeon General, published in 2014, provides an important comprehensive review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Causal conclusions were reached as early as 1986, when involuntary smoking was found to be a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers by the International Agency for Research on Cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], the United States Surgeon General [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and the United States National Research Council [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Each of these reports interpreted the available epidemiological evidence in the context of the wider understanding of active smoking and lung cancer. In spite of somewhat differing approaches for reaching a conclusion, the findings of the three reports were identical: involuntary smoking is a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. In 1992, the EPA concluded that SHS is a group A carcinogen (sufficient evidence exists from epidemiologic studies to support a causal association between the substance in question and cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a>). Cardiac and cerebrovascular disease also has been causally associated with SHS exposure in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evidence of adverse respiratory effects of SHS exposure for children was included in the 1986 reports of the United States Surgeon General and the National Research Council [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. Subsequent public health reports from the United States and elsewhere have identified additional health risks associated with SHS exposure in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/10,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,22-24</a>]. These reports describe the following specific risks for children, each of which is discussed in detail below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality of life and costs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prematurity and perinatal mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal growth and development</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory symptoms and illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lower respiratory illnesses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic respiratory symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Asthma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduced lung function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atherogenesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Middle ear disease</p><p/><p>In addition, there is suggestive but not definitive evidence for an association between SHS exposure and dental caries, renal function, and childhood cancers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Quality of life and costs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The morbidity associated with SHS exposure is a significant public health issue for children that affects both quality of life and healthcare costs. As an example, the 1991 United States National Health Interview Survey (including 17,448 children) found that children who were exposed to SHS had, on average, two more days of restricted activity, one more day of bed confinement, and 1.4 more days of school absence than did those who were not exposed, even after controlling for age, socioeconomic status, race, sex, and family size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Analysis of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (including 5400 United States children aged 4 to 16 years) showed an association between high cotinine levels and wheezing, increased school absence, and reduced lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These results come from an era where SHS exposures in the United States were generally much higher than at present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Prematurity and perinatal mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The level of tobacco exposure of the fetus of a mother who smokes is the same as the level for an active smoker. Maternal smoking is associated with increased perinatal mortality (stillbirths and neonatal deaths). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette and tobacco products in pregnancy: Impact on pregnancy and the neonate&quot;, section on 'Adverse outcomes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Fetal growth and development</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal smoking during pregnancy &ndash; Active smoking by pregnant women, resulting in passive smoking for the developing fetus, increases risk for a variety of adverse health effects in children; these effects are hypothesized to result primarily from transplacental exposure of the fetus to tobacco smoke components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In particular, maternal smoking during pregnancy reduces birth weight by about 200 g on average [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/24,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,33,34</a>]. A systematic review of studies published from 1959 through 2010 found that maternal active smoking was associated with increased risk of several nonchromosomal birth defects, including modest effects (odds ratios [ORs] 1.09 to 1.19) on <span class=\"nowrap\">cardiovascular/heart</span> defects, musculoskeletal defects, and cryptorchidism, and slightly larger effects (ORs 1.25 to 1.50) on limb reduction defects, clubfoot, craniosynostosis, orofacial clefts, eye anomalies, and gastrointestinal defects (including gastroschisis and abdominal hernias) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83134 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].The 2014 Report of the Surgeon General concluded that the association of orofacial clefts with maternal smoking is causal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette and tobacco products in pregnancy: Impact on pregnancy and the neonate&quot;, section on 'Adverse outcomes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-of-mothers-with-substance-use-disorder#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants of mothers with substance use disorder&quot;, section on 'Cigarette smoking'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adverse effects of in utero or postnatal exposure to SHS on neuropsychological development also have been postulated. Numerous components of SHS, including nicotine and carbon monoxide, may produce these effects. The association between maternal smoking and cognitive development is not clear. A 2015 review of 29 studies showed that most found cognitive deficits among children whose mothers smoked during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Another review found associations of maternal smoking during pregnancy with brain structural changes in the offspring, as detected by imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, the sizes of the effects were small, and the long-term consequences remain unclear. Accordingly, the 2014 Report of the Surgeon General concluded that nicotine exposure during fetal development has &quot;lasting adverse consequences for brain development&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <br/><br/>Other studies report adverse effects of SHS exposure on neurodevelopmental outcomes without distinguishing between maternal smoking pregnancy and postnatal exposure of the child to SHS. As an example, one study reported negative associations between serum cotinine concentrations (used as an index of SHS exposure) and measures of motor function in school-aged children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal exposure to SHS during pregnancy &ndash; Exposure of nonsmoking mothers to SHS is associated with reduced birth weight, although the extent of the reduction is far less than that for active maternal smoking during pregnancy. In a meta-analysis, the summary estimate of the reduction of birth weight associated with paternal smoking was 28 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A randomized trial showed that a counseling intervention to reduce SHS exposure in a group of pregnant women markedly reduced rates of very low birthweight and very preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Of note, 26 percent of the women in the intervention group reporting only SHS exposure had cotinine levels consistent with active smoking (salivary cotinine levels &ge;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> suggesting that active smoking was underreported by this group of pregnant women. Nonetheless, the counseling intervention was effective in reducing SHS exposure and improving pregnancy outcomes regardless of baseline cotinine levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other perinatal health effects possibly associated with exposure of a nonsmoking woman to SHS during pregnancy are growth retardation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>], stillbirth, and congenital malformations in the offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The few studies conducted to assess the association between paternal smoking and congenital malformations have demonstrated risks ranging from 1.2 to 2.6 for exposed compared with nonexposed children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. One study suggests that maternal exposure to SHS during pregnancy is associated with modest impairment in gross motor function in her offspring, measured at 18 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Sudden infant death syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) refers to the unexpected death of a seemingly healthy infant while asleep. Maternal smoking during pregnancy has been causally associated with SIDS. An estimated 25 to 40 percent of SIDS cases are related to smoking during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The relationship between smoking during pregnancy and SIDS was studied prospectively in 24,986 Danish infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Compared with the children of nonsmokers, the children of smokers had more than three times the risk of SIDS; the risk of SIDS increased with the number of cigarettes smoked per day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden infant death syndrome: Risk factors and risk reduction strategies&quot;, section on 'Maternal risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>It is important to determine whether maternal smoking after pregnancy, or paternal smoking and household smoking generally, are also causally associated with SIDS. Isolating the effects of prenatal smoking is difficult because most women who smoke during pregnancy continue to smoke after delivery, and initial reports failed to establish a causal association between postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke and SIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, more recent reports conclude that there is a causal association between exposure to SHS and SIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In addition, an ecological analysis found that for every 1 percent increase in the state-level prevalence of smoke-free homes with infants, the SIDS rates for the states decreased by 0.4 percent, while controlling for supine sleep position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. These data suggest that the increase in smoke-free homes has contributed to the observed decline in SIDS deaths between 1995 and 2006. The 2006 Surgeon General's report goes on to state that tobacco smoke exposure is one of the major preventable risk factors for SIDS, and that all measures should be taken to protect infants from SHS exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Respiratory symptoms and illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous surveys demonstrate a greater frequency of the most common respiratory symptoms, cough, phlegm, and wheeze, in the children of smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/4,10,22,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,22,51</a>]. A meta-analysis of relevant studies reported pooled odds ratios for either parent smoking ranging from 1.23 and 1.5 for asthma, wheeze, cough, increased phlegm, or breathlessness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The highest risks for these symptoms occurred in children with two parents who smoked (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50141\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50141 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Participants in these studies generally have been school-aged children. The less prominent effects of SHS in comparison with the studies of lower respiratory illness in infants may reflect lower exposures to SHS by older children who spend less time with their parents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32470158\"><span class=\"h4\">Lower respiratory tract illnesses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with parents who smoke have an increased risk of lower respiratory tract illness, including a significantly increased frequency of bronchitis and pneumonia during the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/32,52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,52-56</a>]. Presumably, this association represents an increase in frequency or severity of illnesses that are infectious in etiology, perhaps related to increased nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal colonization with respiratory pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], and not a direct response of the lung to the toxic components of SHS. Effects of exposure in utero on the airways also may play a role in the effect of postnatal exposure on risk for lower respiratory illnesses.</p><p>The approximate increase in risk for lower respiratory illness is 50 percent if either parent smokes, with a somewhat greater increase for maternal smoking specifically (odds ratio [OR] 1.70, 95% CI 1.56-1.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although measures of health outcome have varied somewhat among the various studies, the relative risks associated with involuntary smoking were similar, and dose-response relationships with the extent of parental smoking were demonstrable.</p><p>Most studies have shown that maternal smoking rather than paternal smoking contributes the predominant component of the increased risk associated with parental smoking. Nonetheless, studies from China and Vietnam, where women rarely smoke, show that paternal smoking alone can increase the incidence of lower respiratory illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/55,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,58,59</a>]. In most studies, the effect of SHS is noted during the first year of life; this finding may be explained by higher exposures during the first year because of the time-activity patterns of young infants, which place them in close proximity to cigarettes smoked by their mothers.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'What is secondhand smoke?'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In managing a pregnancy, an assessment of smoking by the mother, the father, and other adults in the home should be routine. Most women stop smoking while pregnant, but a substantial percentage of smoking women (up to about 30 percent) continue to smoke. To encourage smoking cessation, the clinician should advise pregnant women who smoke about the adverse effects of their smoking for the fetus, including effects on growth and development, and risks of prematurity and delivery complications such as abruptio placenta (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Prematurity and perinatal mortality'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette and tobacco products in pregnancy: Impact on pregnancy and the neonate&quot;, section on 'Adverse outcomes'</a>). In addition, pregnant women should be advised about the continued adverse effects of their smoking after birth, including risks of sudden infant death syndrome, asthma and lower respiratory tract illnesses, and middle ear disease, as detailed above. Support and referral to resources for cessation should be offered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Children at risk for asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to tobacco smoke should be avoided for all children, but particularly for the child at risk for asthma on the basis of a family history of asthma and allergies, beginning with in-utero exposure. During the first weeks after birth, studies of lung function of infants whose mothers smoke have demonstrated increased airways responsiveness, perhaps a precursor of asthma. SHS exposure, particularly from maternal smoking, is a known risk factor for asthma in young children. Given that genetic predisposition may require environmental triggering to manifest, preventable triggers such as SHS exposure should be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Children with asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SHS exposure, particularly from parental smoking, is associated with increased symptoms, medication usage, and utilization of health services for asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Guidelines for the management of asthma, for example those developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], call for the elimination of SHS exposure in the home for children with asthma. Intervention studies demonstrated reduced morbidity and decreased airway hyperresponsiveness with reduced parental smoking exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/116,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">116,117</a>]. Parents may not recognize tobacco smoke as a trigger if the child does not have immediate symptoms and may not report it as such. A useful intervention may be to point out the role of SHS as an irritant to the airways that can accentuate airway hyperresponsiveness, leaving them more vulnerable to the effects of other triggers. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory symptoms and illness'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking restrictions in the home and vehicles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reducing SHS exposure in the home and vehicles is critical since the home is the major location of exposure for children and for nonsmoking adults who are not exposed elsewhere. For this purpose, policies banning or restricting smoking in the home should be recommended for families with smokers. The only approach that effectively protects nonsmokers is to make the home smoke free [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/10,32,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,32,118</a>]. Other restrictions, such as creating designated smoke-free areas, restricting smoking to outside the home, and smoking only when no children are present, are far less effective. SHS cannot be controlled by either air cleaning or building ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children/abstract/26,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,119</a>].

Exposure to SHS can be estimated by measuring concentrations of smoke components in the air, or in the form of biomarkers such as cotinine. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'What is secondhand smoke?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is good evidence that exposure to SHS is causally associated with a number of adverse health effects in children, including prematurity and perinatal mortality, fetal growth restriction, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and respiratory symptoms and illnesses including asthma, atherogenesis and future risk of cardiovascular disease, renal function impairment, and middle ear disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Health consequences of secondhand smoke'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SHS exposure during adulthood also has adverse health effects; these issues are discussed in a separate topic review.

Exposure of a nonsmoking pregnant woman to SHS is also associated with reduced birth weight, although the extent of the reduction is far less than that for active maternal smoking during pregnancy.
