Briefly:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>History: Patients should be asked about easy bruisability, jaundice, dark urine, light stools, history of gastrointestinal bleeding (eg, hematemesis or melena), signs associated with hypogonadism (eg, impotence, infertility), and pruritus.

Decompensated liver disease is likely if ascites <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> encephalopathy are present.

A low albumin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> and elevated prothrombin time are suggestive of advanced liver disease with hepatic decompensation. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia may heighten suspicion of portal hypertension. Although certain findings are suggestive of advanced liver disease, they may also be a result of HIV infection.

Increasing data support the use of noninvasive methods rather than liver biopsy to evaluate liver stage. As an example, a meta-analysis of 2772 Asian patients with chronic HBV found that the sensitivity and specificity of transient elastography for cirrhosis was 84.6 and 81.5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As a result, liver biopsy is performed less frequently than in the past. However, a biopsy can help determine the true degree of hepatic fibrosis when laboratory evaluations suggest the presence of portal hypertension and noninvasive markers indicate mild liver disease.
