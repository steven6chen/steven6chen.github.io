It can result from inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, PTH resistance, vitamin D deficiency or resistance, abnormal magnesium metabolism, and extravascular deposition of calcium, which can occur in several clinical situations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic approach to hypocalcemia involves confirming, by repeat measurement, the presence of hypocalcemia and distinguishing among the potential etiologies. The diagnosis may be obvious from the patient's history; examples include chronic kidney disease and postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. When the cause is not obvious or a suspected cause needs to be confirmed, other biochemical tests are indicated.</p><p>This topic will review the evaluation of patients with hypocalcemia. The clinical manifestations and treatment of hypocalcemia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONFIRM HYPOCALCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the evaluation of a patient with hypocalcemia is to verify with repeat measurement (total serum calcium corrected for albumin or ionized calcium) that there is a true decrease in the serum calcium concentration. If available, previous values for serum calcium should also be reviewed. If the patient has a low albumin-corrected serum calcium or ionized calcium concentration, further evaluation to identify the cause is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Determining the etiology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2618010259\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoalbuminemia: Calcium correction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium in serum is bound to proteins, principally albumin. As a result, the total serum calcium concentration in patients with low or high serum albumin levels may not accurately reflect the physiologically important ionized (or free) calcium concentration. Each 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> reduction in the serum albumin concentration will lower the total calcium concentration by approximately 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> without affecting the ionized calcium concentration and, therefore, without producing any symptoms or signs of hypocalcemia.</p><p>Therefore, a patient who has a serum albumin concentration that is 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> below normal will have a fall in serum total calcium concentration of 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. If the measured serum total calcium concentration is 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> then the corrected value will be 9.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> which is normal. Thus, in patients with hypoalbuminemia or hyperalbuminemia, the measured serum calcium concentration should be corrected for the abnormality in serum albumin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or for standard units (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3854978778\"><span class=\"h2\">Ionized calcium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the diagnosis of hypocalcemia is in doubt, either because the patient's symptoms are atypical or the patient's serum calcium concentration is only slightly low, serum ionized calcium should be measured if a laboratory known to measure ionized calcium reliably is available. It is important to note that the affinity of calcium for albumin is increased in the presence of alkalosis. Thus, respiratory alkalosis may cause an acute decrease in ionized calcium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING THE ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypocalcemia has many causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62899\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62899 \">table 1</a>).

A family history of hypocalcemia suggests a genetic cause. Chronic hypocalcemia is often seen in patients with an activating mutation of the calcium-sensing receptor and in pseudohypoparathyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of the calcium-sensing receptor: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, acquired hypoparathyroidism is most often the result of postsurgical or autoimmune damage to the parathyroid glands. Postsurgical hypoparathyroidism can occur after thyroid, parathyroid, or radical neck surgery for head and neck cancer. Thus, a history of head and neck surgery or the presence of a neck scar suggests postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoparathyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoparathyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Autoimmune hypoparathyroidism can occur as an isolated abnormality and is also a common feature of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type I, which is a familial disorder. The presence of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and adrenal insufficiency suggests a polyglandular syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-adrenal-insufficiency-addisons-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease)&quot;, section on 'Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type 1'</a>.)</p><p>There are several drugs that also may cause hypocalcemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62899\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62899 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Other causes of hypocalcemia that may be apparent from the history, physical examination, and routine laboratory data include acute or chronic kidney disease, acute pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, and marked increases in tissue breakdown with the release of phosphate from cells, as occurs in the tumor lysis syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62899\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62899 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The physical examination may reveal findings of latent tetany, such as Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs, which are strongly suggestive of hypocalcemia.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Serum PTH concentrations'</a> below.)</p><p>Other measurements that may be helpful include serum magnesium, creatinine, phosphate, the vitamin D metabolites calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]) and calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active vitamin D hormone), alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and urinary calcium and magnesium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-hypocalcemia/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

Hypocalcemia is the most potent stimulus of PTH secretion; as a result, a low or even normal serum PTH concentration in a patient with hypocalcemia is strong evidence of hypoparathyroidism.

Hypocalcemia should resolve within minutes or hours after restoration of normal serum magnesium concentrations if hypomagnesemia was the cause of the hypocalcemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypocalcemia#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypocalcemia&quot;, section on 'Concurrent hypomagnesemia'</a>.)</p><p>A few patients with magnesium-responsive hypocalcemia have <strong>normal</strong> serum magnesium concentrations.

The elevated serum phosphate concentration in patients with either disorder is due to loss of the stimulatory effect of PTH on urinary phosphate excretion and is therefore associated with an inappropriately low fractional excretion of phosphate.

Vitamin D deficiency also diminishes intestinal phosphate absorption. Excess PTH enhances phosphate excretion and lowers the serum phosphate.</p><p>Measurement of serum 25(OH)D (calcidiol) provides more information about vitamin D deficiency than does measurement of serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) because the hypocalcemia-induced increase in PTH secretion stimulates renal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production (in patients without underlying renal insufficiency). Thus, in individuals with vitamin D deficiency, serum 25(OH)D is low whereas 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is typically normal or high. In contrast, patients with hypoparathyroidism may have normal serum 25(OH)D and low 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72080 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The various causes of vitamin D deficiency usually can be distinguished by the history and other clinical findings (deficient dietary intake, inadequate sunlight exposure, malabsorption, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> therapy) and by measurement of 25(OH)D (calcidiol).
