The flexor tendon catches when it attempts to glide through a relatively stenotic sheath, resulting in an inability to smoothly flex or extend the finger. In severe cases, the finger may become locked in flexion or extension, requiring passive manipulation of the finger to achieve normal motion. The cause of trigger finger is most frequently unclear, although patients often attribute it to overuse or repetitive movements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal complications in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Flexor tenosynovitis'</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of trigger finger are discussed here. The anatomy of the finger flexion and pulley system is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finger-and-thumb-anatomy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Finger and thumb anatomy&quot;, section on 'Finger flexion and pulley system'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376419197\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trigger finger is one of the most common causes of hand pain in adults. The reported prevalence is roughly 2 percent in the general population, and is more common among women than men in the fifth or sixth decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It can occur in one or many fingers in each hand and can be bilateral. The prevalence of trigger finger is also higher among patients with diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, or conditions that cause systemic deposition of protein such as amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Trigger finger is occasionally observed in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucopolysaccharidoses-complications#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucopolysaccharidoses: Complications&quot;, section on 'Carpal tunnel syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376419281\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOPATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of trigger fingers are idiopathic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Symptoms usually begin spontaneously, without a prior history of trauma or change in activity level. There are some observational reports suggesting an association with occupational or repetitive activities, but this is somewhat controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The main histopathological change is fibrocartilaginous metaplasia of the ligamentous layer of the tendon sheath at the first annular (A1) pulley with secondary reduction in the cross-sectional area of the fibro-osseous canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Functional impairment in finger flexion and extension is primarily a result of mechanical impingement leading to tendon entrapment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with trigger finger initially describe painless snapping, catching, or locking of one or more fingers during flexion of the affected digit. This often progresses to painful episodes in which the patient has difficulty spontaneously extending the affected digits. The pain is localized over the volar aspect of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and radiates into the palm or the distal finger. The patient may rub over the tendon in the palm or demonstrate the locking phenomenon when describing the condition. Some patients awaken with the finger locked in the palm, with gradual &quot;unlocking&quot; as the day progresses.</p><p>In more severe cases, the finger may become locked in flexion requiring passive manipulation of the finger into extension, which can be painful. Reluctance to fully flex and extend the digit because of pain or locking can eventually lead to secondary contracture at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. It is also not unusual for a patient to have multiple trigger digits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of trigger finger is primarily based upon a history of locking or clicking during finger movement, which can be demonstrated on physical examination when the patient is asked to fully open and close the hand. The hands are placed in the palms-up position and the patient is asked to actively flex and extend the fingers, and to try to make the finger lock or catch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63023 \">picture 1</a>). Alternatively, if active triggering is not present, the examiner places his fingers on the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) as the finger is actively flexed and extended, noting the presence of loss of smooth motion or a clicking sensation. The locking does not have to occur with every repetition.</p><p>Additional findings may include pain or tenderness at the base of the finger, directly over the tendon as it courses over the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. A tender nodule (thickening of the tendons) may also be present. Pain may be aggravated by stretching the tendon in extension or by resisting flexion isometrically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55130\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55130 \">picture 2</a>). In addition to the nodule or swelling of the tendon, patients may also have palmar fascial thickening overlying the tendon sheath associated with a concurrent Dupuytren&rsquo;s contracture.</p><p>A local anesthetic block is rarely necessary to make the diagnosis of trigger finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F98722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98722 \">picture 3</a>). It is occasionally used in patients with tenosynovitis complicating an early presentation of Dupuytren's contracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupuytrens-contracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dupuytren's contracture&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiographs are not necessary in diagnosing patient with suspected trigger finger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of trigger finger includes other conditions that can lead to locking, pain, loss of motion, and swelling of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, several of which are presented below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1483259337\"><span class=\"h2\">Dupuytren&rsquo;s contracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dupuytren&rsquo;s contracture is characterized by loss of full extension of the affected finger or fingers at the MCP joint. The loss of extension is fixed and chronic, while in a trigger finger it is dynamic and episodic. Unlike trigger finger, Dupuytren&rsquo;s is painless and nodular lesions are typically evident in the palmar fascia. The nodule typically progresses over a period of time to form a fibrous cord that extends from the palm to the digits, which also helps distinguish it from trigger finger. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupuytrens-contracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dupuytren's contracture&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1483259343\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetic cheiroarthropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic cheiroarthropathy is characterized by a typically painless, limited ability to fully extend the MCP joints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interphalangeal joints. It generally affects all fingers, whereas trigger finger may affect one or more fingers. It may progress to fixed flexion contractures of the finger joints. A tight, waxy skin surface over the dorsum of the hand is usually observed, which is not observed in trigger finger. However, patients who have diabetic cheiroarthropathy and limited joint mobility are more likely to also develop trigger finger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=limited-joint-mobility-in-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Limited joint mobility in diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1483259349\"><span class=\"h2\">Metacarpophalangeal joint sprain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tenderness on either side of the MCP joint associated with loss of full flexion suggests a sprain of the MCP joint, particularly in the setting of recent trauma. Thus, a history of trauma and the absence of triggering can help distinguish this from trigger finger.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1483259355\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection within the tendon sheath</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe pain and tenderness of the flexor tendon in the hand, particularly in the setting of a preceding puncture or bite wound involving the finger or hand suggests infectious tenosynovitis. It is imperative to recognize this syndrome, since a closed-space infection can lead to severe limitation of motion due to tendon disruption. It can be distinguished from trigger finger as it often leads to more severe pain, tenderness, erythema, and swelling in long axis over the affected tendon or finger. Infection of the hand requires immediate surgical consultation for possible exploration and drainage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and initial management of animal and human bites&quot;, section on 'Infected wound'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=soft-tissue-infections-due-to-human-bites#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Soft tissue infections due to human bites&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1483259361\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcific peritendinitis or periarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcific peritendinitis or periarthritis is an inflammatory process associated with juxtaarticular deposits of calcium hydroxyapatite, and has been described in the vicinity of almost every joint in the hand and wrist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients may present with significant pain and erythema so severe that it simulates infection, which is not usually seen with trigger finger. Locking or triggering of the finger is also not observed with calcific peritendinitis or periarthritis. Radiographs may demonstrate fluffy calcification in the area of inflammation, but this is not usually apparent until a few days after the onset of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1483257496\"><span class=\"h2\">Tenosynovitis (non-infectious)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain, tenderness, and swelling along the flexor tendon in the hand may be associated with an underlying inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis or reactive arthritis. It can be differentiated from trigger finger in that tenosynovitis often leads to swelling and pain along the long axis of the affected tendon, joints, or finger, resulting in limited or painful extension of the involved digit. Tenosynovitis improves with treatment of the underlying arthritis with medications such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and systemic glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Hands'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;, section on 'Musculoskeletal signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treatment of trigger finger are to alleviate pain and to allow smoother movement of the finger with flexion and extension. A variety of therapeutic options ranging from conservative to more invasive are presented below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1317164213\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our overall approach to therapy is usually to start with conservative interventions which include activity modification, splinting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> short-term nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A local glucocorticoid injection may be offered to patients whose symptoms have not resolved with conservative management.</p><p>Patients who present with severe symptoms or frequent episodes of triggering may benefit from a glucocorticoid injection at the initial presentation. Surgical release is generally reserved for patients who have failed conservative therapy and have not improved with one or two glucocorticoid injections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest initial management with either activity modification or splinting. Patients may continue with normal activity but avoid potentially aggravating movements such as pinching or grasping of the fingers. Several small observational studies have also shown that immobilization of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint with splinting with a metal finger splint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F101355\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101355 \">picture 4</a>) or a custom made thermoplastic splint can also help alleviate pain and reduce triggering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. As an example, a study including 28 patients with trigger finger treated with a custom thermoplastic splint found statistically significant improvements across a variety of outcome measures, including the number of triggering events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, approximately 93 percent of patients felt that their triggering had improved after 6 to 10 weeks of splint wear, and 54 percent of patients felt that their symptoms had completely resolved.</p><p>The splint should keep the MCP joint in slight flexion and can be worn based on trigger pattern and patient preferences (eg, daytime use, nighttime use, or use with activity). The suggested duration of splinting is generally three to six weeks. For milder cases, primary care clinicians may suggest taping the affected finger with the adjacent normal fingers (buddy taping) to limit flexion of the finger.</p><p>We also suggest a concurrent trial of NSAIDs for pain relief, unless contraindicated by gastrointestinal, renal, or heart disease. NSAIDs should be taken for a maximum duration of two to four weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H3693478\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients whose symptoms do not improve with activity modification, splinting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> judicious use of NSAIDs, additional therapeutic options include glucocorticoid injections and surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376420295\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoid injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A local glucocorticoid injection is suggested for patients whose symptoms have not resolved after four to six weeks of conservative therapy (eg, splinting) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F98722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98722 \">picture 3</a>). We use an intermediate-acting glucocorticoid for injection such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> mixed with a local anesthetic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>. As mentioned above, a glucocorticoid injection may be offered sooner to patients who present with severe locking and incomplete finger flexion or extension. The injection may be repeated in six weeks if symptoms have not improved by at least 50 percent. In clinical practice, the maximum number of injections does not exceed three. However, the vast majority of patients experience significant improvement with a single injection. Persistent relief beyond 12 months is expected in approximately 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Glucocorticoid injections for trigger finger in patients with diabetes are generally less successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of glucocorticoid injections for trigger finger in adults has been demonstrated in numerous observational studies, with relatively lasting effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>]. As an example, a study including 366 patients with trigger finger found that at least 45 percent of patients experienced relief lasting up to 10 years after a single glucocorticoid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, a systematic review including two randomized trials of poor methodological quality found that glucocorticoid injection was more effective for symptom relief than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> injection alone after four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Another trial randomly assigned 50 patients with trigger finger to receive either local glucocorticoid or placebo injection and found that patients who received a glucocorticoid injection had a significantly greater improvement in pain and reduction in triggering, which persisted during the 12-month follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Pediatric patients with trigger thumb represent a special circumstance. Injections are not recommended in this population. Splinting and observation leads to resolution in slightly more than 60 percent of children. Surgery is an alternative when the deformity persists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Adverse effects from glucocorticoid injections for trigger finger are rare, but include atrophy of the subcutaneous fat and hypopigmentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is suggested when pain and locking persist despite conservative therapy and at least one or two local glucocorticoid injections. Ultrasound-guided percutaneous and open surgical release of the first annular (A1) pulley ligament are both effective, with a recurrence rate of only about 3 percent, but controversy exists as to whether they are equally effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. As an example, a large meta-analysis including seven randomized trials compared percutaneous release, open surgery, or glucocorticoid injections in patients with trigger finger, and found no differences in the failure rate and complication frequency between the two different surgical approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, patients treated with percutaneous releases were less likely to have treatment failure compared with patients treated with glucocorticoid injections.</p><p>Complications from surgery include infection, digital nerve injury, flexor tendon bowstringing (or protrusion of the flexor tendon into the palm with finger flexion), and tendon scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Postoperatively, patients are able to resume many activities of daily living, such as dressing, eating, and doing sedentary work, within a few days. Most patients take a week or two to resume more demanding activities, but occasionally they can take longer.</p><p>Outcomes of surgery may not be as successful in diabetics. As an example, a study evaluating the outcome of trigger finger treatment in diabetic patients found that 13 percent of diabetic patients who underwent surgery had an unsuccessful outcome compared with 6 percent of non-diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Diabetic patients may also have higher rates of complications like infections and surgical revisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Most patients who meet indications for surgery have poor prognoses without surgery, except for the few patients who undergo spontaneous improvement over time with the help of conservative management and pain control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
