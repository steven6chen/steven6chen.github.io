The underlying etiology often remains unclear despite extensive investigation.</p><p>In 1830, Sir Charles Bell first described unilateral facial weakness secondary to facial nerve dysfunction. His description of acquired, idiopathic facial paralysis is often termed Bell's palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This topic will review clinical aspects of facial nerve palsy in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FACIAL NERVE ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The facial nerve has a complex anatomy and function that render it susceptible to multiple neurologic disorders based upon the location of the lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55677\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55677 \">figure 1</a>). Cranial nerve VII originates from multiple brainstem nuclei that are functionally specialized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The motor component of VII, which accounts for movement of the facial musculature, arises from the motor nucleus of VII in the pontine tegmentum. Fibers innervating the forehead receive bilateral input via the corticobulbar tract, whereas the contralateral corticobulbar tract innervates the remaining facial muscles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The superior salivatory nucleus is the origin of preganglionic parasympathetic fibers that innervate the lacrimal, sublingual, and submandibular glands. Innervating fibers of the submandibular and sublingual gland travel via the chorda tympani nerve, whereas the lacrimal gland fibers travel through the greater petrosal nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taste for the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and sensory fibers from the external acoustic canal travel to the solitary tract nucleus.</p><p/><p>The fibers of the facial nerve emerge from the ventrolateral aspect of the brainstem at the caudal border of the pons and enter the petrous portion of the temporal bone via the internal auditory canal. The sensory fibers travel as the nervus intermedius portion of CN VII and run between cranial nerve VIII and the motor component of CN VII. In the temporal bone, the greater petrosal nerve arises from the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve and carries preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the pterygopalatine ganglion. The nerve then synapses and sends fibers to the lacrimal gland; lesions affecting the facial nerve prior to the greater petrosal nerve may cause decreased lacrimation. The facial nerve then courses along the medial wall of the anterior epitympanic recess; it is here that the facial nerve may be affected by cholesteatomas.</p><p>The mastoid segment of the facial nerve courses inferiorly, lateral to the jugular fossa, allowing lesions there to affect the facial nerve. The stapedius nerve arises from this segment and innervates the stapedius muscle. Lesions of the facial nerve prior to the stapedius nerve result in hyperacusis.</p><p>The chorda tympani arises distally in the mastoid segment and enters the middle ear via the canaliculus chordae tympani. It exits via the petrotympanic fissure and supplies afferent fibers for taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. It also provides efferent parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular and sublingual glands that synapse in the submandibular ganglion. The facial nerve exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen and courses through the parotid gland to divide and supply the muscles of facial expression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possible causes of facial nerve palsy are many and may be congenital, infectious, neoplastic, traumatic, or idiopathic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76593 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Approximately one-half of all cases qualify for the label &quot;Bell's palsy,&quot; previously defined as an acute facial nerve palsy of unknown cause. An estimated 20 per 100,000 people per year are affected by Bell's palsy, rendering it one of the more common referrals for neurologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Bell's palsy is the appellation commonly used to describe an acute peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause. However, the terms &quot;Bell's palsy&quot; and &quot;idiopathic facial paralysis&quot; may no longer be considered synonymous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. A peripheral facial palsy is a clinical syndrome of many causes, including herpes simplex virus activation; axonal spread and multiplication of a reactivated neurotropic virus leading to inflammation, demyelination, and dysfunction is the likely cause of Bell's palsy in many adult and some pediatric cases (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Herpes simplex virus'</a> below). Nevertheless, most patients with peripheral facial palsy are labelled as having Bell's palsy because there is no established or widely available method of confirming herpes simplex virus as the mechanism in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>No racial, geographic, or gender-based predilection exists for Bell's palsy, but there is a threefold greater risk during pregnancy (especially in the third trimester or in the first postpartum week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and a fourfold greater incidence in diabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The most common cause of acute onset facial nerve palsy in children has in the past been acute otitis media. However, Lyme disease may be a more common cause in endemic areas than otitis media, as illustrated by a study of 50 children with facial nerve palsy in Delaware [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The most common etiology was Lyme disease (50 percent), followed by acute otitis media (12 percent), varicella (6 percent), herpes zoster (4 percent), and coxsackievirus (2 percent). Idiopathic disease (Bell's palsy) was the diagnosis in 26 percent. At least one European study also found Lyme disease to be the most frequently identified cause of acute facial palsy in children, accounting for 16 of 27 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Bilateral facial palsy occurred only in children with Lyme disease in this study. However, mumps may be a frequent infectious cause in third world countries where it is endemic, as parotiditis produces a localized distal compressive neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital facial nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital facial nerve palsy may be the result of developmental defects or of traumatic etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76593 \">table 1</a>). Birth weight greater than 3500 grams, forceps-assisted delivery, and prematurity are all risk factors associated with traumatic facial palsy. The presence of multisystem dysmorphia and multiple cranial nerve abnormalities tend to favor developmental abnormalities, although isolated facial palsy can be of developmental origin.</p><p>A well-recognized form of congenital facial palsy is Moebius syndrome, which is typically accompanied by impairment of ocular abduction. In addition, two loci for isolated facial palsy of developmental origin have been identified, designated hereditary congenital facial paresis 1 and 2 on chromosomes 3q21-22 and 10q21.3-22.1 respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Other syndromes are also associated with facial palsies, including branchial arch malformation sequence disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76593 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In distinguishing developmental from traumatic facial palsies in the perinatal period, some or complete recovery of function favors traumatic lesions. Early motor nerve conduction study also helps distinguish these etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Electrodiagnostic studies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24001440\"><span class=\"h3\">Moebius syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moebius (Mobius) syndrome, sometimes called Moebius sequence, is a congenital facial palsy (unilateral or bilateral) with abnormalities of abducens (cranial nerve VI) function, though other cranial nerves (III, IV, V, VIII) may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Postmortem analysis has shown hypoplasia of the motor nucleus of the facial nerve with small or absent facial nerve rootlets exiting the brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A genetic cause has not yet been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], but linkage points to a distinct locus at 13q12.2-13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There is some overlap with the hereditary congenital facial paresis syndromes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, otitis media is a relatively common cause of acute facial nerve palsy. One group found that the incidence of facial nerve palsy was 0.16 percent, which was decreased from about 2 percent in the pre-antibiotic era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-complications#H111860927\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and complications&quot;, section on 'Other intratemporal complications'</a>.)</p><p>Bacterial infection of the middle ear usually is easily diagnosed by simple inspection of the external meatus and tympanic membrane. CT scan may allow for better visualization of the course of the facial nerve through the petrous portion of the temporal bone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-diagnosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The management of acute otitis media is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-otitis-media-in-children-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute otitis media in children: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Herpes simplex virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) activation is accepted as the likely cause of Bell's palsy in some pediatric cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/8,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23</a>] and most adult cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In one study, for example, HSV-1 genomes were identified in facial nerve endoneurial fluid and auricular muscle in 11 of 14 patients undergoing decompression surgery for Bell's palsy; the HSV-1 genomes were not found in controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a prospective case-control study of children presenting with acute unilateral facial nerve palsy, a positive PCR for HSV-1 was significantly more common in affected children (10 of 47 [21 percent]) compared with controls (4 of 45 [9 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similarly, a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HSV-1 was significantly more frequent in affected children (33 of 42 [79 percent]) compared with controls (16 of 41 [39 percent]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H539868757\"><span class=\"h2\">Varicella-zoster virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In societies where primary herpes zoster regularly occurs due to low immunization rates, varicella-zoster virus reactivation has been identified by PCR or serology in pediatric acute facial paralysis in up to 37 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Most such cases are characterized by acute peripheral facial nerve palsy in the absence of rash (ie, zoster sine herpete) while a few are notable for the presence of typical zoster lesions in the auditory canal and auricle, termed the Ramsay Hunt syndrome as discussed in the next section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3667112306\"><span class=\"h3\">Ramsay Hunt syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Ramsay Hunt syndrome is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (herpes zoster oticus); the virus lies dormant in the sensory ganglion after primary infection. Ramsay Hunt is characterized by facial paralysis associated with a painful vesicular eruption within the external auditory canal and vestibulocochlear dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;, section on 'Ramsay Hunt syndrome (Herpes zoster oticus)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lyme disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, Lyme disease has become the most common cause of acute facial nerve palsy among children in areas endemic for this infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Facial nerve palsy is the most common cranial neuropathy associated with Lyme meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Involvement of the facial nerve can be unilateral or bilateral and usually lasts less than two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;, section on 'Cranial nerve palsy'</a>.)</p><p>The mechanism by which Lyme disease causes facial nerve palsy may be related to direct invasion of the nerve by Borrelia burgdorferi. This possibility is suggested by studies that have found that virtually all children who have had a tick bite or erythema migrans in the head and neck region develop ipsilateral facial nerve palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/11,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,31</a>].</p><p>Patients with Lyme disease and facial nerve palsy may have other clinical features of Lyme disease, but many have no other symptoms, nor a history of tick bite or erythema migrans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Painless, non-tender swelling and erythema of the face preceding the facial palsy are distinctive features that may be present and help confirm the clinical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The likelihood that Lyme disease is the cause of a seventh nerve palsy diminishes in either nonendemic areas or at a time of year when Lyme disease is not prevalent.</p><p>In contrast to adults, most children with isolated Lyme disease facial palsy have abnormal cerebrospinal fluid findings, including an elevated white blood cell count, protein, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/11,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,34</a>]. However, the clinical significance of these abnormalities is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Lumbar puncture'</a> below.)</p><p>The evaluation of suspected Lyme-induced facial palsy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV infection rarely causes facial palsy. If it does, onset is at the time of seroconversion, when a CSF lymphocytosis usually is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In the later stages when cellular immunity wanes, the facial palsy is typically caused by another infection such as zoster, chronic demyelinating polyradiculopathy, or meningeal lymphomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Other infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other probable infectious causes of Bell's palsy include cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, adenovirus, rubella virus, mumps, influenza B, and coxsackievirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/1,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37</a>], although they have been implicated less conclusively. In addition, there are case reports of children with facial nerve palsy and serologic evidence of Rickettsia conorii infection (Mediterranean spotted fever) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Other conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of facial nerve palsy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholesteatoma should be suspected if the onset of facial palsy is gradual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Abortive forms outnumber the classic triad. Perivascular tuberculoid granulomas are seen in the edematous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], but the cause is unknown and treatment is unproven.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sarcoidosis should be considered, especially in patients with bilateral facial palsy. Acute or subacute onset of bilateral facial nerve palsy may be caused by numerous other disorders, including neuroborreliosis (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Lyme disease'</a> above), mumps, and Guillain-Barre syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Hypertension should be suspected in a pediatric patient, if facial palsy is associated with headache, altered level of consciousness, vomiting, convulsions, or focal central nervous system deficit.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with idiopathic facial nerve palsy (Bell&rsquo;s palsy) typically present with the sudden onset (usually over hours) of unilateral facial paralysis. Common findings include decreased forehead movement, sagging of the eyebrow, inability to close the eye, disappearance of the nasolabial fold, and drawing of the mouth to the unaffected side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Decreased tearing, hyperacusis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of taste sensation on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue may help to site the lesion in the facial canal but are more useful as an indicator of severity than of anatomic diagnosis. The presence of an ipsilateral abducens (ie, cranial nerve VI) palsy suggests the possibility of a brainstem lesion as the cause of the facial palsy, since the abducens nucleus is in close proximity to the fibers in the brainstem that exit as the facial nerve.</p><p>Facial movement is assessed by observing the response to commands for closing the eyes, elevating the brow, frowning, showing the teeth, puckering the lips, and tensing the soft tissues of the neck. The examination also includes a general physical examination and neurologic examination; particular attention should be directed at the external ear for vesicles or scabbing (which indicates Zoster) and for mass lesions within the parotid gland. Testing of taste is also helpful in localizing lesions of the facial nerve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral versus central lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sparing of the forehead muscles is suggestive of a central (upper motor neuron) lesion because of bilateral innervation to this area. However, this finding does not exclude a peripheral site of pathology in all cases.</p><p>Central activation of the facial nerve is both volitional and automatic or emotional in origin, and the facial nerve is the final common pathway. Thus, dissociation of movement of the face to command from spontaneous movement, as in smiling, indicates an upper motor neuron lesion. Lack of dissociation indicates a lower motor neuron (peripheral) lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Bell's palsy is based upon the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diffuse involvement of all of the distal branches of the facial nerve is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset is acute, over a day or two; the course is progressive, reaching maximal clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">weakness/paralysis</span> within three weeks or less from the first day of visible weakness; recovery of some degree of function usually occurs within six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated prodrome, ear pain, or dysacusis may be reported.</p><p/><p>Accurate diagnosis begins with a thorough history and physical examination. The history should address the time of onset, rapidity of progression, associated symptoms (eg, hyperacusis, lack of taste), and any systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus or chronic otitis media. A careful history should also include exposure to tick bites and HIV risk factors.</p><p>As mentioned, the primary etiologies of congenital facial nerve palsy include trauma and developmental abnormalities. In traumatic cases, a history of prolonged labor, forceps delivery, periauricular ecchymoses, or hemotympanum may help with diagnosis, but it is not diagnostic. It is important to look for associated dysmorphic features or multisystemic syndromal pathology. As an example, Goldenhar syndrome (craniofacial microsomia) has associated malar and maxillary hypoplasia and hemifacial microsomia, in addition to congenital facial paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The physical examination should include a careful assessment of facial musculature paralysis as well as careful examination of the ear, mastoid region, parotid gland, and neck. Examination of other cranial nerves, hearing, taste, salivation, and lacrimation may help localize the lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic testing for Lyme disease is recommended for all children with acute onset facial palsy when there is the possibility of exposure. Other adjunctive investigations, such as electrodiagnostic studies, neuroimaging, or lumbar puncture, may help identify an underlying etiology for facial nerve dysfunction and determine prognosis. However, these tests are not necessary in all patients. Patients who have a typical incomplete facial palsy and who recover do not need further study.</p><p>In contrast, electrodiagnostic studies may be warranted in patients with clinically complete lesions for prognostic purposes. Imaging is necessary if the physical signs are atypical (ie, involve neighboring cranial nerves), if chronic otitis media, acute mastoiditis, temporal bone trauma, or a neoplasm is suspected as the etiology, if progression is slow and extends beyond three weeks, or if no improvement has occurred at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192230175\"><span class=\"h3\">Lyme serologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic testing for Lyme disease is recommended for all children with acute onset facial palsy when there is the possibility of exposure in Lyme-endemic areas during the spring through autumn seasons. With the exception of the first four to six weeks of infection, serologic testing is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Occasionally the cranial neuropathy occurs before the patient has become seropositive; in such patients, follow-up serologic testing in several weeks is typically diagnostic.</p><p>When serologic testing for Lyme disease is indicated, two-tier testing is recommended, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by a Western blot as the tests of choice (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nervous-system-lyme-disease#H4821958\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nervous system Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Serologic testing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Serologic testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrodiagnostic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first days after symptoms onset, the blink reflex (stimulation of the supraorbital nerve) can confirm the peripheral origin of weakness and assess the degree of axonal conduction block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The simplest electrodiagnostic test is electromyography (EMG). In patients who have a clinically complete lesion, needle EMG may show some potentials on active volition, which allows one to conclude that the nerve is still in continuity with a potential for regrowth.</p><p>Motor nerve conduction study (motor NCS, also called electroneurography or evoked electromyography) is another electrodiagnostic test used for the evaluation of facial nerve palsy. It is usually obtained in patients with complete lesions for prognostic purposes. Motor NCS involves stimulating the main branch of the facial nerve near the stylomastoid foramen and recording the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in millivolts.</p><p>CMAP amplitudes reach their minimum level between 7 to 14 days after the onset of weakness in most patients. At approximately 10 days after the onset of symptoms, the amplitude of the CMAP on the paralyzed side compared with that on the normal side yields an estimate of the degree of axonal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The amplitude of the paralyzed side is compared with that of the normal side and is expressed as a percentage. This percentage is presumed to correspond to the number of surviving motor neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Thus, a CMAP value of 10 percent of normal corresponds with a degeneration or loss of 90 percent of the motor axons on that side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In normal individuals, a 5 to 20 percent difference between the two sides can exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>At approximately 20 to 30 days after onset, needle EMG may provide confirmation of muscle denervation and the degree of axonal damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In patients with axonal loss, needle EMG at about three months after onset may be used to assess for evidence of subclinical reinnervation from the facial nerve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging is necessary if the physical signs are atypical, if chronic otitis media, acute mastoiditis, temporal bone trauma, or a neoplasm is suspected as the etiology, if progression is slow and beyond three weeks, or if no improvement has occurred at six months.

MRI is the best study to evaluate the intraparotid facial nerve for inflammation, edema, or neoplasm. Contrast enhancement of the geniculate ganglion within the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve is common in Bell's palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, contrast enhancement of the first genu and proximal tympanic segment is typically normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Enhancement of the inner ear structures occurs only in herpes zoster facial palsy and can be taken to suggest this diagnosis even without a vesicular eruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Lumbar puncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbar puncture is recommended for children with cranial nerve palsy when there is clinical suspicion of meningitis (eg, severe or prolonged headache, fever, papilledema, or nuchal rigidity). A slight increase in monocytes and lymphocytes is compatible with Bell's palsy, but does not definitively diagnose the condition nor exclude an inflammatory process. The cerebrospinal fluid concentration of antibody to B. burgdorferi is highly specific for the diagnosis of central nervous system Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-puncture-indications-contraindications-technique-and-complications-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar puncture: Indications, contraindications, technique, and complications in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;, section on 'Cranial nerve palsy'</a>.)</p><p>Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is of limited utility for the diagnosis of Lyme disease when involvement is restricted to the peripheral nervous system, (eg, isolated facial nerve palsy and no signs of meningitis). Therefore, we suggest that children who have facial nerve palsy and Lyme disease undergo lumbar puncture only if they have clinical evidence of central nervous system infection.

In addition, we suggest early combined therapy with oral glucocorticoids plus valacyclovir (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose three times daily, maximum 1000 mg per dose) for one week for children with severe Bell's palsy.

However, the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy for Bell's palsy in adults is early short-term oral glucocorticoid treatment, which is established as effective by systematic reviews and meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-57</a>] of randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/58-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-64</a>].

A 2013 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation made no recommendation regarding surgical decompression because the evidence consisted of low-quality, nonrandomized studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Thus, the use of early surgery for children with facial nerve palsy should be studied further before considering this as a treatment option.</p><p>Surgical reanimation techniques may be considered in children with congenital or permanently acquired facial nerve palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. These techniques do not completely restore normal physiologic function, although they may aid the child psychologically. Surgical procedures are divided into static procedures that provide symmetry of the mouth at rest and reanimation techniques that allow facial expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/71-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-75</a>].

The Copenhagen Facial Nerve study evaluated the natural history of 2570 cases of peripheral nerve palsy over a 25-year period, including 463 children younger than 15 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. A full recovery was achieved by 90 percent of these children. In another case series of 32 episodes of Bell's palsy in 29 children, complete recovery occurred in 31 episodes and was unrelated to treatment with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p/><p>The prognosis of Bell's palsy is related primarily to the severity of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. A simple rule is that clinically incomplete lesions tend to recover. The House-Brackmann grading system was devised both as a clinical indicator of severity, as well as an objective record of progress (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70562\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70562 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. On this scale, grades I and II have good outcomes, grades III and IV characterize moderate dysfunction, and grades V and VI portend a poor result. Limited data suggest that electrophysiologic measures of facial nerve function are more reliable than the House-Brackmann for estimating prognosis in cases with more severe facial nerve injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>Motor nerve conduction studies have proved useful for determining the prognosis of idiopathic facial palsy. One group noted that 84 percent of patients with CMAP amplitude responses greater than 30 percent of normal had complete recovery of facial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. A CMAP response less than 10 percent suggests a poor prognosis and surgical consideration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], although one-third of patients may have complete recovery even when CMAP amplitudes show 90 to 98 percent degeneration. In one study of patients with 90 percent reduction in CMAP who underwent middle cranial fossa decompression, 50 percent had a better final recovery than did control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>The prognosis of Bell's palsy is favorable if some recovery is seen within the first 21 days of onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. A diagnosis of Bell's palsy is doubtful if some facial function, however small, has not returned within three to four months, and additional evaluation to determine the etiology is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-nerve-palsy-in-children/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>In severe lesions that recover, the outgrowth of new axons from the injury site is not discretely directed but is disorganized and misdirected; on volitional activation of the facial nerve, a mass action of facial musculature or synkinesis ensues. Thus, on blinking there is twitching of the angle of the mouth, and on smiling the eye may close or wink. Similarly, with misdirected autonomic fibers, a salivary stimulus may result in excess lacrimation, the syndrome of &quot;crocodile tears.&quot;</p><p>The recurrence rate of Bell's palsy in children is less than 10 percent, similar to that in adults.

However, imaging is necessary if the physical signs are atypical (eg, involve neighboring cranial nerves), if chronic otitis media, acute mastoiditis, temporal bone trauma, or a neoplasm is suspected as the etiology, if progression is slow and extends beyond three weeks, or if no improvement has occurred at six months.
