A sample can be obtained in 90 percent or more of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is important to remember, however, that all sampling devices do not provide visualization of the uterine cavity. Thus, they perform better when pathology is global rather than focal, eg, a polyp. Depending on the details of the abnormal imaging result, a normal office endometrial sampling may require additional operative intervention (eg, dilation and curettage [D&amp;C], hysteroscopy). Endometrial sampling should provide a histologic specimen of adequate volume for the pathologist to identify endometrial pathology, and the adequacy of the sample may depend upon the operator's technique. Society of Gynecologic Oncology guidelines advise against use of devices that yield crushed (jawed devices), cauterized (hot loops), or very small (jawed devices) samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392089\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392116\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for endometrial sampling include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for endometrial neoplasia in women with abnormal uterine bleeding or specific cervical cytology results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58600 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surveillance for endometrial cancer in women who are at high risk or have a history of endometrial neoplasia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of an imaging study (eg, pelvic ultrasound) that shows endometrial pathology prior to an operative intervention</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment for chronic subclinical endometritis as an explanation for adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p/><p>Women who have undergone uterus-sparing therapy for endometrial cancer should, at the least, have regular endometrial sampling.

There are no consistent guidelines for screening of women with other risk factors. This must be determined on an individual basis. Also, in some ethnic or geographic populations (eg, American Samoa), the incidence of endometrial cancer may be increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In general, endometrial sampling may be performed in women who are on anticoagulant therapy if coagulation parameters have consistently been within the standard therapeutic range. Laboratory testing should be performed within one month prior to the biopsy. If biopsy is required in a patient with an uncontrolled bleeding diathesis, consultation should be sought from the clinician managing this aspect of the patient&rsquo;s care. These patients may need to have anticoagulation reversed or have other treatments (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a>). Patients with an uncontrolled bleeding diathesis should undergo endometrial sampling in an operating room setting with access to blood products and anesthesia.

This does not apply to clinical situations in which the indication for the biopsy is to evaluate for a subclinical infection.</p><p>In rare instances, in which endometrial sampling needs to be performed in a woman with cervical cancer, an obstructing cervical lesion may be a relative contraindication in some patients due to increased risk of bleeding or uterine perforation.</p><p>Sampling can be performed with an intrauterine device in place. In our practice, we have done so without complications. In addition, an ongoing clinical trial reports doing so as part of the study design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. No studies have evaluated whether performing endometrial sampling with an intrauterine device in place decreases the diagnostic performance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391905\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPROCEDURE PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391808\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Office sampling procedures can usually be performed without significant pain. Discomfort can be minimized by reassuring the woman, explaining each step before doing it, and avoiding use of mechanical cervical dilators <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a tenaculum, if possible. Most clinicians recommend an oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) 30 to 60 minutes prior to the procedure to decrease cramping, and some administer a paracervical block or use an intrauterine instillation of local anesthetic. Intrauterine instillation of a local anesthetic has been found to be more effective than placebo in randomized trials, although one trial found a significant effect only when the anesthetic was combined with an NSAID (5 mL of intrauterine 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> and 550 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> sodium) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Sterile preparation in women who are allergic to iodine is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-preoperative-evaluation-and-preparation-for-gynecologic-surgery#H17329983\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of preoperative evaluation and preparation for gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Vaginal preparation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In many women, an endometrial sampling device can be inserted without grasping the cervix with a tenaculum. Use of a tenaculum increases patient discomfort. <br/><br/>A tenaculum should be used if the uterus is not close to axial in position. In such cases, place a tenaculum (with teeth in a horizontal position) on the anterior cervical lip and retract outwardly to straighten the cervicouterine angle. Straightening the uterine axis may reduce the risk of uterine perforation. If a tenaculum is required and a paracervical block has not been given, we may apply a local anesthetic (eg, 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzocaine</a> gel or 20% benzocaine spray) to the intended site before placing the tenaculum. Directing the patient to cough while simultaneously applying the tenaculum may also decrease discomfort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using steady and moderate pressure, slowly insert the sampling device through the cervical os and on to the uterine fundus. Stop when resistance is met.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the device will not pass through the cervix, attach a tenaculum (if not already in place) and use a series of small (1 to 4 mm) Hegar dilators to gently dilate the canal. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many devices are marked with centimeters, so the device can be used to measure the uterine depth. Average uterine length is 6 to 8 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stabilize the sheath with one hand and pull the piston out as far as possible to create suction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Move the device tip along the endometrial surface using a corkscrew rotation combined with a repeating cephalic-caudal motion while maintaining suction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the device when the entire cavity has been sampled. Expel the specimen into a formalin container. If there appears to be insufficient tissue for diagnosis, perform a second pass the device. The same device may be used if it has not been contaminated; it should not have touched the formalin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the tenaculum, if present. Most bleeding can be controlled with pressure via cotton swabs or a sponge stick. If bleeding persists, use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a> solution (Monsel's solution) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a> sticks to cauterize the site.</p><p/><p>When using a suction device, do not let the sheath come outside of the external os or you will lose the negative pressure. If you do, simply expel the contents of the sheath into the formalin container or onto a sterile nonadhesive bandage (eg, Telfa), taking care not to contaminate the device, and reinsert the sheath. Multiple passes are sometimes needed to assure specimen adequacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOMETRIAL SUCTION DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suction devices for endometrial sampling consist of a plunger within a sheath. When the sheath is inserted into the uterus, the plunger is retracted, creating negative pressure that draws tissue into the sampling device. Most suction sampling devices utilize low pressure. However, some devices use a canister or syringe at the proximal end to create higher pressure, which removes a greater quantity of tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392333\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-pressure devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-pressure endometrial suction devices (eg, Pipelle, Endocell) are the most popular method for sampling the endometrial lining. They are typically constructed of flexible polypropylene with an outer sheath that is approximately &lt;3 mm in diameter. The device has a 2.4 mm or smaller side port at the distal end, through which the endometrial sample is obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69403\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69403 \">picture 1</a>). The flexibility of this type of sampler allows the cannula to conform to the contour of the uterus and minimizes cramping.</p><p>In a typical procedure, 5 to 15 percent of the endometrial surface area is sampled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Failure to obtain tissue occurs in approximately 0 to 8 percent of low-pressure endometrial suction device procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>].</p><p>One approach to improving the tissue adequacy rate is by using a technique that combines a corkscrew twisting motion and uterine curettage. When using this method, the device is inserted to the fundus and then withdrawn to the lower uterine segment, alternating between a corkscrew twisting motion and the motion usually used to curette the endometrium during a dilation and curettage. Data are limited on the relative efficacy of the combined approach. In a retrospective chart review with uniform pathology evaluation, use of a corkscrew twisting motion and uterine curettage yielded adequate tissue in 95 percent of cases, which was higher than the 77 percent success rate with a corkscrew technique alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilation-and-curettage#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dilation and curettage&quot;, section on 'Curettage'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H392389\"><span class=\"h2\">Higher-pressure devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher-pressure devices (eg, Vabra aspirator, Karman cannula) are used less frequently than low-pressure devices because they are less comfortable for the patient. They are also less flexible, and typically require use of a tenaculum, cervical dilation, and a paracervical block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>An advantage of the Vabra and Karman systems is that they yield a large tissue sample, comparable to dilation and curettage. These devices are particularly useful in women with moderate bleeding, since, in our experience, they can circumvent the intrauterine clots and reach the endometrial surface more reliably than low-pressure devices.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vabra &ndash; The Vabra aspirator is available as a 4 mm disposable plastic or a 2 or 3 mm stainless steel device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69403\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69403 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Suction is initiated via an external vacuum pump, which can be noisy. The tissue sample is retrieved from a tissue trap and placed in formalin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Karman &ndash; The Karman cannula comes in diameters of 4 to 6 mm and is made of flexible plastic with two ports at the distal end [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Suction is provided by a reusable syringe connected to the disposable cannula. An external vacuum pump can also be used.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOMETRIAL BRUSH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endometrial brush (eg, Tao Brush) is a disposable device with a brush at the distal end, similar to the brush commonly used for endocervical sampling.</p><p>Several observational studies have compared endometrial sampling results from the endometrial brush with those of an endometrial suction sampling device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. In the largest study, 526 pre- and postmenopausal women were evaluated using both the Tao Brush and the Pipelle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In the postmenopausal women, endometrial sampling with the brush resulted in a significantly higher proportion of adequate endometrial samples compared with the suction device, whether the techniques were performed with (83 versus 50 percent) or without (61 versus 36 percent) the assistance of hysteroscopy. In premenopausal women, no differences were found between the two techniques in regard to adequacy of sampling.</p><p>Another approach is to use the brush and suction device sequentially during the same procedure. In one study of 101 women, combined use had a sensitivity and specificity of 100 percent for diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SIDE EFFECTS AND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effect of endometrial sampling is cramping, which subsides rapidly after the procedure is completed. Cramping tends to be more severe with the higher-pressure suction devices than low-pressure devices because the former is more rigid, the suction is greater, and larger samples are removed. Many women will experience light vaginal bleeding or spotting for several days following the procedure.</p><p>Vasovagal reactions are not uncommon during endometrial sampling. Such reactions can generally be prevented by allowing the patient to eat and drink before the procedure and by minimizing pain through use of analgesics and, if necessary, local anesthesia. The risk of uterine perforation is approximately 1 to 2 per 1000 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-sampling-procedures/abstract/17,21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,27</a>].</p><p>Rare complications include excessive uterine bleeding (especially with undiagnosed coagulopathies), uterine perforation (risk, 0.1 to 1.3 percent), pelvic infection, and bacteremia (including sepsis and endocarditis).</p><p>Uterine perforation during office endometrial biopsy is rare and is difficult to detect. Most cases are likely to be asymptomatic, or the patient may have atypical pain during the procedure. Theoretically, leakage of clear peritoneal-type fluid from the vagina may indicate a possible perforation; however, this is a nonspecific finding. If perforation is suspected, additional measures should be taken for evaluation and management. In our practice, if we have a small, but low suspicion of a perforation, we counsel the patient to call with worsening abdominal pain or fever. Uterine perforation is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine perforation during gynecologic procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTPROCEDURE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The women should remain in a semirecumbent position for several minutes after the procedure to reduce the chance of a vasovagal episode. She may then leave the office if she is not light-headed and there is no heavy bleeding. Cramping can be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, although persistent cramping is unusual.</p><p>The patient should call to report any fever, cramping continuing for 48 hours or more, increasing pain, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, or bleeding heavier than a normal period. She may resume her usual activities, including coitus, as soon as she is ready.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
