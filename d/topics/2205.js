Treatment of breast cancer (eg, surgery, radiation therapy) can lead to lymphedema and is one of the most common causes of secondary peripheral lymphedema. Upper extremity lymphedema occurring in breast cancer patients, including risk factors, monitoring, prevention, and efficacy of lymphedema treatments, will be reviewed here. General considerations for the diagnosis and management of lymphedema that includes other etiologies, and surgical treatment of lymphedema, are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-primary-and-secondary-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of primary and secondary lymphedema&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20353047\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphedema occurs when the lymphatic load exceeds the transport capacity of the lymphatic system, which causes filtered fluid to accumulate in the interstitium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Lymphedema that occurs as the result of other conditions or treatments is called secondary lymphedema. Breast cancer-associated lymphedema (BCAL) occurs due to obstruction of the lymphatic channels or lymph nodes, or infiltration with tumor cells (lymphangitic carcinomatosis). More commonly, surgical removal of lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy) and radiation therapy lead to development of lymphedema in patients with breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H20353119\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20344721\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphatic drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the upper extremity and chest wall, the superficial lymphatic system (lymphatic capillaries and precollectors) drains interstitial fluid from the skin and subcutaneous tissue into larger collecting vessels (ie, deep lymphatics). The deep lymphatics drain into the axillary lymph nodes where foreign material is filtered and where antigen-presenting cells interact with T and B cells to activate immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The lymphatics of the breast drain into the internal mammary nodes medially, and the axillary and supraclavicular nodes laterally and superiorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F74746\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74746 \">figure 1</a>). The lymph draining from the left upper body (upper extremity, chest wall, upper back, shoulder, and breast) enters the venous circulation through the thoracic duct, which opens into the venous angle between the left subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57280\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57280 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The lymph draining from the right upper body drains into the right venous angle via the right lymphatic duct. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20344910\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast cancer and its associated treatments are one of the most common causes of upper extremity lymphedema. In a systematic review that included 72 studies (n = 29,612 women), the overall incidence of arm lymphedema in breast cancer survivors was 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence varied based on the mode of diagnosis; it was 13, 15, and 20 percent based on clinical information, formal measurement (eg, arm circumference), and self-assessment, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H802880404\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20353119\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main risk factors for breast cancer-associated lymphedema (BCAL) include <span class=\"nowrap\">dissection/disruption</span> of axillary lymph nodes, radiation therapy, local infection, and obesity, but other factors may also contribute. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20353213\"><span class=\"h3\">Axillary node dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphadenectomy is the primary cause of breast and upper extremity lymphedema in patients with breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]. The incidence of lymphedema increases with increasing number of axillary nodes removed or disrupted. In a systematic review, the incidence of lymphedema was approximately four times higher in women who had an axillary lymph node dissection compared with those who had sentinel node biopsy (19.9 versus 5.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among patients who have undergone complete axillary node dissection, lymphedema developed in 28 percent, in one review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Fortunately, contemporary surgical treatment of breast cancer does not automatically mandate axillary node dissection in women with clinically node-negative axilla. Instead, most women undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy, which is associated with a significantly lower risk of lymphedema compared with axillary node dissection (odds ratio [OR] 0.36, 95% CI 0.15-0.86) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H884706130\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Cancer and cancer treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the regional lymph nodes in breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20345254\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative radiation therapy (breast, axilla, supraclavicular region) also increases the risk for lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In a systematic review, the incidence of lymphedema was significantly higher among women who underwent surgery plus radiation therapy compared with surgery alone (41 versus 17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among women who have undergone axillary node dissection, radiation therapy is an additive risk factor. In one report, the incidences of subjective lymphedema with axillary node dissection alone and axillary node dissection plus radiation therapy were 7 and 38 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Women undergoing breast-conserving therapy are also at risk for lymphedema following adjuvant radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. A retrospective study involved 1497 women treated for breast cancer between 1980 and 2006 (75 percent with node-negative breast cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For the entire cohort, the reported incidence of lymphedema was 7 percent. For women treated with supraclavicular, axillary, or internal mammary radiation therapy, the incidences of lymphedema were 10, 15, and 8 percent, respectively. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20353253\"><span class=\"h3\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beyond lymphadenectomy and radiation therapy, the likelihood of developing lymphedema is related to increased body mass index or obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; postoperative infection, hematoma, or seroma; and possibly medication effects (eg, taxanes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]). Weight gain is a contributory factor to the development of lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; obesity alone may impair lymphatic function and lead to the development of lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H802872652\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Obesity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20353594\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY AND MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following treatment for breast cancer, the onset of lymphedema is insidious and is typically characterized by slowly progressive swelling of the upper extremity ipsilateral to the axillary node dissection or radiation treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>At first, the swelling may be apparent only in the proximal portion of the limb, or it can affect only a portion of the distal limb including the digits. There may also be swelling over the ipsilateral breast <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> upper chest wall. In one systematic review, the greatest risk for developing upper extremity lymphedema was within the first two years following diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a study that included 1713 women who underwent breast-conserving therapy, 40 percent of those who presented with arm edema had mild lymphedema at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Freedom from progression to more severe lymphedema was 79 percent at one year, 66 percent at three years, and 52 percent at five years. Women who were morbidly obese, had positive axillary lymph nodes, or received supraclavicular irradiation at the time of breast cancer treatment had a higher risk of progression from mild to more severe arm edema. </p><p>Early identification of those women at risk for lymphedema and secondary prevention measures may potentially keep lymphedema from progressing to a higher clinical stage; lymphedema is often difficult to treat if it progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In a case-control study of 196 breast cancer patients, the application of a surveillance program that included preoperative limb volume measurement and interval postoperative follow-up was able to detect subclinical lymphedema (defined as a 3 percent difference in arm circumference), reduce affected limb volume with early treatment (with a compression sleeve and gauntlet), and maintain this volume reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20354992\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prevention'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>Measurements of arm circumference <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volume are common methods for monitoring the onset and degree of lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Other methods, such as measurements of bioimpedance, tissue compression (tonometry), and local tissue water, have also been investigated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>]. Clinical measurements are obtained initially to establish a baseline before breast cancer treatments and afterward at intervals to track changes during treatment. Alternatively, changes in arm circumference or volume relative to the contralateral normal limb can be performed. There is currently no consensus on how frequently these measurements should be performed, nor on the frequency of follow-up of women at risk for developing lymphedema. However, given that the highest risk of developing lymphedema is within the first three years of treatment and that early intervention can limit progression of disease, high-risk patients should be followed closely in this period (eg, every six months or if they develop symptoms). In addition, patients should be taught how to self-monitor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H4164439\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Extremity measurements'</a> and <a href=\"#H20349799\" class=\"local\">'Preventive measures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20349799\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTIVE MEASURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20355012\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with breast cancer, primary prevention mainly involves using sentinel lymph node biopsy for axillary lymph node staging rather than axillary node dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This practice effectively reduces the risk of upper extremity lymphedema. The use of axillary staging with sentinel node biopsy has reduced the number of axillary lymph node dissections performed and, consequently, the incidence of lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Clinically relevant lymphedema occurs in 5 to 9 percent of patients who undergo sentinel node biopsy alone compared with approximately 40 percent in patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/2,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,33-36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other measures may also be effective for primary prevention. These include minimizing the extent of lymph node dissection when it is required, advanced radiation therapy (RT) techniques that limit radiation, and the use of other surgical techniques (eg, reverse mapping, lymphatic bypass) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20354992\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No secondary measures are known with certainty to prevent lymphedema, but the measures discussed below may reduce severity once lymphedema develops. The goal of secondary prevention is to control limb swelling. Among breast cancer patients with any of the risk factors for lymphedema discussed, but without limb swelling (lymphedema stage 0), we suggest the general measures listed below, including compression therapy, and limb exercise once any wounds have healed and provided there are no surgical complications that may interfere. (See <a href=\"#H20353119\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H517750338\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'At risk for postoperative lymphedema'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H479033\"><span class=\"h3\">General measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of general measures are aimed at minimizing the degree of edema and slowing the rate of progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>].

This recommendation is based upon several factors. Blood pressure measurement in an enlarged extremity will be inaccurate if the cuff is not properly sized and the cuff causes a high-pressure focal compression (in contrast to pneumatic compression devices used for lymphedema treatment, for which the compression is applied sequentially) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/40,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,47</a>]. Among the rare patients who have undergone bilateral axillary lymph node dissection and have bilateral lymphedema, routine blood pressure measurements can be obtained in the lower extremity. If the patient has had bilateral axillary lymph node dissection and there is not an option of obtaining blood pressure measurements in the lower extremity, then a manual (but not automatic) blood pressure cuff can be used intermittently, but inflated to only just above the expected level of systolic blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

One study prospectively investigated the association between factors thought to increase the risk for lymphedema in 632 patients treated for breast cancer and screened routinely for lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. On multivariate analysis, there was no significant association between increases in arm volume and blood pressure readings. Significant factors included body mass index &ge;25, axillary lymph node dissection, regional lymph node irradiation, and cellulitis. There was no association between blood pressure readings on the ipsilateral arm and cellulitis.

Once any wounds have healed and provided there are no surgical complications that may interfere (eg, need for a drain), exercise and weight training should be encouraged. Properly fitted compression garments should be worn during exercise, including aerobic and resistance training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H517753391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Diet and exercise'</a> and <a href=\"#H3155631395\" class=\"local\">'Compression therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Upper body exercise is safe in women treated by axillary lymph node dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/50-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-64</a>]. Prophylactic physiotherapy in the form of manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) may offer an additional benefit. In one clinical trial, 116 women with unilateral axillary lymph node dissection were randomly assigned to education and early physiotherapy and progressive active and action-assisted shoulder exercises, or to education alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. After 12 months of follow-up, significantly fewer women treated with prophylactic physiotherapy developed lymphedema (7 versus 25 percent with education alone).

Limb compression uses multilayered padding materials and short-stretch (also called low-stretch) bandages. Maintenance therapy uses fitted compression garments (at least Class I compression) worn during waking hours. A compression hand piece, either a glove or a gauntlet, is necessary when wearing a compression sleeve to prevent swelling in the hand. When correctly fitted and worn properly, compression garments can help reduce swelling; however, poorly fitted garments can be restrictive and can exacerbate lymphedema.

A systematic review that included six trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/82,88-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,88-90</a>] concluded that MLD is safe and noted that MLD may offer additional benefit to compression bandaging for reducing swelling, more so for women with mild-to-moderate breast cancer-related lymphedema as compared with moderate-to-severe lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In one of these trials with 31 women with BCAL, the reduction in excess volume and dermal thickness in the arm treated with MLD was greater compared with simple lymphatic drainage (SLD, a commonly taught self-help maneuver) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. MLD also significantly improved several quality-of-life domains, including emotional function, occurrence of dyspnea, and disturbances in sleep. It should be noted that not all studies have found a benefit for MLD. As an example, in one trial, 42 women with lymphedema were randomly assigned to standard therapy (compression garments, physical exercises, and education) with or without a short course of MLD (eight sessions in two weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. After a follow-up of 12 months, both groups had a similar reduction in arm volume, suggesting that MLD had little impact over standard management. In another study involving 156 patients, all received guidelines about the prevention of lymphedema and exercise therapy with randomization to treatment with MLD or no other therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

In these studies, reductions in limb volume range from 30 to 70 percent. However, patient compliance is required for long-term success. In one study, at least 90 percent of the lymphedema reduction was maintained in compliant patients at an average follow-up of nine months, while noncompliant patients lost approximately one-third of the initial benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Small randomized trials in patients with BCAL have mixed results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/106-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">106-108</a>].</p><p>In a small phase trial, 53 patients with BCAL were randomly assigned to CDT (lymph drainage, multilayer compression bandaging, elevation, remedial exercise, and skin care) or standard physiotherapy (bandages, elevation, head-neck and shoulder exercises, and skin care) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. The group receiving CDT had a significantly greater improvement in edema as measured by circumferential and volumetric measurements. A separate trial suggested minimal benefit for CDT over compression garments as a first-line treatment of lymphedema. In this trial, 95 patients with BCAL were randomly assigned to CDT or compression garments alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. A greater absolute reduction in arm volume was seen for CDT compared with compression garments (250 versus 142 mL), but the mean reduction in arm volume was not significantly different (29 versus 23 percent). There were no differences in severe adverse events. Several factors may limit the applicability of the findings of these trials. The trial was small and may lack sufficient power to detect a significant volume difference. Also, the study excluded patients who had not responded to conservative strategies (eg, compression garments or bandaging). However, another small trial involving 52 patients with BCAL following mastectomy also found no significant difference in relative volume change for CDT compared with compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20352061\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent pneumatic compression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC; also called sequential pneumatic compression) is another method of compression therapy for patients with typically severe lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

A systematic review of IPC in patients with BCAL identified seven trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].

On the other hand, IPC may still be an effective addition to a multimodality lymphedema treatment regimen. One of these trials randomly assigned 23 patients with unilateral previously untreated BCAL to CDT alone or with adjunctive IPC (30 minutes daily for 10 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. A significantly greater reduction in limb volume during initial treatment was seen for combined therapy compared with CDT alone (45 versus 26 percent). A second arm of the trial evaluated the efficacy of maintenance IPC therapy (self-administered 60 minutes daily) added to CDT in 27 patients with unilateral breast cancer-associated lymphedema who had previously been treated with CDT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. At 6 to 12 months, a fall in mean limb volume occurred with combined therapy compared with an increase with CDT alone (-90 versus +33 mL), a difference that was statistically significant. </p><p>In addition to the paucity of data demonstrating benefit from IPC in women with BCAL, there are a number of concerns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ideal pressure for the pump is not known, and some investigators suggest that a pressure greater than 60 mmHg may injure lymphatic vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IPC is usually applied daily or five times per week. However, the optimal duration of IPC is not known, as in different studies, the sessions have varied in length (90 minutes to as long as six hours) and duration (two to three days to four weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-cancer-associated-lymphedema/abstract/81,90,104,110,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,90,104,110,115</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, IPC may be considered an adjunct in patients who do not respond well to CDT and compression garments. If the lymphedema is controlled with IPC, a gradient pressure garment should be worn to prevent further limb swelling. Clinical experience has shown that IPC may be an alternative maintenance program for lymphedema patients who have difficulty in performing self-MLD secondary to weakness, fatigue, or range of motion deficits.

(See <a href=\"#H3770720030\" class=\"local\">'Manual lymphatic drainage'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with moderate-to-severe lymphedema (ISL stages II to III) and no contraindications, we suggest intensive physiotherapy, usually in the form of complete decongestive therapy, rather than less intense therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) Complete decongestive therapy (CDT) refers to a two-phase (treatment phase, maintenance phase) multicomponent technique that is designed to reduce the degree of lymphedema and to maintain the health of the skin and supporting structures. (See <a href=\"#H20350683\" class=\"local\">'Complete decongestive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with severe lymphedema (ISL stage III) may also benefit from intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in addition to CDT. IPC (also called sequential pneumatic compression) devices employ a plastic sleeve or stocking that is intermittently inflated over the affected limb. Most pneumatic compression pumps sequentially inflate a series of chambers in a distal-to-proximal direction. (See <a href=\"#H20352061\" class=\"local\">'Intermittent pneumatic compression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For selected patients with severe lymphedema or complications related to lymphedema, surgery may be an option with the goals of alleviating pain and discomfort and reducing the risk of infection, among others. (See <a href=\"#H20419421\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of lymphedema include skin infections (cellulitis, erysipelas, and lymphangitis), lymphangiosarcoma, and reduced quality of life, including aspects of emotional, functional, physical, and social well-being. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-staging-and-conservative-management-of-peripheral-lymphedema#H425569\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3743348883\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Emile R Mohler, III, MD, who passed away in October 2017.
