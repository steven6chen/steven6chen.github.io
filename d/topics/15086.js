Vitamin K is unique among the available reversal agents in achieving a sustained reversal of warfarin-induced anticoagulation, and therefore is almost always administered as part of a reversal regimen, because of the prolonged half-life of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>.

Eight units of FFP are often required to fully reverse the coagulation defect in patients treated with warfarin or other <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> antagonists; the total number of units required depends on the extent of INR prolongation. Other plasma products (eg, thawed Plasma, PF24) are considered clinically interchangeable with FFP. Thawed plasma (ie, FFP that has been thawed and maintained at refrigerator temperature) may be available more rapidly than FFP because it is already thawed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-plasma-components#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of plasma components&quot;, section on 'Plasma products'</a>.)</p><p>Advantages of FFP include that it is widely available, with a long history of clinical use, and is inexpensive relative to other reversal options. The cost for a course of treatment with FFP in a patient with warfarin-associated ICH and an INR of 3.0 has been variably estimated to be $200 to $400 US dollars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Administration of FFP as the sole reversal agent is problematic for the following reasons: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large volumes (approximately 2 liters) are required. This volume load can be prohibitive, especially in patients with underlying cardiac disease, and in theory, may exacerbate cerebral edema and intracranial pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can take at least 30 minutes to check for blood compatibility (ie, ABO) and thaw each unit of FFP, and 30 minutes or more to administer each FFP unit. Therefore, it can take eight hours or longer to give eight units of FFP, during which time the hematoma may expand. This was illustrated in a series of 45 patients with ICH, in which the median time interval between admission to a neuro-intensive care unit and INR normalization with FFP administration (ie, INR &le;1.2) was 30 hours (range: 14 to 50 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Without concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> administration, the effect of FFP on the INR may not be completely sustained, and may last no more than several hours. Consequently, when FFP is used for anticoagulation reversal, it is typical to also administer vitamin K.</p><p/><p>In contrast to its use as a single reversal agent, FFP is sometimes used together with three-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) to provide a source of factor VII because three-factor PCCs contain little or no factor VII. In these cases, smaller volumes of FFP may be utilized (eg, two units).

Those that contain relatively little factor VII are called three-factor PCC, while those that contain factor VII are called four-factor PCC. Most PCC preparations contain low doses of heparin to prevent clotting factor activation. They also contain variable amounts of protein C and protein S, vitamin K-dependent anticoagulants that co-purify with the clotting proteins. It is unknown whether these components attenuate the thrombotic risk of PCC preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>PCCs normalize the INR more rapidly than infusion of FFP or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> alone, often within 10 minutes of administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/18,20,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,23-26</a>].

Delayed administration of treatment may obscure the potential clinical benefit of therapy.</p><p>Thrombotic events have complicated infusion of PCC, but this risk is difficult to quantify due to varying preparations, doses, and differing patient populations in available reports. Among most series, thrombotic complications occurred in 1.5 to 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/20,30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,30-34</a>].

A systematic review of 18 studies and 654 patients with warfarin-associated bleeding (mostly ICH or gastrointestinal bleeding) or urgent surgery found that INR correction was more reliable with four-factor PCC than with three-factor PCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Dosing was variable: some studies used fixed dosing; some used weight-based dosing. No study included a direct comparison of three versus four-factor PCCs. A reduction in INR to &le;1.5 within one hour of PCC administration was seen in six of nine studies employing three-factor PCCs, and in 12 of 13 studies employing four-factor PCCs; the single four-factor PCC study that did not meet this endpoint used a lower-than-average PCC dose (200 IU). This study did not compare rates of adverse events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168424208\"><span class=\"h3\">Supplements to three-factor PCC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absence of significant levels of factor VII in three-factor PCCs raises the question of whether administration of a three-factor PCC should be supplemented with a source of factor VII. Options include FFP or recombinant activated factor VII [rFVIIa]. </p><p>There are no data that directly compare clinical outcomes or adverse event rates for three-factor PCC with or without a source of factor VII. The decision of whether to add a separate source of factor VII to three-factor PCC depends on perceived risks of incomplete reversal without a separate source of factor VII versus the possibility of an increased risk of thrombotic events if supplemental FFP or rFVIIa is given. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Recombinant factor VIIa'</a> below.)</p><p>When rFVIIa is used to supplement three-factor PCC, we prefer a lower dose (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> rather than higher doses. This is based on data from a randomized trial in 841 patients with spontaneous ICH (ie, not warfarin-associated) that compared two doses of rFVIIa (80 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> with placebo; PCC was not administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The primary outcome (severe disability or death) was similar among the three groups, despite less expansion of the hemorrhage in those receiving rFVIIa. Overall, thromboembolic events were similar in the three groups, but severe events (cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction) were more common in those who received high-dose rFVIIa compared with placebo (8 versus 4 percent). </p><p>When FFP is used to supplement three-factor PCC, we use less (eg, 2 units) than is typical when FFP is used alone as a reversal agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Recombinant factor VIIa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally do not recommend the use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) alone for treatment of warfarin-associated ICH.</p><p>There are limited studies of rFVIIa as the primary reversal agent for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>&ndash;associated ICH. In an initial study in seven patients, rFVIIa (initial dose: 10 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> was reported to normalize INR within 10 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In another report of seven patients, similarly rapid reversal was achieved; however, lasting reversal required coadministration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> and FFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The half-life of rFVIIa is short, approximately 2.3 hours. </p><p>Reasons for not using rFVIIa as a primary reversal agent include concerns about associated risk of thrombosis. A large multicenter randomized trial of rFVIIa in 841 patients with ICH not associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> found no benefit of treatment on the primary clinical outcomes of death and disability, and found higher rates of arterial thromboembolic serious adverse events (stroke, MI) in patients assigned to the higher dose (80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> treatment group. A case series of 101 patients with warfarin-associated intracranial hemorrhage treated with rFVIIa (mean dose 52 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> reported thromboembolic complications in eight patients (seven deep vein thromboses, one stroke) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Other studies have also suggested an association between rFVIIa and serious thromboembolic events. These and other studies are discussed in more detail separately.

This occurs because the prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/INR</span> is sensitive to reductions in the level of factor VII. A normal INR in this setting may give a potentially false sense of security that the bleeding diathesis has been corrected. An additional consideration is that the cost for a course of treatment with rFVIIa in a patient with ICH and an INR of 3.0 is variably estimated to be $5000 to $15,000 US dollars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reversal-of-anticoagulation-in-warfarin-associated-intracerebral-hemorrhage/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Supplementation of three-factor PCC with low doses of rFVIIa to provide a source of factor VII has been reported.
