Measles has been targeted for eradication given the favorable biologic characteristic that humans are the only reservoir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; however, due to social and political factors and high transmissibility, elimination has been achieved in very few areas of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology and transmission of measles will be reviewed here.

Control efforts have substantially altered the global distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Measles incidence has decreased substantially in regions where vaccination has been instituted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58949\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58949 \">figure 1</a>); measles occurs predominantly in areas with low vaccination rates, particularly in the developing world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>During the prevaccine era, more than 90 percent of children acquired measles by age 15 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Following implementation of routine childhood vaccination in the United States at age 12 to 15 months, the age of peak measles incidence during epidemics in the United States shifted to &lt;12 months. This susceptibility approximates the time at which transplacentally acquired maternal antibodies are no longer present if the mother has vaccine-induced immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>Worldwide, measles is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Precise incidence estimates are difficult to obtain because of heterogeneous surveillance systems and probable underreporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Before the introduction of the measles vaccine, over two million deaths occurred annually, the majority in children &lt;5 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Availability of measles vaccination beginning in the 1960s immediately impacted disease incidence and mortality rates. Vaccination rates vary worldwide; in 2013, there were an estimated 145,700 deaths reported, predominantly in the developing world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3175833121\"><span class=\"h2\">Individuals at risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals at risk for measles include children too young to be vaccinated, those who have not been vaccinated for medical or other reasons, those who have not received a second dose of measles vaccine, and those for whom the vaccine failed to elicit a protective immune response (a very small fraction of those immunized with two doses of vaccine).</p><p>Travel to areas where measles is endemic or contact with ill persons arriving from these countries increases the risk of exposure to measles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2196532\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measles is highly contagious; the attack rate in a susceptible individual exposed to measles is 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Transmission occurs via person-to-person contact as well as airborne spread. Infectious droplets from the respiratory secretions of a patient with measles can remain airborne for up to two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Therefore, the illness may be transmitted in public spaces, even in the absence of person-to-person contact. Measles transmission between airplane passengers in airports and during flight has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], and large outbreaks can occur in areas of crowding such as schools and densely populated communities.</p><p>The incubation period for measles is 6 to 19 days (median 13 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Subclinical illness is unusual. The period of contagiousness is estimated to be from five days before the appearance of rash to four days afterward. The period of maximum contagiousness is thought to be during the late prodrome phase, when the patient is febrile and has respiratory symptoms. Patients with measles-associated subacute sclerosing panencephalitis are not contagious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In temperate areas, the peak incidence of measles occurs in the late winter and early spring.

Immunity due to measles vaccination is also highly protective against clinical infection. During an outbreak in the Netherlands, for example, unvaccinated individuals were 224 times more likely to become infected compared with vaccinated individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Children of mothers vaccinated against measles have lower concentrations of transplacentally acquired maternal antibodies to measles (and therefore lose protection afforded by maternal antibodies at an earlier age) than children born to mothers with immunity acquired from natural infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/15,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,29-31</a>]. As a result, measles occurs more commonly among children &lt;12 months in countries with high measles vaccine coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/6,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,32</a>]. </p><p>In developing countries, a younger age of measles infection has been noted among children born to HIV-infected mothers than children born to HIV-uninfected mothers.

A surge in cases was noted in 2008, but dramatic declines were noted after this and, as of mid-2009, 24 of the 37 countries and areas that comprise the Region were thought to have eliminated or nearly eliminated measles. The Republic of Korea declared measles eliminated in 2006. The majority of measles cases occurred in China in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. An outbreak occurred in Japan from 2007 to 2008, which led to secondary imported cases in Canada and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. In addition, an epidemic in the Philippines in 2014 increased cases in the region along with outbreaks in Vietnam and continued increases in the number of cases in China. Despite this, the region has a two-dose measles vaccine coverage rate of just above 90 percent. The Region had over 78,000 measles cases in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/41,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H534271701\"><span class=\"h2\">Eastern Mediterranean Region</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WHO-designated Eastern Mediterranean Region set a goal of measles elimination by 2010 in 1997; this has not been achieved. Implementing measles control has been a challenge in some areas, in part due to civil unrest, natural disasters, and inadequate public health systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/40,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,75</a>]. Overall measles cases have declined; in the early 1980s, there were approximately 200,000 cases identified annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], but, in 2013, 20,885 cases were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Measles-related deaths are estimated to have fallen by 49 percent from 2000 to 2013, with resurgence in cases noted starting in 2008 mainly because of large outbreaks in several countries with conflicts and insecurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In 2012, of the 23 member countries, administration of the primary dose of measles immunization was recommended at 9 months of age in 12 countries (52 percent) and at 12 to 15 months in 11 countries (48 percent). Twenty countries (87 percent) had measles vaccination schedules with at least two doses and overall coverage hovering around 83 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H534271718\"><span class=\"h2\">Southeast Asia Region</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WHO-designated Southeast Asia Region improved measles vaccine coverage between 2000 to 2013 by 24 percent; 78 percent of member states offered two doses of vaccine which was associated with a 63 percent reduction in measles deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This Region had approximately 31,000 measles deaths in 2013, representing the second highest mortality rate globally (26 percent). This Region includes India, identified as the only WHO-designated &quot;priority country&quot; that has not implemented the WHO measles control strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/6,40,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,40,77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

It has been targeted for eradication given the favorable biologic characteristic that humans are the only reservoir. However, due to social and political factors and high transmissibility, elimination has been achieved in very few areas of the world. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the prevaccine era, &ge;90 percent of children acquired measles by age 15. Following implementation of routine childhood vaccination at age 12 to 15 months, the age of peak measles incidence during epidemics in the United States shifted to less than 12 months. This is the time at which transplacentally acquired maternal antibodies are no longer protective in the child if the mother has vaccine-induced immunity. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measles is highly contagious; the attack rate in a susceptible individual exposed to measles is 90 percent. The period of contagiousness is estimated to be from five days before the appearance of rash to four days afterward. Infectious droplets from the respiratory secretions of a patient with measles can remain airborne for up to two hours. Therefore, the illness may be transmitted in public spaces, even in the absence of person-to-person contact. (See <a href=\"#H2196532\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals at risk for measles include children too young to be vaccinated, those who have not been vaccinated for medical or other reasons, those who have not received a second dose of measles vaccine, and those for whom the vaccine failed to elicit a protective immune response (a very small fraction of those immunized). Travel to areas where measles is endemic or contact with ill persons arriving from these countries increases the risk of exposure to measles. (See <a href=\"#H3175833121\" class=\"local\">'Individuals at risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The live attenuated measles vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1967; since that time, the number of cases has fallen by approximately 99 percent. Measles is no longer considered an endemic disease in the United States, although isolated outbreaks due to measles importation continue to occur. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'United States'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H619314475\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Jorge Barinaga, MD, MS, and Paul Skolnik, MD, FACP, FIDSA, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measles-epidemiology-and-transmission/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Moss WJ.
