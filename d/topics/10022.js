It may arise from a variety of genetic, structural, metabolic, immune, and infectious causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91410 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Seizures and epilepsy are generally divided into focal and generalized according to the mode of seizure onset as well as into genetic, structural, metabolic, immune, infectious, or unknown according to the underlying cause or etiology. Focal or localization-related epilepsies have previously been referred to as partial epilepsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Most of the focal epilepsies are either structural or unknown, which means there is a presumed focal structural cause that cannot be identified historically or be seen with current imaging techniques. If the patient undergoes epilepsy surgery, the cause is sometimes subsequently defined pathologically. Focal epilepsies of childhood, including benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes and Panayiotopoulos syndrome, are of unknown cause but may have a genetic component.</p><p>The causes, clinical manifestations, and electroencephalographic features of the localization-related epilepsies are reviewed here. The focal epilepsies of childhood and those that occur exclusively or predominantly during sleep are discussed in detail separately.

These cases represent most cases of adult-onset epilepsy, although these are common in childhood as well. If imaging studies are normal, the cause remains unknown. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hippocampal sclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hippocampal sclerosis (HS, also called mesial temporal sclerosis) is the most common pathological feature of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pathologic examination reveals neuronal loss in the hippocampus, predominantly involving the hilar region, CA1, CA3, CA4, and dentate gyrus, with relative sparing of the CA2 region. A classification scheme developed by a task force of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) recognizes three pathological subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HS ILAE type 1 is characterized by severe neuronal loss and gliosis predominantly involving CA1 and CA4. The CA1 segment is the most severely affected, with &gt;80 percent cell loss, but all other segments also show significant neuronal cell loss. Approximately 60 to 80 percent of surgically resected specimens fall into this subtype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HS ILAE type 2 is characterized by CA1-predominant neuronal cell loss and gliosis with sparing of cell numbers in CA2, CA3 and CA4.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HS ILAE type 3 is characterized by CA4-predominant cell loss (&gt;50 percent) with sparing of other regions.</p><p/><p>It is typical for HS pathology to be bilateral, although one side is usually more predominantly involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Reorganization of neuronal networks in response to cell loss is likely to contribute significantly to epileptogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of HS is not completely understood. While birth and developmental histories are usually normal, a history of febrile seizures in early childhood is common. A long duration of febrile seizures, in particular, appears to be associated with the an increased risk of TLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In some patients and families, genetic factors appear to influence both the development of febrile seizures and the later development of TLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A link between human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) and HS has also been posited based on association studies as well as examination of epileptogenic tissue samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-febrile-seizures#H750680606\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of febrile seizures&quot;, section on 'Subsequent temporal lobe epilepsy'</a>.)</p><p>Some neuroimaging studies suggest that neurodevelopmental factors may contribute to the development of both febrile seizures and TLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the smaller subset of patients with mesial TLE who first present as adults, it is possible that an autoimmune limbic encephalitis may be the underlying pathogenesis in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Accumulating evidence from advanced neuroimaging studies suggest that the neurologic abnormalities in patients with HS extend beyond the temporal lobe and can involve both gray and white matter structures on the contralateral as well as ipsilateral side as well as the cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. Some studies have correlated the degree of extrahippocampal abnormalities with neuropsychiatric deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other structural causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of additional structural pathologies can be identified with modern neuroimaging techniques. Known causes of localization-related epilepsy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perinatal injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortical dysplasias (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in children: Classification, etiology, and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Neurodevelopmental lesions'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neoplasms (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular malformations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head trauma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-traumatic seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke (cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Poststroke seizures'</a>)</p><p/><p>The neuroanatomic locus of seizure origin and demographic features can vary with the underlying etiology. As examples, cerebrovascular disease and neoplasms generally present in later life, while epilepsy resulting from perinatal injury presents in infancy or early childhood. Epilepsy associated with cortical dysplasias presents at a mean age of 7 years (range &lt;1 to 26 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Post-traumatic epilepsy has a peak incidence in early adulthood and most commonly arises from the frontal and temporal lobes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-traumatic-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-traumatic seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic focal epilepsy syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several epilepsy syndromes involving focal epilepsy primarily arising from the frontal or temporal lobes. The majority of these syndromes are familial, although sporadic cases are also described.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), also called sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE), is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome manifesting in childhood or adolescence with clusters of brief nocturnal seizures arising in non-rapid eye movement sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/28-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-35</a>]. Structural and unknown etiologies of SHE also exist, and seizures sometimes localize to the temporal lobe or other areas. Cognition and other neurologic functions are usually normal, and interictal electroencephalogram (EEG) is often normal. The course is usually benign with easily controlled seizures; however, one-third will develop drug resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-epilepsy-syndromes#H2948959093\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related epilepsy syndromes&quot;, section on 'Nocturnal (sleep-related) focal epilepsies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autosomal dominant epilepsy with auditory features, also called familial lateral temporal lobe epilepsy, is a genetically heterogeneous syndrome, associated with prominent auditory hallucinations and focal seizures that evolve into bilateral convulsive seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/32,36-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36-47</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually normal as is the interictal EEG. Seizures are easily controlled in most cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of familial temporal lobe epilepsies have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/32,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,48-50</a>]. In general, these are autosomal-dominantly inherited but are otherwise genetically heterogeneous. They are variably associated with antecedent febrile seizures and hippocampal sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. The prognosis also varies between disorders; in general, those with hippocampal sclerosis are more likely to have refractory seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p/><p>The genetic basis of these syndromes is increasingly understood and appears to overlap significantly with that of cortical dysplasia and other neurodevelopmental lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-children-classification-etiology-and-clinical-features#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in children: Classification, etiology, and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Neurodevelopmental lesions'</a>.)</p><p>The most commonly involved pathway described to date is the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. Causative mutations in <em>DEPDC5</em>, <em>NPRL2</em>, and <em>NPRL3</em>, which encode three subunits of the GATOR1 complex that regulates mTORC1 signalling, have been identified in multiple patients and families with focal epilepsy, often with overlapping phenotypes and in some cases in association with brain malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>]. Among these, <em>DEPDC5</em> mutations appear to be the most common, accounting for approximately 10 percent of familial focal epilepsy cases in various cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/57,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,59,60</a>]. Additional genetic causes of focal epilepsy include mutations in <em>CHRNA2</em>, <em>CHRNA4</em>, <em>CHRNB2</em>, <em>KCNT1</em>, and <em>LGI1</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>].</p><p>The role of genetic testing in most patients with epilepsy is not yet established, and testing is often expensive. The clinical utility of extensive testing remains relatively limited except in children with severe epileptic encephalopathy; in such cases, when a causative mutation is identified, the etiology is understood and further testing may be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].

In the absence of other neurologic abnormalities or a family history, such cases are considered to be of unknown cause (previously referred to as cryptogenic). In many patients with normal MRI who undergo epilepsy surgery, focal pathologies such as dysplastic lesions, microgyria, and gliosis are identified histopathologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Localization-related epilepsies are usually divided into mesiotemporal and neocortical based on electroclinical semiology.

Most cases of TLE can be further localized to the mesial temporal lobe (hippocampus, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus).</p><p>Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is the most common underlying cause of mesial TLE and the most common pathologic finding in patients undergoing surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Central nervous system (CNS) infection (eg, encephalitis), head trauma, hamartomas, glial tumors, limbic encephalitis, vascular and congenital malformations, and perinatal injury are other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/16,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,67</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hippocampal sclerosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Other structural causes'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5031012\"><span class=\"h3\">Seizure semiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or awareness (previously referred to as complex partial seizures) are the most common manifestation of mesial TLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. About one-third of patients also have focal seizures evolving to bilateral convulsive seizures (also referred to as secondary generalized seizures). Only a few patients with mesial TLE develop status epilepticus. Distinctive characteristics of mesial TLE seizures include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An &quot;aura&quot; (a focal seizure with sensory or psychic symptoms) occurs in most patients. Common features include a rising epigastric sensation (often likened to a &quot;roller coaster&quot; sensation), and psychic or experiential phenomena, such as deja vu, jamais vu, or fear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F111954\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111954 \">table 2</a>). Auras of taste (gustatory hallucinations) and smell (olfactory hallucinations) are less common. Auras can occur in isolation or can precede a focal seizure with impairment of consciousness or awareness. In either case, patients with mesial TLE usually recall the seizure aura.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal seizures with impairment of consciousness or awareness (also called focal dyscognitive or complex partial seizures) usually manifest with a behavioral arrest and staring and last between 30 and 120 seconds. The patients are generally unaware and unresponsive during this period. Occasionally, such patients present with amnestic attacks, but more detailed questioning or observation of the seizures reveal the presence of olfactory hallucinations, other seizure auras, or ictal automatisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Automatisms are common, occurring in about 60 percent of focal seizures with impairment of consciousness in patients with mesial TLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/8,69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,69,70</a>]. These are repetitive, stereotyped, purposeless movements. In TLE, they are typically mild, involving the hands (picking, fidgeting, fumbling) and mouth (chewing, lip smacking).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateralizing features can occur during or after a focal seizure. Unilateral automatisms are usually ipsilateral to the seizure focus, while dystonic posturing almost invariably occurs on the contralateral side. Head deviation at seizure onset is usually ipsilateral to the seizure; when it occurs later, it is contralateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. This later head turning also has a more forceful, involuntary appearance and is so-characterized as &quot;versive.&quot; Contralateral clonic activity is relatively unusual. Lateralizing findings in the setting of mesial temporal sclerosis should be interpreted with some caution, as many of these patients have bilateral, independent seizure foci.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less commonly observed behaviors associated with a temporal lobe seizure include ictal speech and vocalizations, affective behaviors (laughing, crying or fear), hypermotor behaviors usually associated with frontal lobe seizures, and so-called &quot;leaving behavior&quot; (walking or running away) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/72-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-75</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postictal confusion usually resolves within minutes. If postictal psychosis occurs, it typically lasts for days to weeks and often does not begin immediately after the seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Postictal hemiparesis can occur contralateral to the seizure focus, and postictal aphasia can occur with a seizure emanating from the dominant hemisphere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults#H1618254736\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;, section on 'Postictal period'</a>). Nose-wiping, performed by the hand ipsilateral to the focus of seizure onset, is a common postictal event in mesial TLE. Postictal wandering is not specific to TLE, but is seen more often with temporal compared to extratemporal seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart rate changes commonly accompany temporal lobe seizures. In one report, abrupt tachycardia was present in the majority of both right and left-sided mesial temporal lobe seizures (29 out of 29 right-sided seizures and 42 out of 48 left-sided seizures), but the onset of tachycardia in relation to the ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) onset was earlier in right-sided seizures, often preceding the ictus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. One potential explanation is that the delayed heart rate increase associated with left mesial temporal lobe seizures results from seizure propagation to the right temporal lobe. Although some reports have noted that tachycardia is more typical of seizures originating from the right mesial temporal lobe and bradycardia is more common with left-sided seizures, most have not found this to be a useful lateralizing feature. Ictal bradycardia is much less common than tachycardia and in at least one study was associated with bilateral temporal lobe seizure activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1024829397\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuropsychiatric symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association between mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and neuropsychiatric symptoms is somewhat controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/8,81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,81,82</a>]. Associated impairments of memory and cognition are often reported, but these may also result from frequent seizures and medication side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].

Seizure manifestations generally reflect the area of cortex involved, which is not necessarily the site of origin of the seizure. As an example, among four patients with supplementary motor area (SMA) seizures undergoing epilepsy surgery, only one had an epileptic focus in the SMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Seizures arising from the orbitofrontal cortex that secondarily involve the adjacent mesial temporal lobe can be indistinguishable from mesial TLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/66,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,106</a>].</p><p>Common characteristics of frontal lobe seizures are short duration (&lt;30 seconds) and predilection for occurrence during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/34,66,108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,66,108,109</a>].

Hemiclonic activity is more common in complex partial seizures of frontal origin than with those in TLE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supplementary motor area seizures typically produce stereotyped asymmetric tonic movements. One example is the &quot;fencing posture,&quot; in which the head and eye deviate to the contralateral side, with extension of the contralateral arm and flexion of the ipsilateral arm. The most prominent tonic activity occurs contralateral to the seizure focus. Brief superimposed clonic movements or vocalizations may also occur. Speech arrest may accompany seizures arising from the dominant hemisphere. There may be a somatosensory aura. Despite bilateral tonic movements, consciousness is often preserved unless there is secondary generalization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>So-called frontal absence seizures manifest with staring, trance-like states.

The yield of abnormal findings increases with repeated and prolonged monitoring.</p><p>Ictal EEG patterns can include voltage attenuation, electrodecremental response, rhythmic alpha or theta activity, and spike or spike and wave discharges. Up to one-third of patients do not have a diagnostic ictal EEG during a frontal lobe seizure. Large areas of the frontal lobe are inaccessible to surface EEG or can be obscured by prominent motor activity. The use of transverse montages may be helpful to record seizure activity over the vertex. Another problem is that rapid spread of the seizure can lead to false localization and even lateralization of the seizure focus. In some cases, rapid spread of frontal discharges mimics primary generalized spike-wave complexes. This is referred to as &quot;secondary bilateral synchrony,&quot; with interictal epileptiform discharges that appear to be primarily generalized but are actually secondarily generalized focal discharges. Frontal lobe absences are associated with an irregular spike-wave pattern.</p><p>Because of these challenges, additional functional and metabolic imaging and invasive EEG monitoring may be required in patients undergoing surgical evaluation in order to adequately localize frontal seizures, particularly when structural MR imaging is normal.

Patients have facial angioma, cortical atrophy, gyriform calcifications, and contralateral hemiparesis and hemianopia. Focal seizures evolving to bilateral convulsive seizures are the most common seizure type. On EEG, in addition to epileptiform discharges and slowing on the side of the angiomatosis, low-amplitude or absent background may be seen.

This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electroencephalography (EEG) in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-in-the-evaluation-of-seizures-and-epilepsy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging in the evaluation of seizures and epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Semiologic seizure classification attempts to associate clinical features of the seizures with the neuroanatomic focus of seizure origin. However, localization based on either clinical or EEG features alone is often inaccurate. This may be because seizures arise from a part of the brain that is either clinically silent or inaccessible to scalp EEG recordings. Also, seizure activity often spreads quickly from one brain region to another and obscures the original focus of seizure origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. As a result, clinical symptoms and EEG activity may reflect regional brain involvement, but not necessarily the primary neuroanatomic site of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/133-136\" class=\"abstract_t\">133-136</a>].</p><p>Similarly, it is not always possible to distinguish focal from primary generalized seizures on clinical and historical information alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. A seizure aura suggests a focal onset. While patients with generalized seizures sometimes report nonspecific symptoms that may suggest a seizure aura, highly specific sensory symptoms, such as olfactory auras, are highly diagnostic of focal epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/138\" class=\"abstract_t\">138</a>]. In one series, both aura and longer seizure duration suggested focal seizures, while ictal eye blinking and higher seizure frequency suggested primary generalized epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. No clinical feature was absolute.</p><p>The interictal EEG may be normal in patients with focal epilepsy. When abnormal, it shows focal spikes or sharp waves. The ictal EEG (if recorded) usually shows a focal or regional discharge at onset. With a normal interictal EEG, the diagnosis of focal epilepsy is based on clinical symptoms. While EEG is an important diagnostic test in evaluating a patient with possible epilepsy, there are several reasons why EEG alone cannot be used to make or refute a specific diagnosis of epilepsy. This topic is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electroencephalography (EEG) in the diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1024829052\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of focal seizures can be difficult to distinguish from nonepileptic paroxysmal conditions, including movement disorders, migraine, sleep disorders, and psychiatric conditions. In our experience, the misdiagnosis of seizures is common. Up to one-third of patients seen at epilepsy centers for difficult &quot;seizures&quot; have been misdiagnosed, sometimes because of over-interpretation of benign EEG variants as abnormal. The most common conditions misdiagnosed as seizures are psychogenic nonepileptic seizures and syncope. Prolonged EEG monitoring can be useful when the diagnosis is uncertain.

Febrile seizures, particularly prolonged and complex febrile seizures, are a risk factor for hippocampal sclerosis. TLE associated with hippocampal sclerosis typically presents in childhood or early adolescence. While initially responsive to antiseizure drug treatment in most cases, seizures can become medically intractable.
