The supranuclear disorders of gaze in children are reviewed here. Palsy of isolated extraocular muscles is discussed separately.

Gaze palsies are caused by malfunction of one of the &quot;gaze centers&quot; (cortical and brainstem regions responsible for conjugate gaze) or by interruption of the pathways leading from them.</p><p>A gaze palsy that is caused by a lesion in the brainstem gaze center is called a nuclear gaze palsy, whereas one caused by a lesion in the cortical gaze center is called a supranuclear gaze palsy. The patient with supranuclear palsy is unable to move both eyes past the midline in one direction, and the eyes usually are held fixed and turned toward the opposite side by the opposing extraocular muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DISTURBANCES OF HORIZONTAL GAZE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signal for horizontal gaze originates in the contralateral frontal lobe for fast eye movements (saccades) and in the ipsilateral parieto-occipito-temporal region for smooth pursuit. The supranuclear pathway extends to the ipsilateral sixth nerve (abducens) nucleus. The final common pathway for horizontal gaze consists of the pontine reticular formation (PPRF) and the sixth nerve nucleus. The sixth nerve nucleus receives supranuclear and vestibular input to initiate horizontal eye movements.</p><p>The sixth nerve nucleus contains two types of neurons: motor neurons and internuclear neurons. The axons of the internuclear neurons cross to the contralateral side in the lower pons and, after ascending in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), synapse in the portion of the third nerve (oculomotor) subnucleus that innervates the medial rectus muscle. Thus, horizontal gaze involves synchronous activation of the lateral rectus muscle of one eye and the medial rectus muscle of the other, via the MLF. This final common pathway for horizontal gaze is controlled by the vestibular, optokinetic, smooth pursuit, and saccadic systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>].</p><p>A lesion anywhere along the supranuclear or nuclear pathways that control horizontal eye movements can cause a horizontal gaze palsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52250\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52250 \">table 2</a>). Horizontal pursuit, saccades, or both may be impaired depending upon the location of the lesion. A horizontal gaze palsy to the ipsilateral side occurs in pontine lesions affecting the abducens nucleus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the PPRF. Lesions of the MLF result in internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), whereas lesions of the MLF plus the ipsilateral abducens nucleus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PPRF result in the one-and-a-half syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Horizontal gaze palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with horizontal gaze palsy typically is unable to move either eye beyond the midline in one direction. The eyes are deviated constantly to the opposite side, and the patient must turn his or her head toward the side with the gaze palsy to fixate on an object that is directly in front of him or her. Horizontal gaze palsy usually is caused by a contralateral frontal or ipsilateral pontine lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52250\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52250 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Frontal lobe lesions may impair ipsilateral horizontal smooth pursuit, and lesions of the posterior parietal cortex or parieto-occipito-temporal region decrease the amplitude and velocity of smooth-pursuit eye movements toward the side of the lesion.</p><p>In patients with pontine lesions involving the PPRF or sixth nerve nucleus, the eyes may be deviated away from the side of the lesion. Thus, patients who are unable to move either eye beyond the midline to the left may have a left pontine lesion, and the eyes are deviated to the right. The patient may have partial horizontal gaze movement if the damage to the pontine structures is only partial.</p><p>At the bedside, pontine lesions usually can be differentiated from supranuclear lesions in the frontal lobe by associated neurologic findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52250\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52250 \">table 2</a>). The oculocephalic or doll's eye maneuver is helpful. Passive horizontal rotation of the head directly stimulates the sixth nerve nucleus via the vestibuloocular reflex and will overcome gaze palsies induced by frontal lobe lesions but will not overcome gaze palsies caused by pontine nuclear and infranuclear lesions.</p><p>Horizontal gaze palsies are caused by ischemia and infarction, hemorrhage, vascular malformations, tumors, demyelination, trauma, or infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/1,2,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7-9</a>]. Neuroimaging studies should be performed with attention given to the dorsal pons. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) usually is the procedure of choice. However, computed tomography (CT) is an acceptable alternative in the acute setting, in patients with altered levels of consciousness, or in patients in whom MRI is contraindicated (eg, patients with pacemakers). An electroencephalogram (EEG) is indicated to exclude a seizure disorder in patients with clinical seizure activity or intermittent conjugate gaze deviation, or in obtunded or comatose patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Internuclear ophthalmoplegia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO, medial longitudinal fasciculus syndrome) is caused by lesions located in the MLF between the sixth nerve nucleus and the contralateral third nerve nucleus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62010\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62010 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/3-6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6,10</a>]. Such lesions permit the horizontal gaze center to communicate with the sixth nerve nucleus but not the contralateral third nerve nucleus.</p><p>INO is characterized by adduction weakness on the side of the MLF lesion and nystagmus in the opposite eye (the abducting eye in attempted horizontal gaze) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53437\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53437 \">figure 2</a>). Nystagmus may be the most prominent finding in subtle cases. When INO is present bilaterally, it usually is coupled with vertical nystagmus on upward gaze. Convergence (ie, both eyes turning in, necessary for near fixation) usually is preserved because the third nerve and medial rectus muscle continue to function normally in situations that do not require conjugate eye movements. However, convergence may be affected if the responsible lesion is high in the midbrain.</p><p>INO can be caused by a demyelinating process, such as multiple sclerosis, inflammation, ischemia, neoplasm, or trauma. It also can occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome and in Wernicke syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Myasthenia gravis and a partial third nerve palsy involving the medial rectus muscle both can be mistaken for INO. Patients with ptosis, variability, or fatigue should be evaluated for myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Ptosis, pupil involvement, involvement of other extraocular muscles, and absence of nystagmus in the abducting eye should suggest the diagnosis of third nerve palsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MRI is the method of choice for diagnosis of INO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. T2-weighted images may show abnormal high-signal intensity in the mid pons corresponding to the right medial longitudinal fasciculus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">One-and-a-half syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with the one-and-a-half syndrome have horizontal gaze palsy when looking to one side (the &quot;one&quot;) and impaired adduction (INO) when looking to the other (the &quot;and-a-half&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients with this syndrome often also have exotropia (turning out) of the eye opposite the side of the lesion (paralytic pontine exotropia).</p><p>The one-and-a-half syndrome is caused by a unilateral lesion of the dorsal pontine tegmentum, involving the ipsilateral PPRF, internuclear fibers of the ipsilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus, and, usually, the abducens nucleus. MRI typically reveals an infarct in the pons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Stroke and multiple sclerosis are the main causes of this rare syndrome, but it can be caused by any structural lesion in the dorsal pons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DISTURBANCES OF VERTICAL GAZE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frontal lobes (for saccades), the parietooccipital lobes (for pursuit), and their connections to the brainstem constitute the supranuclear pathway for vertical gaze. The presumed vertical gaze center in the rostral midbrain includes the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC). The ocular motor neurons concerned with vertical gaze and torsional eye movements originate in the oculomotor and trochlear nuclei, and the third and fourth cranial nerve nuclei, respectively. These nuclei receive afferents from the vestibular, smooth-pursuit, optokinetic, and saccadic systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Vertical gaze palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A lesion located anywhere along the supranuclear or nuclear pathways that control vertical eye movements can cause a vertical gaze palsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68257\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68257 \">table 3</a>). Paralysis of upward vertical gaze is the most common vertical gaze palsy, followed by paralysis of both upward and downward gaze, and finally paralysis of downward gaze alone.</p><p>A patient with paralysis of upward gaze can move the eyes together in all directions, except above the midline. The head usually is tilted backward. The individual may have partial movement of the eyes if the paralysis is incomplete.</p><p>Multiple conditions, including midbrain strokes, pineal and metastatic tumors, vascular malformations, hydrocephalus (including shunt failure), inflammation, infection, and demyelinating disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, are associated with vertical gaze abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In addition, numerous metabolic disorders, including Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome (abetalipoproteinemia), Niemann-Pick C disease, Tay-Sachs disease, Gaucher disease, maple syrup urine disease, hyperglycinuria, hexosaminidase A deficiency, Wilson disease, kernicterus, and Wernicke syndrome can produce vertical gaze palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See appropriate topic reviews).</p><p>Myasthenia gravis can mimic a vertical gaze paresis and ptosis; symptoms of variability or fatigue should prompt an evaluation for myasthenia gravis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of a generalized metabolic or degenerative process, MRI with attention given to the mesencephalon, thalamus, and ventricular system is required in patients with vertical gaze palsy. A lumbar puncture should be performed to look for infectious etiologies if MRI is normal and signs suggestive of meningeal irritation are present, or if MRI with contrast reveals diffuse meningeal enhancement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Parinaud syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The constellation of neuroophthalmologic findings seen with pretectal lesions (including abnormalities of vertical gaze and convergence) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81227\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81227 \">table 4</a>) has been variously called Parinaud syndrome, the Sylvian aqueduct syndrome, the pretectal syndrome, the dorsal midbrain syndrome, and the Koerber-Salus-Elschnig syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58178\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58178 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. </p><p>In one study of 206 patients, abnormal pupils were found in 198 patients, vertical gaze limitation in 180, disjunctive horizontal eye position in 90, disjunctive vertical eye position in 79, lid retraction in 83, and convergence-retraction nystagmus in 71 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The etiology was hydrocephalus in 80 patients, stroke in 53, and tumor in 45. The development of a dorsal midbrain syndrome in a patient with shunted hydrocephalus typically indicates dysfunction of the shunt, and revision of the shunt should be considered even if neuroimaging is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis#H1293171877\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocephalus in children: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Shunt malfunction'</a>.)</p><p>Bilateral light near dissociation (seen in Parinaud syndrome), in which the pupils constrict poorly to light but react to accommodation (near response), distinguishes lid retraction related to Parinaud syndrome (Collier sign) from lid-retraction related to thyroid disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Skew deviation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;skew deviation&quot; is reserved for vertical misalignment resulting from supranuclear derangements in the posterior fossa. These lesions disrupt the vestibuloocular connections and may be constant or transient. Otolith inputs to the INC from the contralateral vestibular nuclei, and motor outputs from the INC to cervical and ocular motor neurons, probably are involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Stimulation of the semicircular canal can produce skew deviation in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Skew deviation consists of downward and inward rotation of the eye on the side of the lesion and upward and outward rotation of the eye on the opposite side. Patients typically manifest other posterior fossa signs (eg, other cranial neuropathies, hemisensory loss, or hemiparesis). In some patients, skew deviation may be associated with ocular torsion and head tilt (a triad of findings known as the ocular tilt reaction). The head tilt represents a compensatory response to the perceived tilt of the subjective visual vertical.</p><p>The vertical separation can be tested by placing a red lens over one eye, shining a white point-light at the patient, and asking the patient to note the relative position of the red spot to the white spot. The light should be moved from side to side to see how the separation changes with lateral and vertical gaze. Skew deviation often is &quot;comitant&quot;, meaning that gaze direction has little effect upon the distance between the images. When it is incomitant, it needs to be differentiated from other problems, such as fourth cranial nerve palsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) palsy&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Skew deviation can accompany lesions in different areas of the brainstem (mesencephalon to medulla) or cerebellum. It usually is caused by acute hydrocephalus, tumors, strokes, and multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Superior and inferior oblique palsy also can present with downward deviation, cyclotorsion, and head tilt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/28,29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,31</a>]. However, in patients with skew deviation, the direction of torsion usually is inconsistent with that of superior or inferior oblique palsy, and additional posterior fossa signs typically are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. In addition, cyclotorsion and vertical misalignment are position dependent in skew deviation (decreasing with position change from upright to supine), whereas they are relatively unaffected by position change in superior oblique palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. A positive upright-supine test (vertical strabismus decreases by &ge;50 percent with position change from upright to supine) is highly specific (100 percent) and sensitive (80 percent) for skew deviation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with supranuclear gaze palsy are unable to move both eyes past the midline in one direction.
