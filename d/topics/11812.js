Diagnostic strategies for these infections are similar to those used for patients without renal failure. However, a higher index of suspicion and a lower threshold for the initiation of a search are appropriate since patients with ESRD are frequently diabetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunosuppressed because of the retention of uremic toxins. Careful attention to appropriate dosing of antibiotics and the avoidance (if possible) of nephrotoxic drugs in the patient with residual renal function are also significant issues.</p><p>Many of the infections reviewed in this topic are not unique to the dialysis patient. As a result, although the likelihood of their occurrence may be increased, special considerations and guidelines for the dialysis patient are not available. Diagnostic and treatment strategies must be tailored to the individual patient, including the consequences of kidney failure and other comorbid conditions, the geographic location, and specific environmental exposures.</p><p>A review of the clinical characteristics of infections not related to the dialysis access is presented here. Reviews of access-related infections and the clinical manifestations and treatment of sepsis in dialysis patients, a complication most commonly due to infection of dialysis access devices, are discussed separately.

In addition, a prospective study evaluating the outcome of 65 episodes of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> bacteremia in hemodialysis patients (89 percent of which were due to an access) found that metastatic complications and death occurred in 44 and 14 percent of patients, respectively. In contrast, other studies suggest that non-access-related infections are less common and not as devastating, accounting for an overall mortality rate of less than 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-access-related-infections-in-chronic-dialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Older dialysis patients may be at higher risk for acquiring infection caused by drug-resistant organisms and for death resulting from infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-access-related-infections-in-chronic-dialysis-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In one retrospective, observational study of dialysis patients, the probability of being hospitalized from pneumonia was 9 and 36 percent at one and five years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-access-related-infections-in-chronic-dialysis-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A more recent observational study found a pneumonia incidence rate of 21.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">events/100</span> patient-years, with 90.1 percent requiring hospitalization, and a 30-day fatality of 10.7 percent in Medicare patients on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-access-related-infections-in-chronic-dialysis-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Nevertheless, the presence of a productive cough, fever, chills, pleuritic pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dyspnea suggest an infectious pulmonary process. The diagnosis may be confirmed by sputum evaluation and chest radiograph. Treatment should not be withheld if a high index of suspicion remains, despite the absence of diagnostic test results.

However, peritonitis resulting from enteric bacteria is frequently caused by injury to gastrointestinal viscera and may have devastating consequences. Peritonitis acquired by virtue of microscopic perforation may be insidious, with subtle or no radiographic abnormalities despite evolving clinical symptoms. In a review of 230 peritoneal dialysis patients followed over eight years, approximately 30 percent of peritonitis episodes resulting from enteric organisms were due to documented visceral leakage, including cholecystitis, ischemic bowel disease, viscus perforation, or diverticulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-access-related-infections-in-chronic-dialysis-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

An important issue in the dialysis patient with significant gastrointestinal fluid loss (by vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea) is the accurate assessment of intravascular volume to avoid a substantial decrease in the effective circulating volume with dialysis therapy. Careful attention must therefore be given to variations in blood pressure during the procedure and the accurate determination of dry weight.

Eight of nine patients with significant pyuria and 10 of 11 patients without significant pyuria grew one or more pathogens considered clinically significant.
