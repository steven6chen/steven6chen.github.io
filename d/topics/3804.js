Other illnesses also have a propensity for causing inflammation of joints and the gut.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of arthritis associated with IBD are presented here. Other disorders associated with both gastrointestinal disease and joint involvement are discussed here briefly, particularly in the context of the differential diagnosis of patients with these symptoms and findings. The treatment of IBD-associated arthritis; and the pathogenesis, other clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, are reviewed in detail separately.

A disturbance of the gut barrier is postulated as the first and primary process for most of these proposed mechanisms. An alternative suggestion is that shared genetic or environmental factors predispose individuals to various organ manifestations of these inflammatory conditions, such as gut or joint involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, there may be a role for translocation of pathogens, as occurs in parasitic rheumatism, in which case effective antihelminthic treatment resolves the arthritis. There may also be circulating microbial elements, as proposed for post-<em>Yersinia</em> reactive arthritis, in which case the pathogen cannot be cultured from the synovial fluid.</p><p>Both human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and non-HLA genes have been associated with different articular phenotypes, with an increase in HLA-B27 in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">spondylitis/sacroiliitis</span> (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> below). Molecular mimicry, in which an immune response to a gut-derived antigen cross-reacts with normal host protein, has been invoked to explain the role of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 in post-dysenteric reactive arthritis, but this mechanism has proved difficult to confirm definitively in either the clinical setting or in experimental models of colitis. Circulating immune complexes, initiated by an immune response to gut microbes, have been implicated in the arthritis following intestinal bypass surgery.</p><p>The concept of distinctive trafficking of gut-derived immunocompetent cells has been supported by studies of the integrins which direct the homing patterns of circulating lymphocytes. Cells such as mucosa-associated invariant T cells (MAITS) can be recovered from the synovial fluid of patients with ankylosing spondylitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Integrins, such as alpha4-beta7 integrin, are thought to have a role in mediating trafficking of lymphocytes to gut and joint tissues.</p><p>Observations showing that a majority of patients with SpA exhibit subclinical gut inflammation indicate an even closer link between IBD and SpA than that suggested by the association between clinically manifest IBD and SpA manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3419338345\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> below). A detailed overview of the pathogenesis of SpA is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3419338345\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulcerative colitis and regional enteritis (Crohn disease) are the most frequently encountered types of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with arthritis or spondylitis. In a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis of the available studies of the prevalence of axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis (SpA) in patients with IBD, peripheral arthritis, sacroiliitis, and ankylosing spondylitis were present in 13, 10, and 3 percent, respectively, with considerable heterogeneity of the results between studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Arthritis has been estimated to occur in 6 to 46 percent of patients with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>], with spondylitis described in 1 to 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/6,8,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,12-15</a>]. As an example, in one cohort, 129 out of 350 patients with IBD reported at least one feature of spondyloarthritis (SpA); review of these patients' medical records showed 18 with axial SpA, 20 with peripheral SpA, and 14 with other rheumatic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Estimates vary for each form of joint involvement. (See <a href=\"#H231287246\" class=\"local\">'Spondylitis and sacroiliitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Type I arthropathy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Type II arthropathy'</a> below.)</p><p>Arthritis is somewhat more likely in patients with large bowel disease and in those patients with other extraenteric features, such as erythema nodosum, stomatitis, uveitis, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Among patients with Crohn disease, those with colonic involvement are at higher risk of developing synovitis than those with isolated small bowel disease. Males and females are affected equally. Both children and adults are at risk for this complication of IBD.</p><p>Subclinical gut inflammation, documented by endoscopy, has been described in up to two-thirds of patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], a finding that was confirmed in a subsequent prospective cohort of patients classified with SpA according to the Assessment in SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may manifest primarily with axial involvement, with features of spondylitis and sacroiliitis; with peripheral joint involvement; or with both axial and peripheral features. The peripheral arthritis is most commonly acute and remitting (Type I) or, less commonly, a chronic pattern with intermittent, more severe flares (Type II) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Enthesitis, and less often, dactylitis, may also occur. (See <a href=\"#H231287246\" class=\"local\">'Spondylitis and sacroiliitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Type I arthropathy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Type II arthropathy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3136814012\" class=\"local\">'Enthesitis and dactylitis'</a> below.)</p><p>The joints may be affected by conditions other than the characteristic forms of immune-mediated inflammatory arthritis associated with IBD reviewed here. An important example is infectious arthritis, which can occur in association with IBD and should be included in the differential diagnosis of IBD-related arthritis (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). The risk of septic arthritis of the sacroiliac or peripheral joints, which is a rare complication of IBD, is increased in patients with fistulization or bacteremia. Polymicrobial septic arthritis, although rare, may occur as the first sign of altered gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal integrity in a patient with underlying IBD.</p><p>Adverse effects of treatment for IBD may also affect joints. For example, glucocorticoid treatment is associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone) and increased infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1901407834\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A distinction has historically been made between two patterns of peripheral arthritis in patients with IBD-associated joint disease; however, this distinction between type 1 and type 2 arthropathy is no longer commonly used by most rheumatologists. Both subsets are considered to be peripheral SpA, without further differentiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Type I arthropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In type I arthropathy, the peripheral arthritis tends to be acute and pauciarticular (affecting six or fewer joints) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. It typically occurs early in the course of the bowel disease, is self-limiting (90 percent under six months), and is nonerosive. The knee is the joint most commonly affected.</p><p>Type I arthropathy affects about 5 percent of patients with IBD. Joint symptoms may occur prior to the onset of IBD symptoms, and this form of arthritis is often associated with flares of the bowel disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Type II arthropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Type II arthropathy, patients have polyarticular disease, with metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints being particularly involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other joints (knees, ankles, elbows, shoulders, wrists, proximal interphalangeal [PIP], and metatarsophalangeal [MTP] joints) are less often affected. Approximately one-half of the patients with IBD have migratory arthritis. Active synovitis may persist for months and may recur repeatedly but is nonerosive. Episodes of exacerbations and remissions may continue for years.</p><p>Type II arthropathy affects 3 to 4 percent of patients with IBD. Articular involvement rarely precedes the diagnosis of IBD, and joint symptoms typically do not parallel the activity of bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H231287246\"><span class=\"h2\">Spondylitis and sacroiliitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with spondylitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sacroiliitis usually report symptoms with characteristic features of inflammatory back pain, which should alert the gastroenterologist or internist to the possibility of SpA; patients typically complain of prolonged stiffness in the back <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> buttocks in the morning or after rest. Stiffness and associated pain are often relieved by exercise. Back symptoms are generally unrelated to the activity of the IBD.</p><p>Physical examination may reveal limited spinal flexion and reduced chest expansion in patients with longstanding SpA. Spondylitis may be the only articular manifestation; or it may occur in association with any form of peripheral arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Type I arthropathy'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with IBD can exhibit imaging findings of axial SpA more frequently than is evident from the history and examination (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> below). Asymptomatic sacroiliitis, detected by radiography, occurred in 4 to 18 percent of patients with IBD in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and a positive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggestive of sacroiliitis may be present but without accompanying back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], although MRI should be performed for the assessment of back pain only when clinically indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3136814012\"><span class=\"h2\">Enthesitis and dactylitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enthesitis, inflammation of the tendon insertion to the bone; and dactylitis, inflammation of the digit, often termed &quot;sausage-finger&quot; or &quot;sausage-toe,&quot; may occur in patients with IBD-associated arthritis, as in other forms of SpA. Plantar fasciitis, causing heel pain, and Achilles tendinitis are the most common forms of enthesitis observed. Estimates of the prevalence of enthesitis in a 2016 systematic review ranged widely, from 1 to 54 percent; most of the 14 estimates from the eight studies reported were in the lower part of this range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The prevalence of dactylitis, based upon 10 estimates from six studies, was less common than enthesitis, and ranged from zero (in two studies) to 6 percent.

However, in patients with quiescent gut disease but persistent inflammatory back pain, an elevated CRP may be considered as an objective parameter of inflammation in the axial skeleton and may help to select patients for more intensive treatment. Serum levels of rheumatoid factor are not elevated. The anemia of chronic disease may accompany chronic inflammation of gut or joint and should initiate a search for subclinical inflammation in either site. An unexplained iron-deficiency anemia in an SpA patient may be the first clue to incipient IBD.</p><p>HLA-B27 is found in 50 to 75 percent of the patients with IBD-associated axial arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. An increase in frequency in HLA-B27, B35, and DRB1*0103 has been described in those with a type I peripheral arthritis; type II arthropathy has been associated with HLA-B44 (and not B27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. While the reported HLA associations are of interest in regard to pathogenesis, HLA typing has no role in management of individual patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>). In one study, sacroiliitis in patients with Crohn disease was strongly associated with polymorphisms in the CARD15 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Synovial fluids have typically yielded from 5000 to 12,000 white blood cells per microliter, predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Synovial membrane biopsies reveal nonspecific abnormalities, including: proliferation of synovial lining cells, increased vascularity, and infiltration of mononuclear cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with axial disease, radiographs of the spine and pelvis may show typical findings of ankylosing spondylitis and sacroiliitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-axial-spondyloarthritis-ankylosing-spondylitis-and-nonradiographic-axial-spondyloarthritis-in-adults#H13068279\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults&quot;, section on 'Musculoskeletal imaging'</a>). Plain film radiographs of the peripheral joints may demonstrate soft-tissue swelling, juxta-articular osteoporosis, mild periostitis, and effusions, usually without erosions or destruction. Radiographs frequently have abnormal findings, even in asymptomatic patients with IBD.</p><p>In one study, for example, plain film and computed tomography (CT) were used to evaluate the sacroiliac joints of 65 patients with IBD, none of whom had symptoms of sacroiliitis; 18 percent had findings of sacroiliitis by plain film and 32 percent had had abnormal sacroiliac joints noted by CT scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, as mentioned above, the evaluation of the sacroiliac joints by conventional radiographs is difficult to standardize.</p><p>Given that interpretation of radiographs of the sacroiliac joints is particularly difficult, especially in the early stages of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-arthritis-associated-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-other-gastrointestinal-diseases/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], the mere presence of an abnormal radiograph&mdash;in the absence of suggestive clinical signs and symptoms&mdash;does not necessarily indicate a higher risk for the development of spondylitis. MRI can also reveal changes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69296\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69296 \">image 1</a>), but such changes may be seen without accompanying back pain; the prognostic significance of inflammation in the sacroiliac joint by MRI is uncertain and is an area of active investigation. Thus, an MRI is indicated when evaluating back pain in these patients but not in asymptomatic individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated arthritis should be suspected whenever an IBD patient develops joint pain, stiffness, or symptoms of inflammatory back pain. There may be accompanying joint swelling when peripheral joints, such as the hands or feet, are involved.</p><p>In patients whose arthritis affects a single joint (monoarthritis), or a few joints (oligoarthritis), it is particularly important to perform a joint aspiration to exclude septic arthritis, the presentation of which may be atypical in patients with IBD who are receiving antiinflammatory or immunosuppressive treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-monoarthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of monoarthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In IBD patients suspected of IBD-associated <span class=\"nowrap\">arthritis/spondyloarthritis</span> (SpA), based upon the presence of joint pain or swelling, we perform a thorough general history and physical examination, with particular attention to the presence of tender or swollen joints.

Other potential causes of similar symptoms should be excluded clinically. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Conversely, in SpA patients who develop abdominal pain, diarrhea, or weight loss, or who manifest an unexplained anemia, a referral to a gastroenterologist is indicated.

New-onset monoarthritis in an IBD patient should be considered septic until proven otherwise (with negative synovial fluid cultures). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic arthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disseminated-gonococcal-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disseminated gonococcal infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erythema nodosum</strong> &ndash; Erythema nodosum, which can occur in patients with IBD, may be difficult to distinguish from arthritis when lesions occur in a periarticular location. Inability to aspirate synovial fluid from a frankly swollen and painful joint is one clue to the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythema-nodosum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Erythema nodosum&quot;</a>.)

Tenosynovitis is common, with episodes possibly lasting for days and even months, affecting the knee, wrist, ankle, shoulder, and finger joints. It may also be responsible for pain in the neck and back. The risk of developing this syndrome is higher after jejunocolic than after jejunoileal surgery and higher in females than males.

Enthesitis may occasionally occur, and dactylitis may infrequently be present. (See <a href=\"#H3419338345\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I peripheral arthritis in IBD may be acute, remitting, pauciarticular, and occur early in disease. It commonly involves the knee and is usually nondeforming. Type II peripheral arthritis may be more chronic or have frequent relapses, polyarticular, and frequently involves the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Type I arthropathy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Type II arthropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spondylitis more frequently affects men with IBD. Typical symptoms are characteristic of inflammatory back pain, including prolonged stiffness and pain in the back <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> buttocks in the morning or after rest, which is often relieved by exercise. Back symptoms are unrelated to those of the gastrointestinal disease. Limited spinal flexion and reduced chest expansion may occur. Spondylitis may be the only articular manifestation or it may occur in association with type I peripheral arthropathy. (See <a href=\"#H231287246\" class=\"local\">'Spondylitis and sacroiliitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute phase reactants usually reflect the activity of the intestinal disease and are not useful in assessing peripheral arthritis or spondylitis, although the presence of an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) in a patient with quiescent gut disease may be an objective marker of inflammation in patients with spinal disease. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 is found in 50 to 75 percent of the patients with axial arthritis and may be increased in type I peripheral arthritis, but HLA typing has no role in management of individual patients. Synovial fluids are moderately inflammatory. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiographs of the spine and pelvis may show typical findings of ankylosing spondylitis and sacroiliitis. Radiographs, particularly of the sacroiliac joints, frequently have abnormal findings even in asymptomatic patients with IBD, but equivocal abnormalities should be interpreted with caution and always within the given clinical context. Plain radiographs of the peripheral joints may demonstrate soft-tissue swelling, juxta-articular osteoporosis, mild periostitis, and effusions, usually without erosions or destruction. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IBD-associated arthritis should be suspected in patients with IBD who develop joint pain, stiffness, or symptoms of inflammatory back pain. There is no pathognomonic finding to confirm that arthritis is due to IBD. It thus remains a diagnosis of exclusion, and septic arthritis should be excluded, particularly in patients with monoarthritis or oligoarthritis, given the risk of fistulization or bacteremia in patients with IBD. The differential diagnosis of arthritis associated with gastrointestinal disease also includes hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, osteonecrosis, erythema nodosum (particularly if periarticular), and other disorders in which both intestinal and joint or spine involvement may occur.
