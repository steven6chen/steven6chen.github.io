The components of management are monitoring, medical management (including temporizing relief of symptoms prior to surgery), management of arrhythmias, and surgical or catheter intervention. Many patients with Ebstein anomaly have no symptoms and require only monitoring while others are symptomatic and require supportive medical therapy and surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with Ebstein anomaly should undergo periodic monitoring.

For asymptomatic patients, we suggest monitoring every 6 to 12 months for patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (sooner if the right ventricle is dilated), every one to two years for patients with moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and every three to five years for patients with mild tricuspid regurgitation. Additional evaluation is indicated if the patient develops new cardiovascular symptoms or signs. &#160; </p><p>Monitoring should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical assessment for evidence of heart failure and cyanosis and exercise tolerance (with exercise testing with oximetry)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment for arrhythmias, with at least annual electrocardiogram (ECG) and 24-hour ambulatory (Holter) ECG monitor. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doppler transthoracic echocardiography to assess the severity of tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular size and function, left ventricular size and function and intracardiac shunt. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac MRI (CMR) may be helpful but the role of serial CMR has not been delineated in patients with Ebstein anomaly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H888694645\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2279675908\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacologic therapy for heart failure and cyanosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3510389833\"><span class=\"h4\">Management of symptomatic newborn</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical management in a newborn with cyanosis or heart failure is limited to supportive therapy until the pulmonary vascular resistance drops and normalizes with time. In case of extreme cyanosis, as noted in cases with functional or anatomic pulmonary valve atresia, prostaglandin E1 (also known as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprostadil</a>) infusion is indicated to keep the ductus arteriosus open and increase pulmonary blood flow until the pulmonary vascular resistance drops. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-cyanotic-heart-disease-in-the-newborn#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Prostaglandin E1'</a>.) </p><p>However, if pulmonary valve regurgitation is also present, initiation of prostaglandin E1 may result in high output failure due to creation of a circular shunt, ie, blood flows from left ventricle to aorta to pulmonary artery (through ductus arteriosus) and then, retrograde through pulmonary valve, right ventricle and tricuspid valve, across the atrial septum, and back into the left ventricle and aorta. If a circular shunt develops, prostaglandin E1 infusion should be terminated. The presence of concomitant pulmonary regurgitation in newborns with Ebstein anomaly carries a poor prognosis.</p><p>In the symptomatic newborn, inhaled nitric oxide may be helpful in reducing pulmonary vascular resistance and improving antegrade pulmonary blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Critically ill newborns may require inotropic support for stabilization until surgical intervention is performed or there is clinical improvement. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Milrinone</a> is most beneficial in this setting as it has inotropic, as well as pulmonary vasodilator effect that allows reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance augmenting the pulmonary blood flow. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> and other catecholamines should be avoided, as these may predispose to tachyarrhythmia in the setting of stretched right atrium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> accessory pathway(s). &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3714209128\"><span class=\"h4\">Management of symptomatic child</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most symptomatic children will undergo surgical repair before requiring any medical therapy.

Atrial tachyarrhythmias (fibrillation and flutter) can also be treated with right-sided or bi-atrial Maze procedure at the time of surgical repair. Bi-atrial Maze procedure may be preferable to catheter based ablation for persistent or permanent atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrillation/flutter</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The acute success rate of radiofrequency ablation for patients with single pathway was 77 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(26/34</span> patients) and for multiple pathways the success rate was 90 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(17/19</span> patients). Ablation of a right free wall or right septal pathway was initially successful in 79 and 89 percent, respectively; however, the recurrence rate was 32 and 29 percent. Among those with arrhythmias unassociated with an accessory pathway, ablation was initially successful in 75 percent, and 27 percent had recurrence. </p><p>A later multicenter study that reported on catheter ablations in 32 patients with Ebstein anomaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] confirmed that patients with Ebstein anomaly often have multiple arrhythmogenic substrates; the most frequent ablation targets were accessory pathways, followed by macroreentrant atrial circuits. Further, arrhythmia recurrence is frequent after ablation due to conduction recovery. A single-center study showed high diagnostic and therapeutic yield of preoperative electrophysiology study in patients with Ebstein anomaly, aged 0.2 to 56 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Based on this study, centers are increasingly performing routine preoperative electrophysiology study to identify arrhythmias and accessory conduction pathways; ablation of accessory pathways prior to surgical repair is generally suggested as catheter-based ablation becomes challenging after the area around the accessory pathway has been plicated.</p><p>Indications for arrhythmia surgery (surgical ablation of accessory pathways or a Maze procedure) concomitant with tricuspid valve repair or replacement and atrial septal defect (ASD) closure are atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular arrhythmias not amenable to percutaneous treatment and ventricular preexcitation not successfully treated in the electrophysiology lab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Cyanosis due to an intracardiac right-to-left shunt may first become manifest during pregnancy because of the rise in right ventricular filling pressure. The right-to-left intracardiac shunt increases the risk of paradoxical embolization, and hypoxemia increases the fetal risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

A literature review of studies published between 1985 and 2007 found the following rates of complications during completed (&gt;20 weeks gestation) pregnancies among women with Ebstein anomaly (combined repaired and unrepaired): arrhythmias in 5 of 127 pregnancies (3.9 percent); heart failure in 4 of 127 pregnancies (3.1 percent); and no cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality) in the majority (128) of pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>There is significant fetal risk associated with Ebstein anomaly. These include an increased incidence of prematurity, fetal wastage, and congenital heart disease regardless of the presence or absence of maternal cyanosis. The above cited review reported the rates of fetal complications among completed (&gt;20 weeks gestation) pregnancies: premature delivery occurred in 28 of 127 pregnancies (22 percent), fetal mortality rate in none of 128 pregnancies, and perinatal mortality in 3 of 128 pregnancies (2.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

A fetal echocardiogram is recommended around 18 to 22 weeks gestation. Some patients require frequent follow-up, and others require minimal cardiovascular care during pregnancy. The patient with an ASD or patent foramen ovale (PFO) requires special care and monitoring; some of these patients experience oxygen desaturation during pregnancy, which can adversely affect the fetal growth and well-being.

Surgical repair techniques have evolved markedly and thus comparison between different series is challenging. Outcomes after surgical repair procedures are dependent on the experience of the surgical center and vary between different centers. Most reported series are derived from large centers with extensive experience and may not be applicable to smaller centers with less experience. For example, in a European multicenter study, operative mortality was 13.3 percent, which was higher than in most larger single-center studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. These factors have to be carefully taken into account in individual decision-making and surgical referral.</p><p>Observational data suggest that survival is increasing as advances in diagnostic, surgical techniques, and postoperative care have led to improvements in outcome. This was illustrated in a report of 158 patients who received a primary tricuspid bioprosthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Ten-year survival was 93 percent with freedom from bioprosthesis replacement at 10 and 15 years of 98 and 81 percent, respectively; 92 percent were New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I or II and 94 percent were not receiving anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Similar results were noted in a review of 60 patients who underwent surgical repair of the tricuspid valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Hospital mortality was 3 percent, actuarial survival was 97 and 83 percent at one and 18 years, respectively, and 94 percent of survivors were NYHA class I or II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Studies of surgical intervention have found that the presence of more than moderate right ventricular dysfunction was the only independent predictor of early mortality after surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In the setting of severe tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular myocardial contractility and postoperative right ventricular systolic function may be markedly overestimated by measurements of preoperative right ventricular ejection fraction. For this reason, we suggest early surgical intervention before the development of significant right heart enlargement, hoping to prevent progressive right ventricular dysfunction. At experienced centers, the standard surgical repair can be performed with low mortality and excellent durability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In the published report from our institution, 84 patients underwent surgical repair of Ebstein anomaly at a mean age of 10 &plusmn; 6 years.

In a different report describing 81 patients with Ebstein anomaly over 50 years of age, 89 surgical procedures were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Tricuspid valve replacement was done in 65 (73 percent) and repair was performed in only 22 (25 percent) patients. There were three early deaths. Most patients (89 percent) had improved functional class on long-term follow-up. The 20-year survival for this cohort was 65 versus 74 percent for age and sex-matched controls.

A biologic prosthesis is usually chosen because of the high incidence of thrombosis with a mechanical prosthesis placed in the right heart, particularly when the right ventricular function is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-ebstein-anomaly/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Porcine valve prosthesis is preferred rather than a pericardial valve prosthesis since it functions better in a low flow setting and is less likely to thrombose. The prosthesis is usually placed in an intraatrial position in order to avoid injury to the right coronary artery or the exposed conduction tissue. Complete atrioventricular block is a complication of tricuspid valve replacement, particularly in less experienced centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1885208052\"><span class=\"h4\">For infants</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical repair in the neonate consists of a biventricular repair or the single-ventricle repair.

However, for patients with advanced symptoms of right heart failure with significant right ventricular enlargement or dysfunction, a 1.5-ventricle repair is preferred. Importantly, a low pulmonary vascular resistance is key for normal functioning of a bidirectional cavo-pulmonary anastomosis. In adults with right ventricular systolic dysfunction, preoperative hemodynamic assessment including assessment of pulmonary vascular resistance is mandatory in case a bidirectional cavo-pulmonary anastomosis becomes necessary.
