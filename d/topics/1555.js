Significant valvular heart disease is often first diagnosed based upon the finding of a murmur. Auscultation has a reported sensitivity of 70 percent and a specificity of 98 percent for detection of valvular heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the sensitivity and specificity vary substantially with the expertise of the examiner. The expertise and proficiency in auscultation has been waning in the modern era, which has led to a greater dependence on more expensive imaging techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. </p><p>In clinical practice, echocardiography is the standard for establishing the cause of a murmur. As noted in major society guidelines, an echocardiogram is indicated for the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with known or suspected valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Echocardiography is not needed in asymptomatic patients with a benign flow murmur but is appropriate in patients with cardiac symptoms and any cardiac murmur. It is also indicated in asymptomatic patients with a diastolic murmur, a grade 3 or greater systolic murmur, or a systolic murmur in association with other abnormal exam findings, such as a systolic click or reduced carotid upstroke.</p><p>This topic will review the auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults, including the maneuvers (eg, respiration, Valsalva maneuver) that can be used to differentiate one murmur from another. These maneuvers, as well as auscultation of other heart sounds, are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pharmacologic-maneuvers-in-the-differential-diagnosis-of-heart-murmurs-and-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pharmacologic maneuvers in the differential diagnosis of heart murmurs and sounds&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac murmurs in infants and children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-common-causes-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of common causes of cardiac murmurs in infants and children&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1084962072\"><span class=\"h1\">ORIGIN OF MURMURS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac murmurs are the direct result of blood flow turbulence. The amount of turbulence and consequently the intensity of a cardiac murmur depend on the size of the orifice or vessel through which the blood flows; the pressure difference or gradient across the narrowing; and the blood flow or volume across the site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Murmurs are generally the loudest near the point of origin since sound radiates away from its source, and the intensity diminishes with the square of the distance. Other factors influence this relationship including the transmission characteristics of the tissues (eg, fat and air), the distance from the location of auscultation to the origin of the murmur (eg, truncal obesity, emphysema), and the course of flow. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2088878673\"><span class=\"h1\">AUSCULTATORY TOOLS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1482266118\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard stethoscope (acoustic based)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard stethoscope includes both a shallow bell for low frequencies and a thin, stiff diaphragm for high frequencies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3066826226\"><span class=\"h2\">Electronic stethoscope (sensor based)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Auscultatory devices have been developed that utilize advanced acoustic sensor-based digital signal processing. The clinician has the choice of a bell, a diaphragm, and a wide range of frequencies for better body sound acquisition. It also allows the clinician to record the heart sounds directly onto a computer for further visualization and analysis.</p><p>There are no objective data to support the claim that the electronic stethoscope provides superior auscultatory skills over the conventional stethoscope. In a study from Norway, cardiac auscultation skills of undergraduate medical students were not impacted by being trained on either an electronic or a conventional stethoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2380658103\"><span class=\"h1\">PERFORMANCE OF AUSCULTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should develop a routine of listening systematically to all components of the cardiac cycle and all auscultatory areas with both the bell and diaphragm. The timing of the murmur is best achieved by identifying S1 and S2, helped if needed by timing them with the carotid pulse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with marked tachycardia, a long diastolic murmur can occasionally be confused with a systolic murmur; timing with the carotid pulse upstroke avoids an incorrect diagnosis. When appropriate, patients should routinely be auscultated in the supine (including left lateral decubitus), sitting, and standing positions. It is helpful to routinely assess at least four surface anatomical areas with the stethoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tricuspid area</strong>: The fourth and fifth intercostal spaces along the left sternal edge often extending to the right of the sternum as well as downward to the subxiphisternal area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary area</strong>: The second intercostal space along the left sternal border. Murmurs that are best heard in this area may also extend to the left infraclavicular area or lower along the left sternal edge to the third intercostal space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mitral area</strong>: At the cardiac apex, which is generally at the fifth intercostal space in the midclavicular line. This area may also extend medially to the left sternal edge and also laterally to the region of the axilla. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aortic area</strong>: Mainly centered at the second right intercostal space, but may extend to the suprasternal area, neck, and inferiorly to the third left intercostal space. </p><p/><p>Under certain circumstances, murmurs are audible over areas of the chest that are relatively remote from the heart. A systolic murmur can be audible over the anterior aspects of both lungs in patients with peripheral pulmonary stenosis. In addition, a continuous murmur can be audible in the apical region of lung on the side of created arteriovenous fistula in the arm. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MURMUR DESCRIPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The character of a murmur is described by a number of features, including intensity (grade), pitch (frequency), configuration, timing, quality, location, and radiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Intensity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intensity of a murmur is primarily determined by the quantity and velocity of blood flow at the site of its origin, the transmission characteristic of the tissues between the blood flow and stethoscope, the site of auscultation or recording, and the distance of transmission. In general, the intensity declines in the presence of obesity, emphysema, and pericardial effusion. Murmurs are usually louder in thin individuals.</p><p>Six grades are used to classify the intensity of a murmur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I: faintest murmur that can be heard (with difficulty; murmur usually softer than first [S1] and second [S2] heart sounds)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II: faint murmur but has the same intensity as S1 and S2</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III: louder than S1 and S2 without a palpable thrill</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade IV: loud and is associated with a palpable thrill</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade V: very loud with a thrill and can be heard with slightest touch of the stethoscope</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade VI: loudest and can be heard without a stethoscope</p><p/><p>The gradation of intensity is purely subjective. However, it allows recognition of changes in the intensity of the murmur, which has diagnostic relevance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pitch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of the murmur determines the pitch, which may be high or low. The quality can be described as harsh, rumbling, scratchy, grunting, blowing, squeaky, vibratory, and musical. Quality and pitch are closely related.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Configuration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The time course of murmur intensity corresponds to the &quot;shape&quot; of a diagram of murmur intensity over time, as in a phonocardiogram. A number of configurations or shapes of murmurs are recognized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crescendo (increasing)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrescendo (diminishing)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crescendo-decrescendo (increasing-decreasing or diamond shaped)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plateau (unchanged in intensity)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Location and radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The location on the patient's chest where the murmur is loudest is typically described as apical, and parasternal or over the base of the heart (aortic and pulmonary areas). Parasternal murmurs are further characterized by the intercostal space and right or left side of the sternum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is also helpful to assess the area over which the murmur is audible (radiation); for example, document if the murmur is audible in the axilla, suprasternal notch, or over inferior aspect of the left scapula. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification by timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of a murmur is assessed by determining the length of systole or diastole that the murmur occupies. The murmur can be long (eg, it occupies most of systole or diastole), or it can be brief. The following classification is useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic murmurs: Starts with or after S1 and terminates before or at S2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61744\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61744 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early systolic: Obscures S1 and extends for a variable length in systole but does not extend up to S2</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Midsystolic (or systolic ejection): Begins after S1 and ends before A2 (left sided) or P2 (right sided) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65728 \">table 1</a>).

Early systolic murmurs may result from mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation, or ventricular septal defect (VSD).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H390931644\"><span class=\"h3\">Mitral regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either acute severe or mild chronic MR can be associated with an early systolic murmur. Acute severe MR usually causes a rapid increase in left atrial pressure leading to progressive equalization with left ventricular pressure. This hemodynamic alteration prevents regurgitant flow during the latter part of systole. Thus, the regurgitant murmur terminates before A2. Since the regurgitant flow is maximal at the beginning of systole and decreases with increasing left atrial pressure, a decrescendo configuration of this early systolic murmur is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Associated clinical findings include pulmonary hypertension, hyperdynamic apical impulse, a late systolic left parasternal impulse, and atrial and ventricular gallops. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mitral regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some patients with mitral stenosis, an early systolic murmur is heard and probably represents mild MR. Secondary MR in dilated cardiomyopathy is usually mild and may be early systolic in timing. Mitral annular calcification can be associated with an early systolic murmur and suggests trivial MR. Ineffective reduction of the circumference of the annulus at the beginning of systole, due to calcification, is probably the underlying mechanism for mild MR and the early systolic murmur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2773428781\"><span class=\"h3\">Tricuspid regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary tricuspid regurgitation with normal right ventricular systolic pressure, as seen with infective endocarditis in drug addicts, may be associated with an early systolic murmur with a decrescendo configuration. The mechanism is similar to that in acute severe MR. The frequency of these murmurs is usually lower than the murmurs associated with an elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, presumably due to a lower rate of regurgitation. In addition to a relatively normal S2, palpating and recording the left parasternal impulse may reveal a systolic inward movement and a diastolic outward movement, reflecting right ventricular volume changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4254680945\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventricular septal defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a large VSD with pulmonary hypertension, the murmur may be early systolic in timing, since the increasing right ventricular pressure during late systole decreases the left-to-right shunt. Findings of pulmonary hypertension are always present. An early systolic murmur may also occur in some patients with a VSD in the absence of pulmonary hypertension or increased pulmonary vascular resistance; these murmurs are more frequently localized and of shorter duration. They tend to occur with VSDs that later close spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Small muscular VSDs may also cause an early systolic murmur, since the defect closes soon after the onset of systole. Evidence of pulmonary hypertension is absent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults#H26371633\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular septal defect in adults&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Midsystolic ejection murmurs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ejection or midsystolic murmur (MSM) is related to flow of blood across the semilunar valves; onset of the MSM coincides with the beginning of ejection and termination occurs with the cessation of forward flow. S1 occurs at the onset of isovolumic systole when ventricular pressure rises; ejection, and thus the MSM, begins at the end of isovolumic systole when the ventricular pressures exceed the semilunar valve opening pressure. The onset of an MSM is therefore separated from S1 and the interval between S1 and the onset of the murmur is proportional to the duration of isovolumic systole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61744\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61744 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The intensity of the MSM increases (crescendo) during acceleration of blood flow early in systole; intensity declines (decrescendo) with the later deceleration of flow, resulting in a crescendo-decrescendo (diamond-shaped) configuration. Forward flow from the ventricle stops when ventricular pressure falls below the aortic or pulmonary artery pressures, before the closure of the semilunar valves. The murmur terminates with cessation of flow, before A2 or P2, depending upon whether the murmur is left or right sided, respectively. The interval between the termination of the murmur and A2 or P2 is proportional to the aortic or pulmonic hangout time, respectively.</p><p>The most common causes of an MSM are benign (innocent) flow murmurs, an increase in flow rate across a normal semilunar valve, and aortic valve sclerosis. These physiologic murmurs need to be distinguished from the abnormal MSM in patients with fixed or dynamic outflow tract obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65728 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Innocent midsystolic murmurs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systolic murmur is present in up to 60 percent of patients, with 90 percent being associated with a normal echocardiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These innocent or benign &quot;flow&quot; murmurs are typically ejection type and midsystolic in timing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65728 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The &quot;innocence&quot; of an MSM should not depend upon the duration or intensity of the murmur, but on the absence of other abnormal findings. Even a short grade <span class=\"nowrap\">I/VI</span> ejection mid-systolic murmur may not be innocent if there are coexisting findings such as an abnormal S2.</p><p>In young adults, an innocent MSM can be heard that has a blowing quality and is best heard over the pulmonary area. This murmur is thought to originate from vibrations of the pulmonary trunk. </p><p>In patients with the straight back syndrome who have a decreased anteroposterior diameter of the chest, a superficial MSM is heard over the left second interspace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The mechanism of the murmur remains unclear. The murmur is often enhanced by firm application of the stethoscope over the pulmonary area, suggesting that an anatomical distortion of the RV outflow tract and pulmonary valve and artery by the chest deformity plays a role in generating the murmur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Increased semilunar blood flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An MSM also occurs in the presence of normal valves when flow across the semilunar valve is significantly increased, as occurs in the following settings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65728 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia, pregnancy, and thyrotoxicosis. As an example, a pulmonic MSM is present in over 80 percent of normal pregnant women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with pure aortic regurgitation, an ejection mid-systolic murmur may result from markedly increased flow across the aortic valve and should not be considered evidence for aortic stenosis in the absence of other findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An atrial septal defect with left to right shunting results in an ejection mid-systolic murmur resulting from increased flow across the pulmonic valve accompanied by fixed split S2. This does not indicate associated pulmonic stenosis. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic valve sclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The murmur of aortic sclerosis is also a midsystolic ejection murmur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61744\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61744 \">figure 1</a>). It is not associated with hemodynamic consequences, but it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of aortic stenosis in elderly patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aortic valve sclerosis and pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The murmur is usually best heard over the right second interspace. In some patients, a musical high-frequency murmur of brief duration can be heard along the lower left sternal border and cardiac apex. In general, the murmur is brief and not very loud. A normal carotid pulse and normal S2 confirm the absence of significant aortic valve obstruction.</p><p>The clinical significance of the diagnosis of aortic sclerosis is that it is a risk factor for long-term adverse outcomes due to atherosclerotic heart disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic outflow obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An MSM associated with fixed aortic obstruction due to valvular, subvalvular, or supravalvular stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) typically is harsh and medium pitch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65728 \">table 1</a>). The time the murmur peaks after its onset bears some correlation to the severity of the obstruction. In patients with aortic stenosis (AS), the longer- and later-peaking murmur is usually associated with hemodynamically significant obstruction; a brief and early peaking murmur indicates less severe AS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61744\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61744 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>However, the intensity of the murmur is variable and may not correlate with the severity of stenosis. A grade 4 or greater murmur is specific but not sensitive for the diagnosis of severe AS, as most patients with severe AS have a grade 3 murmur. The A2 component of S2 is diminished and frequently absent in severe AS. Furthermore, the presence of heart failure and a reduced stroke volume, the duration, configuration, and intensity bear a poor correlation to the degree of obstruction.</p><p>An ejection sound at the onset of the murmur suggests congenital aortic stenosis or a bicuspid valve. The ejection sound is usually absent in severe AS.</p><p>The site of maximum intensity and direction of radiation of the murmur are related to the site of obstruction and the direction of the jet in the aortic root. Nevertheless, echocardiography is required for accurate determination of the site and severity of a fixed obstruction (valvular, supravalvular, or subvalvular).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h4\">Valvular aortic stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In valvular AS, the maximum intensity is appreciated over the right second interspace; a thrill may be palpable over the same area. The murmur radiates up into the neck and over both carotid arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51024 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>In older patients with calcific trileaflet AS, an MSM with a musical quality is frequently heard over the cardiac apex or along the lower left sternal border, in addition to a harsh murmur over the right second interspace (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67896\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef67896 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56063\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56063 \">movie 2</a>). A musical murmur appears to originate from the vibration of the valve and subvalvular structures and can be recorded in the left ventricular (LV) cavity (Gallavardin phenomenon); a harsh murmur originates in the aortic root and is related to the high-velocity ejection jet.

Although the etiology of the murmur will be readily established by echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], a number of helpful distinguishing features can be elicited by auscultation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61744\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61744 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The murmur is likely to be mid-systolic if A2 is clearly audible over the cardiac apex.

There are three causes of holosystolic murmurs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral regurgitation (MR)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricuspid regurgitation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular septal defect (VSD)</p><p/><p>The timing and duration of holosystolic murmurs are best explained by the hemodynamic changes of MR. In hemodynamically significant MR, regurgitant flow from the left ventricle to the left atrium begins with the onset of isovolumic systole when pressure in the left ventricle just exceeds pressure in the left atrium. This pressure crossover point also marks S1, explaining the onset of the holosystolic murmur with S1. Throughout systole and extending to the early part of the isovolumic relaxation phase, the left ventricular (LV) pressure remains higher than the left atrial pressure. Thus, the regurgitant flow continues throughout systole, and even after aortic valve closure, explaining the holosystolic character of the regurgitant murmur. This also explains why A2 is often drowned by the murmur over the cardiac apex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Mitral regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The holosystolic murmur of MR is high pitched and best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope and the patient in the left lateral decubitus position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56783\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56783 \">movie 5</a>).

Thus, it can be confused with the murmur of aortic stenosis or obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The character of the carotid pulse and the behavior of S2 provide important clues to the diagnosis.</p><p/><p>Associated physical findings may help to characterize the nature and severity of MR, although with significant limitations. A more benign overall examination is suggestive of less severe MR and primary valve disease. Abnormalities (eg, S3, an accentuated P2, or a displaced apical impulse) are less helpful, since they can occur with primary valve disease, secondary MR, or a separate cardiac or pulmonary abnormality. The holosystolic murmur of severe MR is occasionally accompanied by a mid-diastolic flow murmur due to increased diastolic flow across the mitral valve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The value and limitations of associated physical findings in a patient with MR is illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of an S3 and cardiac enlargement suggest hemodynamically insignificant chronic MR.

Radiation and respiratory changes in the intensity of the murmur are two important distinguishing features.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With tricuspid regurgitation, the murmur is heard along the left or right sternal border and may radiate to the epigastrium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the inspiratory phase of respiration, the intensity of the murmur of tricuspid regurgitation increases (Carvallo's sign, also known as Rivero-Carvallo's sign) if severe right ventricular failure is not present. The increase in intensity does not occur immediately with the onset of inspiration, but after one or two cardiac cycles. The mechanism for the increase in intensity appears to be augmented regurgitant flow following the inspiratory increase in right ventricular volume. A right ventricular S3 gallop and a mid-diastolic flow murmur, which also increase in intensity with inspiration, suggest more severe tricuspid regurgitation.</p><p/><p>Murmur intensity does not change in the presence of severe right ventricular failure when right ventricular volume may not change appreciably. With severe right-sided heart failure, the murmur can be absent, or only an early systolic murmur may be recognized. In these circumstances, the bedside diagnosis of tricuspid regurgitation relies upon the presence of other physical findings, such as a prominent v wave in the jugular venous pulse and systolic hepatic pulsation.</p><p>Tricuspid regurgitation is most often secondary to pulmonary arterial hypertension. Thus, a prominent left parasternal impulse and narrow splitting of S2 with an accentuated P2 suggest secondary tricuspid regurgitation. Theoretically, severe tricuspid regurgitation may produce reversed splitting of S2 due to shortened right ventricular ejection time; however, this is a rare finding.</p><p>Primary tricuspid regurgitation is much less common but can occur following bacterial endocarditis (eg, with intravenous drug abuse) or in patients with Ebstein's anomaly, carcinoid heart disease, or prior right ventricular infarction. A hyperdynamic left parasternal impulse and normal or only slightly accentuated P2 suggest primary tricuspid regurgitation, but its diagnosis primarily depends upon the elimination of pulmonary hypertension and left-sided disorders such as mitral and aortic valve disease and cardiomyopathy. In primary tricuspid regurgitation, the murmur may be early systolic rather than holosystolic, and have a decrescendo shape.

Thus, S2 is normal and pulmonary hypertension is absent.</p><p>The murmur is usually loud and may be accompanied by a thrill. The left-to-right shunt is directed toward the right ventricular cavity. The murmur is maximal over the third and fourth interspaces along the sternal border when the VSD is below the crista supraventricularis. When the defect is above the crista, the shunt is directed toward the pulmonary trunk; the maximal intensity of the murmur may be in the left second interspace in this case, and it can be confused with the murmur of pulmonary valve stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Changes in S2 help in the differential diagnosis.

Mitral valve prolapse can occur from disorders of the mitral annulus, redundancy of the leaflets, abnormalities of the chordae, or contraction abnormalities of the left ventricular wall.

This disparity increases with a decreased left ventricular volume, which is associated with an earlier onset of prolapse and, therefore, the late systolic murmur occupies a relatively greater portion of systole. Abrupt standing, sitting, or Valsalva maneuver (phase 2) decreases left ventricular volume and causes an earlier onset of the click and murmur, so the murmur lengthens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75155\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75155 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57858\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef57858 \">movie 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80360\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80360 \">movie 7</a>).

If the aortic pressure remains higher than left ventricular pressure throughout diastole, a pandiastolic murmur may be present, even when the severity of aortic regurgitation is only moderate. Bedside evaluation of the severity of aortic regurgitation should be primarily based upon a determination of the hemodynamic consequences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An Austin Flint murmur is usually associated with significant aortic regurgitation (see <a href=\"#H44\" class=\"local\">'Austin Flint murmur'</a> below). A decreased intensity of S2 does not necessarily suggest significant aortic regurgitation; however, reversed splitting of S2, which in the absence of left bundle branch block results from increased left ventricular forward stroke volume, indirectly suggests significant aortic regurgitation. Changes in the intensity of S1 should be noted, since a reduced intensity is usually associated with an elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which is more likely to occur in severe aortic regurgitation. Physical findings of pulmonary venous, arterial hypertension, and right-sided heart failure indicate hemodynamically significant aortic regurgitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Assessment of left ventricular function is important, particularly with respect to the timing of surgery. A hyperdynamic left ventricular impulse is associated with a relatively normal ejection fraction. On the other hand, a sustained impulse and S3 gallop may indicate a reduced ejection fraction; further evaluation to assess left ventricular function is indicated in this circumstance.</p><p>The onset of heart failure can modify many of the physical findings that suggest significant aortic regurgitation. The pulse pressure that was initially high may decrease, and the arterial diastolic pressure that was low may increase. The duration of the regurgitant murmur may decrease as the left ventricular diastolic pressure increases.</p><p>The hemodynamic consequences of acute, severe aortic regurgitation differ considerably from those of chronic aortic regurgitation, explaining the differences in physical findings.

The murmur of pulmonic regurgitation associated with pulmonary hypertension is high-pitched and &quot;blowing.&quot; It begins with an accentuated P2 of S2 and can be of variable duration. It may occupy all of diastole if there is a pandiastolic gradient between the pulmonary artery and the right ventricular diastolic pressure. The murmur has a decrescendo configuration like that of aortic regurgitation; differentiation is difficult if not impossible by auscultation alone. The murmur may increase in intensity during inspiration and can be more localized. It is best heard over the left second and third interspaces.</p><p>In contrast, the murmur of residual pulmonic regurgitation after Tetralogy of Fallot repair typically is low pitched and soft because pulmonary pressures are normal, so there is only a small diastolic pressure difference between the pulmonary artery and right ventricle. A to-and-fro murmur over the left second intercostal space may be noted or there may be no audible murmur with severe pulmonic regurgitation.</p><p>Pulmonic regurgitation can occur in the absence of pulmonary hypertension, as in patients with idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery, after pulmonic valvulotomy, with right-sided endocarditis, and with congenital absence of the pulmonic valve. In these conditions, the pulmonary artery diastolic pressure is normal or low and there is a lower rate of regurgitant flow; the regurgitant murmur is of low to medium pitch.</p><p>In congenital absence of the pulmonic valve, P2 is absent and there is a silent interval between A2 and the onset of the regurgitant murmur.

The murmur is not widespread like that of aortic regurgitation and usually is best heard over the left second or third interspace, a little lateral to the left sternal border.

The murmur originates in the left ventricular cavity, explaining its location of maximum intensity.</p><p>The murmur is present both in sinus rhythm and in atrial fibrillation. It characteristically starts with an opening snap. Its duration, which correlates with the duration of the diastolic pressure gradient across the mitral valve, is a reasonably good guide to assess the severity of mitral stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In patients with sinus rhythm, there is frequently a presystolic accentuation of the diastolic murmur. The longer the duration of the murmur, the more severe is the mitral stenosis, provided the diastolic interval is not too short (absence of tachycardia). If the murmur extends up to S1 during a longer diastolic interval, it can be assumed that the pressure gradient is still present at end-diastole, which implies severe mitral stenosis.</p><p>When the flow across the mitral valve is markedly reduced, which may result from associated right-sided heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, the murmur may be of very brief duration or even absent (so-called silent mitral stenosis), even in the presence of severe mitral stenosis. Conversely, with enhanced flow across the valve, as in the high-output state of pregnancy, the intensity and duration of the murmur increase even with less severe stenosis. In these circumstances, one cannot rely on the duration of the murmur to assess the severity of mitral stenosis; other ancillary investigations, particularly echocardiographic studies, are necessary.

The most characteristic feature is the increase in intensity of the murmur with inspiration (Carvallo's sign or Rivero-Carvallo's sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The mid-diastolic rumble may be associated with a tricuspid opening snap and wide splitting of S1 due to delayed closure of the tricuspid valve. Most patients with tricuspid stenosis are in atrial fibrillation and the murmur is mid-diastolic when the transvalvular pressure gradient is maximum. In sinus rhythm, the murmur may occur only in late diastole, resulting from an increased flow due to right atrial systole.</p><p>Tricuspid stenosis most frequently occurs in association with mitral stenosis.

In left atrial myxoma, the auscultatory findings can be similar to those of mitral stenosis. The murmur is frequently presystolic and crescendo in configuration; it appears to occur with the onset of ventricular systole when the tumor is moved toward the left atrium through the mitral orifice, and when the flow across the valve is still continuing.</p><p>It is difficult to distinguish between a left atrial myxoma and mitral stenosis at the bedside. However, the character and intensity of the murmur due to an atrial myxoma may change with alterations of position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Sinus rhythm, changing intensity and character of the murmur, and a &quot;tumor plop&quot; sound favor the diagnosis of left atrial myxoma. Nevertheless, echocardiographic evaluation is necessary and is always recommended in a patient with suspected mitral stenosis.</p><p>Right atrial myxoma is far less common than left atrial myxoma.

In pure severe mitral regurgitation, a larger volume of blood (due to the regurgitant volume) moves from the left atrium to the left ventricle during diastole; the etiology is a partial closing movement of the mitral valve, which occurs after it opens widely at the beginning of diastole. The rapid flow to the left ventricle continues, and thus &quot;functional mitral stenosis&quot; occurs, explaining the mid-diastolic rumble. In some patients, a mid-diastolic pressure gradient has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p>In a left-to-right shunt, antegrade blood flow across the mitral valve increases during diastole, which may be associated with a mid-diastolic murmur. The mechanism may be similar to that seen in mitral regurgitation. When the etiology is an atrial septal defect or anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, a tricuspid flow murmur can also be heard along the lower left sternal border; this is due to a partial closing movement of the tricuspid valve after its full opening in early diastole and functional tricuspid stenosis at mid-diastole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the genesis of this murmur, including fluttering of the mitral valve from the impingement by the aortic regurgitant jet, relative (functional) mitral stenosis, and regurgitant jets directed against the left ventricular free wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p>Mitral fluttering is not the mechanism of the Austin Flint murmur, since fluttering occurs in early diastole with the onset of regurgitation, while the rumble occurs in mid or late diastole. A second proposed mechanism was premature partial closing movement of the mitral valve at mid-diastole due to the regurgitant flow, leading to functional mitral stenosis. However, use of M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography, color flow Doppler, and cine magnetic resonance imaging has shown that the murmur arises from the regurgitant jets that are directed at the left ventricular free wall, thus excluding functional mitral stenosis as the etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>If the Austin Flint murmur is not recognized, a mistaken diagnosis of organic mitral stenosis can occur.

An Austin Flint murmur tends to decrease in intensity and duration as the severity of the aortic regurgitation decreases with decreased left ventricular afterload.

They usually have a crescendo configuration. The murmurs result from increased flow across the mitral or tricuspid valve and are most frequently observed in the presence of normal sinus rhythm. However, crescendo presystolic murmurs can occur in the presence of atrial fibrillation in the absence of atrial systole; mitral valve closure, resulting in a reduction of an effective mitral orifice, begins before the onset of isovolumic systole and S1 and during this period antegrade flow across the mitral valve continues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47\"><span class=\"h3\">Mitral stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial contraction increases the pressure gradient and flow at end-diastole when mitral stenosis is present, generating the presystolic murmur.

They do not necessarily need to occupy the total duration of systole and diastole. Continuous murmurs result from blood flow from a higher pressure chamber or vessel to a lower system associated with a persistent pressure gradient between these areas during systole and diastole. These murmurs may occur due to aortopulmonary connections, arteriovenous communication, and disturbances in the flow patterns in the arteries or veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54292\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54292 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50660\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50660 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53\"><span class=\"h2\">Patent ductus arteriosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patent ductus arteriosus is a relatively common cause of a continuous murmur in adults.

The duration of the murmur depends upon the pressure difference between aorta and pulmonary artery. With pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure increases; when it approaches systemic level, the diastolic portion of the continuous murmur becomes shorter and ultimately absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. With more severe pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary artery systolic pressure can equalize with aortic systolic pressure and the systolic component of the murmur may also be absent (silent ductus).

The murmur of a circumflex coronary artery and coronary sinus communication are usually located in the left axilla. The configuration of the murmur and the intensity of the systolic and diastolic components are variable. Marked systolic compression of the abnormal vessels reduces the systolic flow; thus, the systolic component of the murmur may be very soft.

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Midsystolic ejection murmurs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic valve stenosis causes an abnormal mid-systolic murmur that typically is loudest over the right second intercostal space and radiates to the carotids. A mid-systolic murmur associated with a single S2 suggests severe aortic stenosis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fixed aortic valve obstruction is distinguished from dynamic subaortic outflow tract obstruction by changes in the murmur with maneuvers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65728 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Midsystolic ejection murmurs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A holosystolic murmur is caused by mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, or a small ventricular septal defect (except for some small muscular ventricular septal defects). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Holosystolic murmurs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An early systolic murmur is caused by acute severe or mild chronic mitral regurgitation, primary tricuspid regurgitation with normal right ventricular pressures, a large ventricular septal defect, or a small muscular ventricular septal defect. (See <a href=\"#H3618010364\" class=\"local\">'Early systolic murmurs'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late systolic murmurs are most commonly caused by mitral valve prolapse, which may be accompanied by a late systolic murmur of tricuspid valve prolapse. The murmur of ischemic mitral regurgitation (caused by infarction or ischemia) is frequently late systolic. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Late systolic murmurs'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An early diastolic murmur is usually due to aortic or pulmonic regurgitation. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Early diastolic murmurs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral stenosis causes a mid-diastolic murmur, a late diastolic murmur, or both. (See <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Mitral stenosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H47\" class=\"local\">'Mitral stenosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricuspid stenosis with sinus rhythm causes a late diastolic murmur while tricuspid stenosis with atrial fibrillation causes a mid-diastolic murmur. (See <a href=\"#H41\" class=\"local\">'Tricuspid stenosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H48\" class=\"local\">'Tricuspid stenosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A myxoma causes a mid- or late-diastolic murmur.
