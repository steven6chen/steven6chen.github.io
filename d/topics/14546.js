Observations in favor of this theory include the recovery of bile acids from the skin surface of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], although the reliability of the methods used to detect the bile acids is uncertain. Other studies have found that administering bile acids can induce pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>However, there are three observations that are not consistent with a primary role for bile acids as the cause of pruritus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The occasional subsidence of pruritus despite ongoing cholestasis and persistence of elevated plasma bile acid levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of pruritus in many patients with cholestasis and elevated plasma bile acid levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The apparent lack of correlation between the presence or severity of pruritus and concentrations of bile acids in skin of patients with chronic cholestasis in the most carefully done study that investigated this question [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p/><p>Furthermore, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colestipol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colestipol</a>, agents used to treat the pruritus of cholestasis, also ameliorate pruritus in patients with uremia and polycythemia vera, conditions not associated with bile salt retention. (See <a href=\"#H71723711\" class=\"local\">'Bile acid sequestrants'</a> below.)</p><p>A related hypothesis implicates elevated plasma bile acids via hepatocyte toxicity, rather than their effect on nerve endings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The detergent bile acids alter hepatocyte membranes, permitting the leakage of hepatocyte contents (some of which are pruritogens) into the bloodstream.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Endogenous opioids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is increasing evidence for an important role for endogenous opioids in the pathogenesis of cholestatic pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The administration of opioid drugs with agonist activity at the mu opioid receptor can produce pruritus in normal individuals, presumably by a central action. More importantly, endogenous opioid levels are elevated (via an uncertain mechanism) in patients with chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], and many reports have shown a reduction in cholestatic pruritus in patients treated with opioid antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/12,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15-17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H71723952\" class=\"local\">'Opioid antagonists'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Lysophosphatidic acid and autotaxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies suggest an important role for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in cholestatic pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. LPA is a phospholipid that is formed by the action of autotaxin, which cleaves a choline group from lysophosphatidylcholine. In one study, compared with controls, patients with cholestatic pruritus had significantly increased serum concentrations of LPA and autotaxin activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, injection of LPA induced a scratch response in mice. These observations need confirmation but suggest a potential role for inhibition of autotaxin as therapeutic strategy. (See <a href=\"#H71723914\" class=\"local\">'Rifampin'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71722306\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pruritus in patients with cholestasis may be generalized or localized (particularly to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The intensity of the pruritus is variable and it can wax and wane spontaneously. The severity does not correlate with the severity of the underlying liver disease. Pruritus is often worse at night and may be exacerbated by psychologic stress. Women who are premenstrual may also experience a worsening of symptoms. Cool temperatures often lead to improvement. Long-standing scratching may result in excoriations, folliculitis, prurigo nodularis, and lichenification. </p><p>Pruritus can have a profound effect on a patient's quality of life, resulting in sleep deprivation and emotional disturbances (including suicidal ideation in some patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Quantifying the severity of pruritus can be difficult but is important when evaluating the efficacy of medical therapy. Investigators have developed a scratching activity monitoring system that allows for recording of scratching behavior independent from gross body movement, thereby allowing for the inclusion of behavioral methodology in clinical trials of pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nevertheless, clinical trials have generally been small and used varying scales for measuring pruritus limiting comparison among them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71722320\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for causes of pruritus is long. However, a presumptive diagnosis of cholestasis-associated pruritus can be made in a patient with cholestasis who complains of itching. An extensive evaluation is generally not required, provided the cause of the cholestasis is known, though patients should have a skin examination to look for evidence of dermatologic disorders associated with pruritus (eg, atopic dermatitis or contact dermatitis). In addition, uremic pruritus should be considered in patients with end-stage renal disease. If the cause of the cholestasis is not known, the patient should undergo additional evaluation with laboratory tests and imaging studies.

It may lessen with the development of end-stage liver disease. It may also improve with time in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (previously referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis). In women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, pruritus often worsens as the pregnancy progresses and then typically resolves within a few days of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Some patients develop severe, refractory pruritus requiring liver transplantation.

We start with a low dose (eg, 200 to 300 mg daily) and then over the next few weeks gradually increase the dose to 13 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day given in two to three divided doses.

However, the use of these medications in the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis is controversial, and we do not currently recommend colchicine or methotrexate for the treatment of pruritus in patients with primary biliary cholangitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;, section on 'Controversial approaches'</a>.)</p><p>Treatment in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy must take into account potential adverse effects of the treatment on the fetus. UDCA has been studied in women with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and is well-tolerated and safe. Its use has been associated with relief of pruritus, decreased levels of endogenous bile acids, normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels, and improved fetal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cholestyramine</a> and antihistamines are often ineffective and are not well tolerated in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/2,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,23</a>].

The effective dose of cholestyramine ranges from 4 to 16 grams per day. Treatment typically begins with two 4-gram doses daily, with additional doses being added if needed. In patients who are also taking UDCA, bile acid sequestrants should be given two to four hours before or after ingestion of UDCA. Efficacy may be increased by administering a dose before and a dose after breakfast in patients with an intact gallbladder to enhance the excretion of the pruritogens, which presumably accumulate in the gallbladder during the overnight fast. If symptoms persist, the dose can be titrated upward by giving a dose after lunch and, if needed, a dose after dinner.</p><p>These drugs are nonabsorbable, basic polystyrenes that bind anions in the gut lumen, including bile acids. They lower bile acid levels by inhibiting the reabsorption of bile acids by approximately 90 percent. However, binding of bile acids alone is unlikely to explain their benefit, since a potent bile acid sequestrant (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=colesevelam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colesevelam</a>) was not effective for cholestatic pruritus in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. They also decrease pruritus in noncholestatic disorders, such as uremia and polycythemia vera, suggesting that these resins bind other pruritogens. This may in part be due to the induction of cholecystokinin release, which is an endogenous anti-opioid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>There have been few randomized trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a> for cholestasis-associated pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

It is given as 150 to 300 mg twice daily. In a meta-analysis of five randomized crossover trials with 61 patients, during treatment with rifampin, 47 patients (77 percent) reported complete or partial resolution of pruritus, whereas 12 patients (20 percent) reported complete or partial resolution of pruritus while receiving placebo or alternative medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> is a potent agonist of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), which mediates many detoxification and hepatobiliary processes.
