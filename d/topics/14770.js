Although most clinical studies have not differentiated between the two histologies, an increasing amount of evidence supports the view that they differ in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology, tumor biology, and prognosis. In acknowledgement of these differences, the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system provides separate stage groupings (but similar definitions for T, N, M, and grade [G] categories) for SCCs and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>). In addition, tumor location (for SCCs only) is incorporated into stage grouping. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-esophageal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of esophageal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, it remains unclear as to whether and how histology should dictate the therapeutic approach, and largely due to the lack of data on the impact of histology on treatment outcomes, the approach tends to be similar for both histologies, at least initially. However, pathologic complete response rates are higher in SCC following chemoradiotherapy, and if an endoscopic complete response is achieved, non-operative management is an option following initial chemoradiotherapy. By contrast, few data exist on the adequacy of nonoperative management for adenocarcinomas, and most patients are recommended to undergo surgery after upfront chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Necessity for surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Future studies in esophageal cancer should analyze and report separately the results of therapeutic strategies according to histology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607555500\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increasing amount of evidence supports the view that esophageal SCC and adenocarcinomas differ in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology, tumor biology, and prognosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of SCC is declining in the United States while that of adenocarcinoma has increased markedly over the last 20 years, suggesting underlying etiologic differences. SCC is almost always the result of tobacco <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alcohol abuse while adenocarcinomas are associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and high body mass.

In contrast, adenocarcinomas usually arise as a consequence of persistent GERD, in which the mucosa of the distal esophagus undergoes intestinal metaplasia. Carcinogenesis begins with genetic alterations which endow the metaplastic cells with a growth advantage, permitting them to hyperproliferate. As the cells progressively acquire DNA damage, they become morphologically dysplastic, and eventually, frankly malignant.

Modern radiation techniques (eg, three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy [3D-CRT], intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT]) are associated with more favorable toxicity profiles than those associated with the lower energy units used in earlier years. The success of advanced radiation technology can be illustrated by a Chinese trial in which surgery was compared with RT alone in 269 patients with esophageal squamous cell cancer (SCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-chemoradiotherapy-neoadjuvant-approaches-and-postoperative-adjuvant-therapy-for-localized-cancers-of-the-esophagus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

For primary tumors involving the upper two-thirds of the thoracic or the cervical esophagus, CTV includes both supraclavicular regions. It is necessary to add another 0.5 to 0.7 cm beyond CTV as the PTV (planning target volume) in order to compensate for daily set-up error and respiratory tumor motion.</p><p>Esophageal cancers that are located at the EGJ can have a significant degree of tumor motion associated with respiration.

The typical interval, four to seven weeks, is arbitrary, with the intent of allowing resolution of acute inflammation and allowing for tumor regression while minimizing the chronic fibrotic changes in the surgical field. Most tumors regress slowly after RT because one of the ways in which the cells die is through mitotic death that occurs only during cell division. Increasing the interval between treatment completion and attempted resection may allow the tumor to continue to regress, thereby improving resectability, and increase the chance of observing a pCR.

If surgery is performed, it usually requires removal of portions of the pharynx, the larynx, the thyroid gland, and portions of the proximal esophagus. In addition, radical neck dissections are usually carried out; as such, the management is more closely related to SCC of the head and neck than for malignancies involving the more distal portions of the esophagus. In general, radiation therapy (RT) combined with chemotherapy is preferred over surgery for proximal esophageal cancers where laryngectomy would be necessary for a good cancer operation since survival appears to be comparable and major morbidity is avoided in most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-chemoradiotherapy-neoadjuvant-approaches-and-postoperative-adjuvant-therapy-for-localized-cancers-of-the-esophagus/abstract/144-146\" class=\"abstract_t\">144-146</a>].

The majority of patients now undergo some form of combined modality therapy rather than local therapy alone. However, the optimal management of these patients remains controversial. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two major histologies of esophageal cancer: squamous cell cancer (SCC) and adenocarcinoma. Although most clinical studies have not differentiated between these two tumor entities, an increasing amount of evidence supports the view that they differ in terms of their pathogenesis, epidemiology, tumor biology, and prognosis. In recognition of these differences, the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging criteria provides separate stage groupings for SCC and adenocarcinomas of the esophagus and EGJ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, it remains unclear whether and how histology should be used to select the treatment approach, and largely due to the lack of data on the impact of histology on treatment outcomes, the approach tends to be similar for both histologies. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Squamous cell versus adenocarcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8182417\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracic esophageal cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following conclusions regarding therapy can be derived from phase III studies comparing definitive chemoradiotherapy with radiotherapy alone, and preoperative chemoradiotherapy or preoperative chemotherapy with surgery alone for patients with thoracic esophageal cancer that is localized to the primary site and regional nodes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend combined modality therapy, rather than surgery alone, for patients with T3N0, T4aN0, and clinically node-positive thoracic esophageal cancer, regardless of histology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We suggest concurrent chemoradiotherapy instead of chemotherapy alone for neoadjuvant therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2246457340\" class=\"local\">'Clinical T3-4 or node-positive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many clinicians also treat esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and proximal gastric (ie, cardia, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56689\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56689 \">figure 1</a>)) cancers with preoperative chemoradiotherapy as well. However, these tumors have been included in many of the trials examining the benefit of perioperative chemotherapy alone for gastric cancer, and this is also a widely accepted approach. The specific therapeutic approach to tumors of the EGJ is addressed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multimodality-approaches-to-potentially-resectable-esophagogastric-junction-and-gastric-cardia-adenocarcinomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multimodality approaches to potentially resectable esophagogastric junction and gastric cardia adenocarcinomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the optimal type, dose, combination, and schedule of drugs has not been definitively established, we suggest the low-dose weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68266\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68266 \">table 3</a>) as was used in the Dutch CROSS trial rather than two courses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) as was used in CALGB 9781 (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1782684873\" class=\"local\">'Versus RT alone'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-protocols-for-esophagogastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment protocols for esophagogastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal dose-fractionation RT schedule for concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimens remains to be determined. However, three-dimensional conformal techniques should be used for modern treatment planning to minimize toxicities to adjacent vital organs (ie, heart, lung, spinal cord, or liver). Even though the Dutch CROSS trial used a lower dose (41.4 Gy), the standard dose of RT for patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy remains 50.4 Gy administered in 28 daily fractions, as was used in CALGB 9781 and RTOG 85-01. (See <a href=\"#H1782684873\" class=\"local\">'Versus RT alone'</a> above and <a href=\"#H775527435\" class=\"local\">'Optimal dose and fractionation schedules'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive chemoradiotherapy is a reasonable approach for patients who are not surgical candidates. For patients who are potential surgical candidates who have SCC and an endoscopically-documented complete response, definitive chemoradiotherapy is also an option. However, while nonoperative management avoids the risks of surgical morbidity and mortality, this benefit must be weighed against the lower likelihood of locoregional control without resection. Given the higher rate of locally <span class=\"nowrap\">persistent/recurrent</span> disease after chemoradiotherapy alone and a lack of data on nonsurgical management of patients with adenocarcinoma, who have a low rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) after chemoradiotherapy, inclusion of surgery is preferred for clinically resectable esophageal cancer, particularly for adenocarcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Necessity for surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For chemoradiotherapy nonresponders, surgery should be considered for those who are still operable after chemoradiotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H3947323922\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy nonresponders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Until further data are available, we suggest against use of postchemoradiotherapy fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning to identify those patients for whom surgery might be avoided (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20504361\" class=\"local\">'Utility of postinduction therapy PET scans'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefit of preoperative chemoradiotherapy for patients with clinical stage T2N0 tumors is less clear. Nevertheless, these patients were included in three trials that demonstrated a survival benefit for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and we suggest combined modality therapy rather than resection alone for patients with an adenocarcinoma (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Initial resection is an option for T2N0 SCCs. (See <a href=\"#H1697036435\" class=\"local\">'Clinical T2N0 disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with T1N0 esophageal or EGJ adenocarcinoma or SCC, we recommend surgery alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Definitive chemoradiotherapy is a reasonable approach for patients who are not surgical candidates. (See <a href=\"#H3630025068\" class=\"local\">'Clinical T1N0 disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with completely resected esophageal cancer who have not received neoadjuvant therapy, we suggest postoperative adjuvant therapy for patients with node-positive or node-negative, pathologic T3 or pT4 adenocarcinomas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In keeping with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, we also suggest adjuvant therapy for selected patients with high-risk, resected pathologic T2N0 adenocarcinomas, including those with poorly differentiated histology, with lymphovascular or perineural invasion, and that arise in patients who are younger than age 50. Chemotherapy alone and chemoradiotherapy are both reasonable options. We only offer postoperative therapy to patients with SCC if the resection margins are positive. (See <a href=\"#H484837\" class=\"local\">'Role of postoperative adjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8182671\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical esophageal cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of carcinoma arising in the cervical esophagus is more closely related to SCC of the head and neck than for malignancies involving the more distal portions of the esophagus.
