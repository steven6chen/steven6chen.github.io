The incidence of endometrial carcinoma (EC) is increasing in developed countries due to increased obesity and longer life expectancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.) </p><p>The standard initial treatment of EC is hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and assessment of retroperitoneal lymph nodes. This is an acceptable option for the majority of women with EC, most of whom are postmenopausal. However, younger women may desire fertility-sparing treatment options. For women who are candidates for fertility preservation, the most common approach is progestin therapy and deferral of surgical staging until after completion of childbearing. Use of this approach is limited to women with low-risk disease, and with fertility preservation the risk of recurrent or persistent disease is higher than with hysterectomy. </p><p>Fertility preservation in women with EC is reviewed here.

Even in patients with clinical stage I disease, there is a moderate risk of extrauterine disease with grade &gt;1 tumors. There is also a risk of an undetected synchronous ovarian cancer, and the lack of a tumor specimen may limit detection of Lynch syndrome.</p><p>The risk of a synchronous ovarian cancer may be as high as 25 percent in young women, though the data to inform risk are sparse. For example, in one study of 102 women younger than 45 years of age with EC who were presumed early stage, 26 patients (25 percent) had a coexisting ovarian malignancy upon surgical staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Nearly half of these women had well-differentiated tumors with less than 50 percent myometrial invasion, suggesting that lower-risk endometrial cancer does not preclude a coexisting ovarian malignancy. </p><p>Young women who are diagnosed with EC may have Lynch syndrome as the underlying etiology of their cancer. All women with EC should be referred for genetic testing if the family history is suggestive of this condition. Lynch syndrome is an inherited genetic mutation in mismatch repair (MMR) genes inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Women with Lynch syndrome are at an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. Fertility-sparing therapy may limit the identification of women with Lynch syndrome, since molecular screening of tumor specimens is another important way patients with Lynch syndrome are identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H22213909\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Tumor evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1952742641\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTION OF CANDIDATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Candidates for fertility-sparing therapy for EC are women with early-stage, low-grade disease and with no poor prognostic factors. </p><p>A clinical challenge is that women who are managed with a fertility-sparing approach are incompletely staged. The standard approach to EC staging is surgical exploration with total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, while women who proceed with fertility preservation do not undergo surgical staging. Thus, stage is determined by clinical assessment with physical examination and imaging, but more advanced disease may be present. In addition, grade is determined by endometrial sampling, but this may be upgraded once the entire endometrium is evaluated at the time of hysterectomy. </p><p>The best available data regarding the rate of unsuspected advanced disease in women presumed to be stage I based on clinical evaluation are from a study of 621 women with EC, among whom 22 percent were found to have disease outside the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The rate of nodal metastases increased with increasing tumor grade (grade 1: 3 percent; grade 2: 9 percent; grade 3: 18 percent). This seminal study, with its recognition of the potential for metastatic spread, prompted the shift from a clinical staging to a surgical staging of EC, although admittedly in an older patient population who were not candidates for fertility preservation. Subsequent studies have found a low risk of difference in the findings of frozen section versus permanent section of the uterus in EC and the identification of factors associated with a low risk for nodal metastases (well-differentiated endometrioid tumor with lack of myometrial invasion and small size) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. While these studies are reassuring regarding basing management on clinical staging and endometrial sampling, assessment of risk is based on uterine histopathologic factors, which will not be determined definitively if the uterus is preserved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1038390856\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal candidates for fertility-sparing treatment of EC include women with the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Well-differentiated (grade 1) endometrial adenocarcinoma with histology and grade confirmed on dilation and curettage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor confined to the endometrium, stage IA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113543 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reproductive-age and desirous of future childbearing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No contraindications to hormonal therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understanding of the nonstandard nature of treatment, including risk of occult cancer, risk of recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent cancer</p><p/><p>While there are reports of women with grade 2 to 3 differentiated tumors with superficial myometrial invasion, the collective experience is insufficient to recommend fertility-sparing progestin therapy for this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In one study of 621 patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer, those with grade 1 cancer limited to the endometrium had a 0 percent incidence of extrauterine spread at the time of surgical staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the overall incidence of extrauterine spread in the study was higher, with 22 percent of patients having disease outside of the uterus (lymph node metastasis, adnexal disease, intraperitoneal spread, and <span class=\"nowrap\">or/malignant</span> cells in peritoneal washings). A large database study found comparable efficacy for progestin therapy and surgery in women with stage IA disease, but lesser progestin efficacy in stage IB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These data underscore the importance of patient selection for fertility-sparing treatment based on grade and depth of invasion, even among patients without clinical evidence for extrauterine spread.</p><p>For women with Lynch syndrome, tumorigenesis is secondary to a defect in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, not excessive estrogen stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Based on the difference in pathogenesis from the general population and the lack of studies of response to progestins in women with Lynch syndrome, in our practice, we do not offer fertility to preservation to women with EC who have Lynch syndrome.

(See <a href=\"#H2014726472\" class=\"local\">'Risks of fertility preservation'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients should be counseled preoperatively regarding their potential future reproductive outcomes. Some data suggest that appropriate preoperative counseling for women with gynecologic malignancies undergoing fertility-sparing surgery is associated with a decreased risk of posttreatment regret [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2833776612\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pretreatment evaluation consists of clinical determination of stage and grade as well as evaluation for a synchronous primary malignancy.

For women who desire fertility-sparing treatment for EC, we suggest endometrial sampling by dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) rather than by office endometrial biopsy alone. Office endometrial biopsy is an effective method for diagnosing EC (sensitivity, 99.6 percent in postmenopausal and 91 percent in premenopausal women with the Pipelle device in a meta-analysis of 39 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]), but some observational data suggest that D&amp;C is associated with a better diagnostic performance for grade of disease and a lower rate of residual disease on subsequent hysterectomy. This may be because office endometrial biopsy is less effective at sampling focal rather than global lesions; thus, areas of pathology may be missed. In women who desire fertility preservation, the detection of grade 2 disease or higher is of the utmost importance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease&quot;, section on 'Invasive methods'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic performance of D&amp;C compared with office endometrial biopsy was illustrated in a retrospective study (n = 490) of women with a preoperative grade 1 EC who underwent hysterectomy and found that final pathology was upgraded in significantly more women with an initial office endometrial biopsy compared with D&amp;C (17.4 versus 8.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, fewer women in the office biopsy group had no residual tumor at hysterectomy (3.7 versus 14.8 percent), but the study did not report tests of statistical significance for this outcome. High-risk histologies (eg, serous, clear cell) were identified after hysterectomy in approximately 1 percent of women in each sampling method group.</p><p>After confirming low-grade endometrioid EC with D&amp;C, pelvic imaging should be performed to evaluate for myometrial invasion. In our practice, we use MRI for this evaluation. MRI is an effective modality for detection of myometrial invasion. As an example, in one study (n = 101), MRI detected myometrial invasion and cervical invasion with a sensitivity of 89 and specificity of 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another study (n = 65), for detection of superficial myometrial invasion, MRI had both a sensitivity and specificity of 74 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Studies have been inconsistent regarding whether MRI is superior to ultrasound in detecting myometrial invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]; however, MRI can also be used to assess locoregional disease spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>], including cervical extension and deep myometrial invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. MRI has been demonstrated to be superior to computed tomography (CT) in that regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A finding on MRI of enlarged lymph nodes and those with central necrosis should be considered suspicious for metastatic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1949049226\"><span class=\"h1\">FERTILITY-SPARING THERAPY OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progestin therapy is the mainstay of fertility preservation in EC. Other types of medications, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or aromatase inhibitors, have been proposed, but there are few data regarding their efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Surgical resection of the endometrium has also been proposed as part of a fertility preservation approach, but this approach is investigational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2963525734\"><span class=\"h2\">Progestin therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several different types of progestins, doses, and regimens may be used for treatment of EC. Progestins are typically given orally (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> [MPA], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> [MA]) or via an intrauterine device (IUD). Historically, the most commonly used oral agents have been MPA or MA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. There are few high-quality data to establish the optimal type of progestin, route of administration, or dose.</p><p>The data regarding the efficacy and toxicity of progestin therapy are limited. Available data include a prospective, multicenter phase II study; meta-analyses of observational studies (mostly retrospective); a large national database study; and small series or case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>The largest individual study of this issue reaffirmed the practice of limiting progestin therapy to women with stage IA disease. The study used data from a United States cancer database and included over 23,000 women &lt;50 years-old with stage I endometrioid endometrial cancer diagnosed from 2004 to 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Progestin therapy was given in 872 women; the study did not report route or dose of the progestin regimens. Patients treated with progestins compared with hysterectomy had a lower five-year survival rate (96.4 versus 97.2 percent) and higher mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.92, 95% CI 1.15-3.19). Subset analysis by stage showed that progestin therapy was associated with increased mortality in women with stage IB (HR 3.52, 95% CI 1.57-7.90) and I-not otherwise specified tumors, but not for stage IA disease (HR 1.20, 95% CI 0.53-2.68). Comparing five-year survival by type of treatment, women with stage IA disease had equivalent outcomes (97.5 in both treatment groups), but survival was lower with progestins in stage IB (75.0 versus 97.5 percent). </p><p>Studies have included different doses, agents, and regimens. Most of the studies have evaluated oral progestins, and there are no studies that directly compare oral progestins with a progestin-releasing IUD for EC. Another limitation is that many studies include both women with EC and those with endometrial hyperplasia. In addition, definitions of response, progression, and recurrence and the duration of follow-up vary across studies.

Optimal candidates include women with the following characteristics (See <a href=\"#H1038390856\" class=\"local\">'Selection criteria'</a> above.):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Well-differentiated (grade 1) endometrial adenocarcinoma with histology and grade confirmed on dilation and curettage (D&amp;C)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tumor confined to the endometrium</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reproductive-age and desirous of future childbearing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No contraindications to hormonal therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Understanding of the nonstandard nature of treatment, including risk of occult cancer, risk of recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent cancer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pretreatment evaluation for women considering fertility-sparing therapy includes: medical history, physical examination to assess uterus (size, mobility) and for metastatic disease, endometrial sampling, and pelvic and abdominal imaging. For women who desire fertility-sparing treatment of EC, we suggest endometrial sampling by D&amp;C rather than by office endometrial biopsy alone. (See <a href=\"#H2833776612\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progestin therapy is the mainstay of fertility preservation in EC. Other types of medications, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or aromatase inhibitors, have been proposed, but there are few data regarding their efficacy. Surgical resection of the endometrium has also been proposed as part of a fertility preservation approach, but this approach is investigational. (See <a href=\"#H1949049226\" class=\"local\">'Fertility-sparing therapy options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete response rates with progestin therapy range from 70 to 80 percent. There is no consensus regarding the optimal progestin agent or dose. For women with EC who meet the criteria for fertility preservation, we suggest treatment with the LNg20 in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> (MA) (we use 80 mg, oral, daily) rather than a progestin-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) or oral progestin alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2963525734\" class=\"local\">'Progestin therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After progestin therapy is initiated, an office endometrial biopsy is performed in three months. (See <a href=\"#H1310215351\" class=\"local\">'Clinical protocol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have a complete response, we repeat an office endometrial biopsy in three months. After two consecutive negative biopsies, we encourage the patient to pursue pregnancy as soon as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with persistence of disease at three months, we increase the dose of the oral progestin (eg, MA 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. If a patient was treated initially with a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD alone, an oral progestin should be added. An office endometrial biopsy is performed again after three months of the change in therapy. Patients with persistence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progression after nine to twelve months of progestin therapy are unlikely to respond and should be counseled appropriately, including being offered a hysterectomy.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/corp.html (Accessed on June 06, 2016).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lee NK, Cheung MK, Shin JY, et al.
