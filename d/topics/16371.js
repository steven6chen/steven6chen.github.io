Above the age of 30 years, this amounts to an average decrease of 0.7 to 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Once renal injury has occurred, independent of etiology, the decline in GFR can be accelerated by hypertension, proteinuria, and possibly by dyslipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The rate of decline in GFR in established chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be decelerated with early intervention. Perhaps the most successful intervention is the reduction of elevated blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and there may be an added benefit to using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), particularly in those with significant proteinuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In animals, dyslipidemia is causally associated with glomerular injury, leading to the development of glomerulosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. However, this does not correlate with human studies in which lipid-rich conditions, such as familial hyperlipidemia, do not seem to lead to clinically relevant renal injury. Perhaps this is due to earlier development of significant cardiovascular disease or targeted interventional therapy. On the other hand, once CKD has been established, small series have demonstrated an association between progression of renal disease and hyperlipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Secondary analyses of data on subsets of patients with decreased kidney function recruited into several trials of hypertensive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dyslipidemic cohorts have helped to clarify some of these issues. However, in interpreting these post-hoc analyses, it is important to exercise considerable caution as renal dysfunction was not the primary objective of the studies and significant inaccuracies may accrue as a result of subanalysis, with increased risk of type I errors. In addition, the evaluation of renal function in these post-hoc analyses typically is done using formulaic manipulation of plasma creatinine levels, with all of the obvious shortcomings of this methodology.</p><p>The evidence linking dyslipidemia management with statins to the decline in renal function will be presented in this topic review. Additional reasons for the use of statins in those with renal disease, including an overview of its possible benefits in decreasing the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, will also be presented briefly. Overviews of the use of statins in patients without renal failure are presented separately.

The reasons for increased stiffness in renal failure patients are diverse and include both functional and structural alterations, some of which are also seen with older age and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Beneficial effects of statins on vessel stiffening and endothelial function in renal failure have been described.

Baseline and 6, 12, and 36 monthly endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) and other measures of the brachial artery were measured. A significant decrease in total and low-density cholesterol was observed after 6, 12, and 36 months in patients treated with fluvastatin but not in the placebo group. In addition, there was a concomitant increase in FMD with fluvastatin after 12 months; this improvement was sustained at 13.4 percent after 36 months. Other differences between the two groups were not observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study that examined large artery stiffness in type 2 diabetics on hemodialysis, 22 patients with normal serum lipids were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvastatin</a> 20 mg daily or placebo for a total of six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Serum lipid levels, serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and measures of arterial stiffness (arterial pulse wave velocity [PWV] and ankle brachial indexes [ABI]) were determined at baseline, three, and six months after taking the medication. After six months, the placebo-treated arm demonstrated a significant increase in the PWV and the serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In contrast, the active treatment arm had a significantly reduced PWV, oxidized LDL-C serum levels, and CRP (from 0.97 to 0.26 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> compared with those in the placebo group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With respect to endothelial function, 60 normotensive patients with type 2 diabetes, moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;), and dyslipidemia received either cerivastatin or placebo for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Cerivastatin significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides levels, and urinary albumin excretion, suggesting that modifications of endothelial function by statins may be important in modulating glomerular proteinuria. There are other short-term statin-administration trials that purport to show reductions in urinary albumin excretion, but considerable caution should be exercised here as this is not a completely reliable surrogate endpoint for important renal outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammation and end-stage renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is growing evidence for an anti-inflammatory role for statins in patients without renal failure.

Cholesterol, albumin, and high-sensitivity CRP were measured at baseline and again at eight weeks. Unlike the control group, in which there was no change in these markers, active therapy significantly reduced total cholesterol levels (232 to 165 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and high-sensitivity CRP levels (0.23 to 0.12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and increased serum albumin levels (3.4 to 3.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span>.</p><p>A beneficial effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> on inflammatory markers (CRP, interleukin [IL] 6) was also reported in a randomized study of 55 patients with CKD not on dialysis (mean creatinine clearance 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>These results are suggestive that, in addition to its lipid-lowering effects, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> has an anti-inflammatory effect in patients with CKD.

Once renal injury has occurred, the yearly decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may be accelerated and perpetuated by dyslipidemia. However, the supportive data were largely derived from post-hoc analyses of several large trials, which may be limited by unmeasured confounders.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Helsinki Heart Study recruited 2702 dyslipidemic (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] &gt;5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> men with &quot;normal renal function&quot; (defined as serum creatinine concentration &lt;1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [115 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> although 30 men were included with levels between 1.3 and 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (116 and 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

At five years of follow-up, mean serum creatinine levels had increased an average of 3 percent in both groups (an increase of approximately 5 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. A low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to HDL ratio &gt;4.4 was associated with a 20 percent faster decline than a ratio &lt;3.2, a result that remained significant despite multiple regression analyses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Physicians' Health Study recruited and monitored 4483 healthy men between 1982 and 1996 with predefined primary endpoints of an elevated serum creatinine level (defined as &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> and reduced estimated creatinine clearance (defined as &lt;55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

After 14 years, 134 men (3 percent) had elevated serum creatinine levels, and 244 (5.4 percent) had reduced creatinine clearance. Dyslipidemia was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing renal dysfunction in men, with an initial creatinine concentration of &lt;133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> (relative risk [RR] 1.68 for total cholesterol &gt;240 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> 2.12 for HDL &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> 2.22 for the highest quartile of total <span class=\"nowrap\">cholesterol/HDL</span> ratio [&gt;6.8], and 2.03 for the highest quartile of non-HDL-C [&gt;196.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p>However, other studies have not shown an association between lipids and progression of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. As an example, an analysis of patients enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study showed no association between total cholesterol, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), LDL-C, HDL-C, apoA-I, apo B or lipoprotein(a), and decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Unexpectedly, among a subset of patients with low levels of proteinuria (&lt;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> higher total and LDL-C were associated with lower risks of progression of kidney disease. Underlying reasons for this observation are not known but may include residual confounding by unaccounted vascular risk factors after multivariable adjustment was made.</p><p>The effect of unmeasured confounders that are closely correlated to dyslipidemia have been observed in other post-hoc analyses. As an example, in a post-hoc analysis of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], the observed temporal association between hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C and an increase in serum creatinine concentration was considerably attenuated after adjustment for measures of insulin resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">STATINS AND KIDNEY FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have evaluated the effect of statin therapy on renal outcomes in patients with CKD.

Urinary protein excretion varies directly with the intraglomerular pressure, and lowering intraglomerular pressure with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) is at least a partial explanation for their benefit in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Proteinuria may also directly contribute to disease progression. This observation suggests that lowering proteinuria alone, independent of any reduction in intraglomerular pressure or systemic blood pressure, may diminish renal damage. In addition, proteinuria is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Proteinuria'</a>.)</p><p>Analyses of the first postmarketing year reported to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) showed different rates of increased protein excretion with various statins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Higher rates were observed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> than with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a>. However, clinical studies that specifically evaluated the effect of statin therapy on protein excretion yielded conflicting results, with some demonstrating a reduction in proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>] and others showing no effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Two meta-analyses using similar criteria for trial inclusion synthesized the results from small, randomized trials (ranging from 18 to 82 patients) that, as a secondary outcome, evaluated the effect of statin use on albuminuria or proteinuria; trial inclusion into these two meta-analyses was similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33</a>]. The first meta-analysis of 382 patients reported a significant 48 percent reduction in albumin excretion with statin therapy in patients with moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;; 30 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> and those with severely increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;macroalbuminuria&quot;; &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The second meta-analysis of 311 patients reported a significant mean absolute reduction in albumin excretion of 730 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> a result that was probably driven by findings in patients with severely increased albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In only one of the trials included in these meta-analyses was the use of angiotensin blockers uniform, while at least four of the included trials employed no angiotensin blockers.</p><p>Three subsequent, largescale, randomized trials found no effect of statins on albumin excretion in patients who received optimal therapy for slowing CKD progression with angiotensin blockers and good blood pressure control:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the PREVEND-IT trial, 864 patients with a urinary albumin excretion between 15 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and a mean blood pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">130/76</span> mmHg at baseline were randomly assigned in a 2x2 factorial design to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a> or placebo and to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosinopril</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/statins-and-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The PLANET I study cohort included patients with type 1 (14.5 percent) or type 2 (85.5 percent) diabetes mellitus with well-preserved kidney function (serum creatinine approximately 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [100 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L];</span> estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] approximately 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) but prominent proteinuria (approximately 136 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol</span> creatinine) or albuminuria (90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol</span> creatinine).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Participants had a baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level of approximately 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> for which more than half were receiving lipid-modifying drugs before randomization, and all were receiving treatment with a renin&ndash;angiotensin system blocker. A total of 353 patients were randomly assigned to the three blinded-treatment groups. The within-group findings showed that the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) was significantly lower at all time points than at baseline in those who received 80 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a>, whereas no significant changes in UPCR were observed in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> groups. These data, however, should not be interpreted as suggesting that atorvastatin is more renoprotective than rosuvastatin. Such &quot;before and after&quot; comparisons suffer from many biases and provide a weak test of any drug's true effects. The more reliable between-group comparisons showed no marked difference in the change in UPCR between the atorvastatin and rosuvastatin groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To increase the statistical power of the more robust between-group assessments of the two statins, the investigators combined the data from PLANET I with the data from PLANET II, useful only for hypothesis generation. The data suggested that 80 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> might reduce UPCR to a greater extent than either 10 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> (-15.6 percent, p<em> </em>= 0.043) or 40 mg rosuvastatin (-18.2 percent, p<em> </em>= 0.013), but the p<em> </em>values are barely significant given the number of comparisons performed. The lack of a placebo control group in either trial makes it difficult to judge whether rosuvastatin is increasing proteinuria, atorvastatin is reducing proteinuria, or both effects are happening.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H156847721\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on chronic kidney disease progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting data concerning the effect of statins on progression of CKD.
