The organism is capable of multiplying in tissues and producing several enzymes that induce inflammation and abscesses. Many strains produce exotoxins that lead to three associated syndromes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food poisoning, caused by ingestion of <em>S. aureus</em> enterotoxin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scalded skin syndrome, caused by exfoliative toxin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toxic shock syndrome (TSS), caused by toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and other enterotoxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]</p><p/><p>Toxic shock syndrome was initially described in 1978 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; the disease came to public attention in 1980 with the occurrence of a series of menstrual-associated cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The majority of clinically reported cases of TSS have been due to methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em> (MSSA). Cases of TSS due to methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) have also emerged as rates of infection due to MRSA have increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of staphylococcal TSS will be reviewed here. Other issues related to staphylococcal infection are discussed separately. (See related topics.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) associated with <em>S. aureus</em> was first described in a series of pediatric cases in 1978 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In 1980, the incidence rose sharply; 812 documented cases of menses-related TSS occurred, largely among young Caucasian women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Clinical illness arose during menstruation and was associated with the use of absorbent tampons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. The incidence of TSS declined sharply after the withdrawal of some tampon brands.</p><p>Subsequently, between 2000 and 2003, the incidence rose slightly; in one report, the incidence increased from 0.8 to 3.4 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These cases occurred among women of menstrual age but included both menstrual and nonmenstrual cases. They may have represented increased recognition due to active laboratory testing for toxin-producing strains rather than an overall increase in incidence. A study conducted in the Minneapolis area from 2000 to 2006 noted a stable incidence of staphylococcal TSS overall, with a decreasing annual incidence of menstrual TSS among women &gt;24 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similarly, a review of patients diagnosed with TSS among Colorado hospitals demonstrated no significant change in the incidence of staphylococcal TSS between 1993 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Menstrual cases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 5300 cases of TSS were reported between 1979 and 1996; underreporting is probable, especially in nonmenstrual cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The proportion of cases associated with menstruation has decreased significantly over time (91 percent between 1979 and 1980 versus 59 percent between 1987 and 1996).</p><p>The number of cases of menstrual TSS has declined, from 9 in 100,000 women in 1980 to 1 in 100,000 women since 1986 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The case-fatality rate for menstrual TSS has also declined (from 5.5 percent between 1979 and 1980 to 1.8 percent between 1987 and 1996) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The withdrawal of highly absorbent tampons and polyacrylate rayon-containing products from the market partially explains the decrease in menstrual cases; however, tampon use remains a risk factor for TSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Women who develop TSS are more likely to have used tampons with high absorbency, used tampons continuously for more days of their cycle, and kept a single tampon in place for a longer period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonmenstrual</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately half of reported TSS cases are not related to menstruation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>]. Nonmenstrual TSS has been observed in a variety of clinical situations, including surgical and postpartum wound infections, mastitis, septorhinoplasty, sinusitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, burns, cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions (especially of the extremities, perianal area, and axillae), respiratory infections following influenza, and enterocolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>]. Between 1979 and 1996, the proportion of cases following surgical procedures increased from 14 percent to 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In one report including cases of TSS between 1979 and 1996, 93 percent occurred among women and 73 percent of nonmenstrual cases occurred among women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, one study including 130 cases noted that the gender distribution was equal with exclusion of vaginal and postpartum-associated cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients with nonmenstrual TSS are older (mean age 27 versus 23 years) and more often nonwhite than patients with menstrual TSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/19,25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,25,29</a>]. The case-fatality rate for nonmenstrual TSS was 5 percent in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another study of 61 TSS cases occurring in Minnesota between 2000 and 2006, there were 28 nonmenstrual cases; of these, no primary source was identified in 36 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>TSS also occurs in children; between 1979 and 1996, 50 cases among children &lt;5 years of age were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Children &lt;2 years accounted for approximately half of these cases, and 62 percent had antecedent cutaneous lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Methicillin-resistant S. aureus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) strains are capable of producing toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), and patients infected with these strains may develop TSS. In a series including 30 patients with TSST-1&ndash;positive MRSA infections from France and Switzerland, five had TSS, nine had possible TSS (fever and rash without shock), two had neonatal toxic shock syndrome&ndash;like exanthematous disease (NTED), one had scarlet fever, and the remaining had other infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Approximately 30 percent were community acquired. NTED has also been reported in neonates in Japan and France who are colonized with TSST-1&ndash;producing MRSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>Some data suggest that community-acquired MRSA strains may be more likely to cause TSS. In one study comparing toxin production among 85 strains (32 community-associated MRSA strains, 32 hospital-acquired MRSA strains, and 21 <em>S. aureus</em> isolates from patients with nonmenstrual toxic shock), most community-associated MRSA strains were highly related based on molecular typing and produced either enterotoxin B (15 percent) or enterotoxin C (81 percent) but not TSST-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The hospital-acquired strains were not related to the community-acquired strains and did not produce enterotoxin B, enterotoxin C, or TSST-1. Some correlation was observed between nonmenstrual and community-acquired strains (29 percent of nonmenstrual toxic shock strains were identical or highly related to the community-acquired strains; 16 produced either enterotoxin B or C, and none produced TSST-1).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxin production is an important pathogenic mechanism, as evidenced by clinical manifestations of shock, erythroderma, and multiorgan system involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) was the initial exotoxin isolated from <em>S. aureus</em> isolates implicated in toxic shock syndrome (TSS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. It is produced by 90 to 100 percent of <em>S. aureus</em> strains associated with menstrual cases of TSS and by 40 to 60 percent of strains associated with nonmenstrual cases. In studies examining the neurologic manifestations caused by TSST-1 during TSS, TSST-1 increased intracerebral prostaglandin E2 and caused caspase-dependent neuronal death in a neural cell line and in primary cortical neuron cultures in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The reasons that more strains causing menstrual TSS produce TSST-1 is not known. Hypotheses include structural differences that allow TSST-1 to transverse the vaginal mucosa or phenotypic differences in TSST-1 containing <em>S. aureus</em> strains that facilitate vaginal colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other toxins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The observation that nonmenstrual strains were less likely to produce TSST-1 led investigators to postulate the existence of other causative toxins. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B is produced by 38 to 62 percent of nonmenstrual TSST-1&ndash;negative strains, potentially implicating this toxin in TSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Several animal studies suggest that enterotoxin A may be a cofactor of TSST-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. A mutant strain deficient in enterotoxin A (but producing TSST-1) was significantly less lethal in a mouse model compared with a <em>S. aureus</em> strain that produced both toxins (70 versus 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, TSST-1 appeared to be the principal agent of menstrual TSS in a rabbit tampon model in which strains mutant in TSST-1 (but not enterotoxin A production) were less virulent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Other enterotoxins, specifically enterotoxins C, D, E, and H have been implicated in a smaller number of cases. In a study of 183 isolates of <em>S. aureus</em> from clinical specimens but not necessarily cases of TSS, 40 percent of the strains produced one or more toxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Fourteen percent of isolates produced TSST-1 and 20, 8, 6, and 3 percent, enterotoxins A, B, C, and D, respectively. Blood culture isolates were more likely to produce enterotoxin D.</p><p>Some investigators have postulated that other toxins may be more virulent than TSST-1; in one study of 32 <em>S. aureus</em> isolates from nonmenstrual TSS, 50 percent of individuals infected with a TSST-1&ndash;negative strain died, compared with 10 percent of TSST-1&ndash;positive strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Superantigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>S. aureus</em> exotoxins cause disease because they are superantigens, which are able to activate large numbers of T cells at one time, resulting in massive cytokine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In typical T cell recognition, an antigen is taken up by an antigen-presenting cell, processed, expressed on the cell surface in complex with class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in a groove formed by the alpha and beta chains of class II MHC, and recognized by an antigen-specific T cell receptor. In contrast, superantigens do not require processing by antigen-presenting cells but instead interact directly with the invariant region of the class II MHC molecule. Two regions of the TSST-1 toxin within the beta <span class=\"nowrap\">1/beta</span> 2 and beta <span class=\"nowrap\">3/beta</span> 4 loops have been found to be important for MHC class II binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The superantigen-MHC complex then interacts with the T cell receptor at the variable (V) part of the beta chain. Thus, all T cells with a recognized V beta region are stimulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) structure and function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Activated T cells then release interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and TNF-beta, and interferon (IFN)-gamma in large amounts, resulting in the signs and symptoms of TSS. IL-1 is an endogenous pyrogen and thus causes the high fevers associated with TSS. In addition, IL-1 mediates skeletal muscle proteolysis and probably accounts for the myalgia and elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) seen in TSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-treatment-of-fever-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and treatment of fever in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-infants-and-children-pathophysiology-and-management#H48346159\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever in infants and children: Pathophysiology and management&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The production of TNF inhibits both random and chemotactic migratory polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) functions. TSST-1&ndash;producing <em>S. aureus</em> do not engender a purulent response, which in part may be explained by PMN inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In addition, data suggest that TSST-1 and enterotoxin B repress the production of other <em>S. aureus</em> exoproteins, which may explain the absence of purulence in <em>S. aureus</em> infections associated with TSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. It has also been postulated that endogenous endotoxin, most likely from the gastrointestinal tract, enhances susceptibility to TSST-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Host antibody responses to the <em>S. aureus</em> exotoxins play an important role in the pathogenesis of TSS. Approximately 70 to 80 percent of individuals develop antibody to TSST-1 by the late teenage years, and by the fourth decade 90 to 95 percent have such antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. One study found that 76 percent of infants from birth to six months of age had positive antibody titers to TSST-1, compared with only 30 to 33 percent of infants between the ages of seven months and two years. Thus, the age of six months to two years corresponds with a period of vulnerability as passive immunity is waning and acquired antibodies have not been obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Patients with clinical TSS lack antibody to TSST-1 and often fail to develop appropriate antibodies in convalescent serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In a prospective study of burn patients who developed nosocomial MRSA infection, TSST-1 antibody level was significantly lower in the patients who developed TSS than those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In addition, decreased titers to the other staphylococcal enterotoxins in patients with TSS have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Individuals with TSS may fail to have an appropriate antibody response because superantigen-mediated production of IFN-gamma inhibits polyclonal immunoglobulin production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. This failure to develop antibodies may explain why some patients are predisposed to relapse after a first episode of TSS.</p><p>It is likely that varying factors are responsible for how superantigen-mediated disease affects different hosts. Genetically determined tendencies to produce different amounts of cytokines as well as titer of circulating antitoxin antibodies and the particular V beta segment that is recognized all probably play a role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have established clinical criteria for toxic shock syndrome (TSS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54778\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54778 \">table 1</a>). These criteria were established for epidemiologic surveillance and should be not be used to exclude a case that is highly suspicious for TSS, even if all criteria are not met.</p><p>Clinical manifestations of toxic shock syndrome include fever, hypotension, and skin manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Additional symptoms and signs include chills, malaise, headache, sore throat, myalgias, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and orthostatic dizziness or syncope.</p><p>The symptoms and signs of TSS develop rapidly, usually in otherwise healthy individuals. The median interval between the onset of menstruation and TSS in menstrual cases is two to three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>], and the onset of symptoms in postsurgical cases is two days, although the onset has been reported as late as 65 days postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/20,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29</a>].</p><p>During the initial 48 hours of hospitalization, patients may develop diffuse erythroderma, severe watery diarrhea, decreased urine output, cyanosis, and edema of the extremities. Neurologic symptoms such as somnolence, confusion, irritability, agitation, and hallucinations may occur secondary to cerebral ischemia and edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rapid onset of hypotension, defined as either a systolic blood pressure of &le;90 mmHg for adults or less than fifth percentile by age for children &lt;16 years of age, or an orthostatic decline in diastolic blood pressure of &ge;15 mmHg, or orthostatic syncope or dizziness, often leads to subsequent tissue ischemia and organ failure. Hypotension is caused by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance as well as nonhydrostatic leakage of fluid from the intravascular space to the interstitial space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], both of which occur as a consequence of the massive cytokine release induced by the responsible toxins. The hypotension can be unresponsive to large amounts of intravenous fluids and can persist for several days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of skin manifestations are seen in TSS. The initial erythroderma involves both the skin and the mucous membranes and is characterized by a diffuse, red, macular rash resembling sunburn that also involves the palms and soles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77600\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77600 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F82561\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82561 \">picture 2</a>). This rash can be subtle and fleeting. In postoperative TSS, the erythema may be more intense around the involved surgical wound site. Mucosal involvement includes conjunctival-scleral hemorrhage and hyperemia of the vaginal and oropharyngeal mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66457\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66457 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In more severe cases, superficial ulcerations occur on the mucous membranes, and petechiae, vesicles, and bullae develop. Patients also have nonpitting edema due to increases in interstitial fluid.</p><p>Late-onset skin manifestations include a pruritic maculopapular rash that may occur one to two weeks after the disease onset and desquamation of the palms and soles that characteristically begins one to three weeks after illness develops (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59735\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59735 \">picture 4</a>). Since desquamation occurs late, this is not to be used for acute diagnosis of TSS. In some cases, TSS may not be considered in the differential diagnosis until later when desquamation is observed; this is particularly true in nonmenstrual disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Some patients also experience loss of hair and nails one to two months following onset of illness, with regrowth by six months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiorgan system involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TSS can involve all organ systems. Many patients report diffuse myalgias and weakness as presenting symptoms, which are usually accompanied by an increase in serum concentrations of creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Gastrointestinal symptoms are also common, particularly profuse diarrhea.

To meet the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition for a confirmed case, patients must have fever &gt;38.9&deg;C, hypotension, diffuse erythroderma, desquamation (unless the patient dies before desquamation can occur), and involvement of at least three organ systems. A patient who is missing one of the characteristics of the confirmed case definition may be considered a probable case. However, the CDC criteria were established for epidemiologic surveillance and should be not be used to exclude a case that is highly suspicious for TSS, even if all criteria are not met.</p><p>The isolation of <em>S. aureus</em> is <strong>not</strong> required for the diagnosis of staphylococcal TSS. <em>S. aureus</em> is recovered from wound or mucosal sites in 80 to 90 percent of patients with TSS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] and recovered from blood cultures in approximately 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staphylococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In addition, acute and convalescent serum can be analyzed for antibody responses to various <em>S. aureus</em> exotoxins. The presence of a strain of <em>S. aureus</em> that produces toxin in a patient who does not have acute-phase antibody to the toxin is highly suggestive of TSS.

Other diagnostic considerations include streptococcal TSS, which is most often associated with severe pain and tenderness signifying infection at a site of local trauma, in addition to the other manifestations of TSS. It is important to distinguish between these two entities because patients with streptococcal TSS may require immediate surgical debridement of the involved site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-streptococcal-toxic-shock-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other diagnostic possibilities include Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), although the rash associated with RMSF typically is petechial, involves the extremities first, and occurs an average of three days after the development of fever.
