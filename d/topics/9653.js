Episodes last a few days to several weeks and are separated by weeks or months of normal sleep and behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. KLS is categorized as a central disorder of hypersomnolence; other disorders in this category include narcolepsy type 1 and type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-sleep-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of sleep disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The disease predominantly, but not exclusively, affects adolescent males, and most cases are sporadic. The cause of the disease is unknown, and the diagnosis is based on a unique constellation of clinical symptoms. In most cases, attacks cease spontaneously several years after onset. Treatment is primarily symptomatic, but stimulants and mood stabilizers (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>) can be considered in severe cases.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of KLS will be reviewed here. A general approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness and other central disorders of hypersomnolence are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of narcolepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-hypersomnia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic hypersomnia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11387268\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare disorder with an estimated prevalence of one to five cases per million population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. Population-based studies have not been performed. Patients with primary KLS can be found worldwide, with a higher prevalence among Ashkenazi Jews. (See <a href=\"#H958155\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> below.)</p><p>KLS is more common in males. In several large observational series, the proportion of males ranges from 60 to 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H958107\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is unknown. Although a psychological basis was considered most likely when the disorder was first described, contemporary hypotheses have focused primarily on genetic and immune-mediated causes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H958155\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A genetic basis for the disorder has been suggested by the preponderance of cases in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, suggesting a founder effect, as well as numerous reports of familial cases. To date, however, no specific genes have been identified.</p><p>Although the large majority of KLS cases are sporadic, familial cases account for approximately 5 percent of patients with primary KLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/3,5,8-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,8-18</a>]. In one of the larger families described, a father, three sons, and two daughters were affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Two pairs of monozygotic twins who were concordant for the syndrome have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The estimated risk of KLS in a first-degree relative of a patient with KLS is 1 percent. While this is a relatively low risk, it is 800 to 4000 times higher than the general population using an estimated KLS prevalence of 2 to 10 per million and five first-degree relatives per proband. The risk of psychiatric disorders (eg, bipolar disorder and depression) in first-degree relatives of patients with KLS is similar to that of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H960350\"><span class=\"h2\">Precipitating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of potential precipitating factors have been reported in patients with KLS. There appears to be seasonal variation in incidence, with first episodes occurring most commonly in autumn or winter. In one large series, 89 percent of patients remembered one or more events closely associated with disease onset, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections (72 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol ingestion (23 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep deprivation (22 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unusual stress (20 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical exertion (19 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traveling (10 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head trauma (9 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marijuana use (6 percent)</p><p/><p>Other series have also reported trivial infection, alcohol consumption, and head trauma as common precipitating factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4,6,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,19-22</a>]. In a cohort of 30 patients with KLS in Taiwan, both KLS onset and recurrent attacks correlated with epidemic upper respiratory tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. No specific infectious agents have been consistently identified. (See <a href=\"#H958237\" class=\"local\">'Infectious and immune-mediated theories'</a> below.)</p><p>KLS onset has also been reported after vaccinations, including typhoid and tetanus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], human papilloma virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and H1N1 influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H958237\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious and immune-mediated theories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An infectious or immune-mediated etiology has been hypothesized based on frequent reports of infectious-like symptoms at disease onset.</p><p>Focal viral encephalitis or postinfectious autoimmune encephalitis affecting specific areas of the brain (ie, thalamus-hypothalamus, frontal and temporal lobes) would be consistent with the nature of the disease. These structures have a pivotal role in the regulation of sleep, perception, mood, and impulse control, and KLS-like symptoms can occur in association with hypothalamic, frontal, and temporal lobe tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, evidence for such pathology in the brains of KLS patients remains elusive. (See <a href=\"#H959942\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathologic findings'</a> below and <a href=\"#H956999\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> below.)</p><p>In most cases of apparently infection-triggered KLS, symptoms of KLS occur between three and five days after the onset of fever. Agents responsible for the infection are rarely identified and highly variable, however, and the interval to episode onset is too short for most immune-mediated processes. Specific infections reported in association with KLS include Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster, herpes zoster, influenza A and B, adenovirus, enterovirus, H1N1, <em>Salmonella typhi</em>, and <em>Streptococcus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4,5,7,18,23,26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,18,23,26-30</a>]. The heterogeneity of identified agents and lack of measurable viral titers in most patients suggest no direct effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In support of autoimmunity as a possible etiology, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) subtype DQB1*02 has been associated with the disease in 30 European patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], a finding not replicated in larger populations when controlling for the exact haplotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H968132\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide variety of genetic disorders have been reported with increased frequency in patients with KLS, including Klinefelter syndrome, von Willebrand syndrome, polycystic kidneys, and autism (both high and low functioning) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F98009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98009 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/5,6,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,31,32</a>]. An abnormal birth or problematic early developmental history has also been described with increased prevalence. In a cohort of 108 patients with KLS, 34 percent reported either a complicated birth history (25 percent) or some degree of developmental delay (15 percent), compared with only 7 percent of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In two cases of primary KLS, the following findings were described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe inflammation of the thalamus and mild inflammation of the hypothalamus were described in a 46-year-old man who died from aspiration pneumonia during an attack of megaphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 17-year-old male with a classic form of KLS and autonomic dysfunction during attacks died from cardiopulmonary arrest during an attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The neuropathologic examination revealed mild depigmentation of the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. The cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus were normal.</p><p/><p>In two other reported cases, symptoms of KLS appeared to be secondary to a paraneoplastic syndrome, with abnormalities in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and gray matter of the temporal lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], or inflammatory encephalitis within the thalamus and hypothalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11387275\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia, behavioral and cognitive disturbances, compulsive eating, and hypersexuality. The disorder often begins in late adolescence and is more common in males than females. Physical examination, laboratories, and neuroimaging are typically normal. Polysomnography performed during an episode may confirm a long total sleep time, but the findings are otherwise nonspecific.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H969660\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The median age of onset of KLS is 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Approximately 80 percent of patients present during the second decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>], with a range of 4 to 82 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Patients with late onset (&gt;35 years) usually have typical symptoms but tend to have longer episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/23,33,38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,33,38-42</a>], while childhood onset (&lt;12 years) is associated with more frequent episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4,5,43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,43-46</a>]. In one large series, girls were older at onset than boys (18.5 versus 15.0 years), despite an earlier onset of puberty (11.8 versus 13.2 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Symptom severity during each episode tends to progress rapidly, within hours to days, and symptoms last for a median of 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4,5,8,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8,47</a>]. There is a broad range, however, and episodes can last for a few days in mild cases to several weeks or even months in more severe cases. Milder cases of KLS have one to three short episodes per year, but moderate cases can have monthly episodes of 7 to 10 days each [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4,5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,26</a>]. In a large series of 120 French patients with KLS, approximately 25 percent of patients experienced prolonged episodes of more than four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In severe cases, patients can experience 40 to 80 episodes in a rapid succession, with a possible permanent impairment of attention and mood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955439\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardinal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodic hypersomnia is a defining feature of KLS. Additional symptoms present in most patients during episodes of hypersomnia include cognitive disturbance, an altered perceptive state, referred to as derealization, and severe apathy. Although hyperphagia and hypersexuality have traditionally been considered hallmark clinical features, these symptoms are more variable across patients and episodes than previously thought and are better viewed as expressions of general disinhibition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11387281\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypersomnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypersomnia is a major clinical symptom of KLS and is mandatory for the diagnosis. Hypersomnia refers to an increase in actual sleep time and is distinct from symptoms of fatigue or low energy. Sleep is enormously increased during episodes, with a median total sleep time of 18 hours per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], sometimes with loss of the normal circadian rhythm of sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Most patients are difficult to awaken and report intense dreaming and hypnagogic hallucinations; sleep paralysis is uncommon. The need for sleep is so intense that patients may be found sleeping in the hallway outside a classroom or on the sidewalk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. Patients remain arousable, waking up spontaneously to void and eat, but are usually irritable or aggressive when awakened or prevented from sleeping.</p><p>There is frequently a brief overshoot of insomnia at the end of an episode. This insomnia is sometimes associated with euphoria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/5,39,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,39,51,52</a>]. As an example, one patient described the feeling as follows: &quot;All I want to do is stay awake and get things done that I was unable to while in the episode. Plus, it is as if I have been reenergized.&quot; The need for sleep and total sleep time tend to diminish during later episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11387293\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive disturbance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive disturbance is the second most common symptom after hypersomnia. The large majority of patients have difficulty reading and speaking during episodes. Abnormal, effortful speech has been described in more than two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Symptoms include mutism, absence of spontaneous speech, monosyllabic or short sentences, limited vocabulary, and slurred, muddled, incoherent, or childish stereotypical language. Patients may also have slowness of speech and comprehension, verbal perseveration, and echolalia.</p><p>Memory disturbances are common, and the majority of patients report incomplete recollection of episodes. One patient described this symptom as follows: &quot;It seems like a movie that is cut up, so scenes are missing.&quot; Eye-hand coordination and simple gestures, such as finding one's key in a pocket, may be difficult and perceived abnormally (astereognosia). Clumsiness resulting in broken limbs has been described. Temporal disorientation is twice as frequent as spatial disorientation. Altered perception is always present and can affect all senses: &quot;Things seemed hazy, foggy&quot;; &quot;I would break a cup to see if it would break to reassure me things were normal.&quot;</p><p>Formal cognitive and memory tests have been rarely performed during a KLS episode, and their validity is questionable as patients can be uncooperative, irritable, sleepy, and inattentive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>].</p><p>In between episodes, the vast majority of patients are described as completely normal. However, academic decline and mild, long-lasting memory dysfunction have been reported between episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/44,53,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,53,56,57</a>] or even after resolution of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/23,53,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,53,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956272\"><span class=\"h3\">Derealization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During episodes, sensations of unreality are common and are probably the most specific symptom of the syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Surroundings are seemingly wrong, distorted, or unreal. Perception of sight, sound, smell, taste, temperature, and pain can all feel abnormal or unreal.

(See <a href=\"#H11387293\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive disturbance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11387443\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the midst of an episode, particularly if it is the first, numerous neurologic disorders may be considered on the differential diagnosis.</p><p>One or more of the cardinal symptoms of KLS could be caused by structural pathology in the hypothalamus, frontal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> temporal lobes, such as tumors (eg, craniopharyngioma, glioma, pinealoma, meningioma, colloid cyst), stroke, or <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammation/demyelination</span> (eg, infectious, autoimmune, or paraneoplastic encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, multiple sclerosis). In contrast with KLS, however, neurologic symptoms caused by all of these processes are not typically episodic, and patients often have additional findings on neurologic exam. Cystic tumors or colloid cysts within the third ventricle, which may cause episodic symptoms due to a ball-valve mechanisms of obstruction, can be distinguished from KLS due to additional symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (headache, nausea, vomiting).</p><p>The episodic nature of the symptoms in KLS may raise the possibility of epilepsy, particularly temporal lobe epilepsy or nonconvulsive status epilepticus. However, cardinal features of KLS, including prolonged periods (days) of derealization, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and hypersexuality, are not typical for epilepsy. An electroencephalogram (EEG) performed during an episode can often distinguish between KLS and epilepsy if the two cannot be distinguished clinically.</p><p>Patients with Lewy Body dementia may have fluctuations of alertness associated with behavioral disturbances, but they are older than KLS patients, have permanent cognitive deficits, and often have associated Parkinsonism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11387449\"><span class=\"h2\">Other sleep disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive daytime sleepiness is also a major symptom of obstructive sleep apnea, delayed sleep phase syndrome, narcolepsy, and idiopathic hypersomnia. However, the clinical picture in all of these entities is neither episodic nor characterized by such severe cognitive or behavioral problems. Sleep time may mildly fluctuate in patients with these syndromes, however; hence, polysomnography is generally indicated in those with residual sleepiness during asymptomatic periods to exclude an alternative sleep disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness#H1822286\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H294887\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic encephalopathy or intoxication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less common causes of recurrent hypersomnia are benzodiazepine intoxication, drug and alcohol overdoses or abuse, and recurrent metabolic encephalopathies due to hyperammonemia, aminoaciduria, or organic acidemia. A metabolic encephalopathy should be suspected in young children with developmental regression, failure to thrive, recurrent vomiting, and a positive family history of developmental delay or parental consanguinity. Other signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and acidosis (eg, papilledema, pyramidal signs, Kussmaul breathing) are also expected in metabolic encephalopathies and should not be present in patients with KLS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11387455\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodes of Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) tend to decrease in frequency and intensity over time, especially prior to disease termination.</p><p>Disease duration from the first to the last episode is extremely variable, with a spectrum ranging from 6 months to 41 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kleine-levin-syndrome-recurrent-hypersomnia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

KLS is categorized as a central disorder of hypersomnolence; other disorders in this category include narcolepsy type 1 and type 2 and idiopathic hypersomnia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-sleep-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of sleep disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology of KLS is unknown. Although a psychological basis was considered most likely when the disorder was first described, contemporary hypotheses have focused primarily on genetic and immune-mediated causes. (See <a href=\"#H958107\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median age of onset of KLS is 16 years, and approximately 80 percent of patients present within the second decade of life. KLS primarily affects adolescent males and has an unpredictable course of recurrence and remission lasting for years. Symptom severity during each episode tends to progress rapidly, within hours to days, and symptoms last for a median of 10 days. (See <a href=\"#H969660\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11387455\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodic hypersomnia is a defining feature of KLS. Additional symptoms present in the most patients during episodes of hypersomnia include cognitive disturbances and an altered perceptive state, referred to as derealization. Although hyperphagia and hypersexuality have traditionally been considered hallmark clinical features, these symptoms are more variable across patients and episodes than previously thought and are better viewed as expressions of general disinhibition. (See <a href=\"#H955439\" class=\"local\">'Cardinal symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional symptoms that may be reported during episodes include mood disturbances, apathy, visual and auditory hallucinations, and compulsive behaviors aside from hyperphagia and hypersexuality. (See <a href=\"#H955481\" class=\"local\">'Other symptoms during KLS episodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In between episodes, most patients with KLS return to a normal baseline and are generally indistinguishable from controls on measures of sleep, cognition, and mood. (See <a href=\"#H619136724\" class=\"local\">'Features in between episodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural brain imaging is normal in patients with KLS. The most consistent findings on functional imaging studies are reduced perfusion or metabolism in the temporal lobes, diencephalon, parietotemporal junction, and association cortex. (See <a href=\"#H956999\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>KLS is a rare disorder that should be suspected in adolescents, particularly males, who present with episodic hypersomnia, cognitive disturbance, and behavioral changes with a return to baseline between attacks. Physical examination, laboratories, and neuroimaging are typically normal. Polysomnography performed during an episode may confirm a long total sleep time, but the findings are otherwise nonspecific. Because of the rarity of the syndrome and the nonspecific nature of some of the symptoms, all patients with suspected KLS should undergo intensive investigation for other potential etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H11387425\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H619136791\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of KLS includes a variety of psychiatric, neurologic, and sleep disorders, most of which are much more common than KLS. Most can be distinguished by clinical features, neuroimaging, electroencephalogram (EEG), polysomnography, and lumbar puncture in selected cases. (See <a href=\"#H961052\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology of KLS is unknown, and, therefore, treatment is primarily supportive and educational. Nonpharmacologic management, which includes establishing a safe sleeping environment, educating caregivers and teachers, and monitoring for medical and psychiatric complications, is the mainstay of therapy for all patients. (See <a href=\"#H966087\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom-based pharmacotherapy may be warranted in severely affected patients, but results are often disappointing.
