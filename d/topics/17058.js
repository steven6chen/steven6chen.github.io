This entity is the result of technological advances in imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and their widespread use in clinical practice. Discovery of an adrenal mass raises two questions that determine the degree of evaluation and the need for therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it malignant?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it functioning?</p><p/><p>The approach to the evaluation and management of adrenal incidentalomas is reviewed here. Detailed discussions of adrenal carcinoma and functioning adrenal tumors such as pheochromocytomas and aldosteronomas are found elsewhere.

In a study of 61,054 abdominal CT scans performed from 1985 to 1990, an incidental adrenal tumor (incidentaloma &gt;1 cm) was detected in 259 patients (0.4 percent of all CT scans) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A subsequent study, utilizing higher resolution scanners, reported a prevalence of adrenal incidentaloma on abdominal CT of 4.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The prevalence of adrenal incidentaloma is higher in older patients (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In autopsy studies, the prevalence of incidentalomas is 2 percent, and it ranges from 1 to 9 percent. The prevalence is higher in obese, diabetic, and hypertensive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, in a series of 739 autopsies, adrenal masses between 2 mm and 4 cm in size were present in 9 percent of normotensive patients and in 12 percent of patients who had hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Bilateral masses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analyses from two large adrenal incidentaloma studies with 887 and 202 patients showed that bilateral masses were found in 10 to 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Bilateral adrenal masses can be seen with metastatic disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cortical adenomas, lymphoma, infection (eg, tuberculosis, fungal), hemorrhage, corticotropin (ACTH)-dependent Cushing's, pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism, amyloidosis, infiltrative disease of the adrenal glands, and bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (BMAH). In one study of 208 adrenal incidentaloma patients, 19 (9 percent) proved to have adrenal metastases; 10 of the 19 patients (53 percent) had bilateral disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In some patients with bilateral disease, one adrenal mass proves to be a nonfunctioning cortical adenoma while the contralateral adrenal mass is hormone-secreting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, adrenocortical hypofunction may occur in patients with bilateral adrenal masses. Therefore, all patients with bilateral adrenal masses should be screened for adrenocortical hyper- and hypo-function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR MALIGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignancy is an uncommon cause of adrenal incidentaloma in patients without a known diagnosis of cancer. Although estimates have varied widely, the actual frequency of primary adrenal carcinoma in patients with adrenal incidentaloma is approximately 2 to 5 percent; another 0.7 to 2.5 percent have nonadrenal metastases to the adrenal gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/1,5,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,10-12</a>]. The size and imaging characteristics (&quot;imaging phenotype&quot;) of the mass may help determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/1,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maximum diameter of the adrenal mass is predictive of malignancy. This was illustrated in a study of 887 patients with adrenal incidentalomas from the National Italian Study Group on Adrenal Tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Adrenocortical carcinomas were significantly associated with mass size, with 90 percent being more than 4 cm in diameter when discovered.</p><p>Adrenal mass size is also important because the smaller the adrenocortical carcinoma is at the time of diagnosis, the better the overall prognosis. In a retrospective review of 62 patients with adrenocortical carcinoma, five-year survival was approximately 16 percent overall, but much higher (42 percent) in patients with smaller tumors (stages I and II, confined to the adrenal gland) who were more likely to undergo curative resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-evaluation-of-adrenocortical-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and evaluation of adrenocortical tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenocortical-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the report from the National Italian Study Group, a 4 cm cutoff had a 93 percent sensitivity of detecting adrenocortical carcinoma, even though specificity was limited (76 percent of masses larger than 4 cm in diameter were benign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. In the Mayo Clinic study cited above, all 20 adrenal carcinomas were between 4 and 6 cm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Therefore, surgical removal of unilateral adrenal masses larger than 4 cm should be considered to avoid missing adrenal carcinomas, particularly in younger patients.</p><p>However, adrenal mass size should not be used as the only parameter to guide treatment. In particular, radiographic characteristics (imaging phenotype) and change in size over time also have strong predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Imaging phenotype'</a> below and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging phenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with 2 to 3 mm cuts may allow prediction of the histologic type of the adrenal tumor, which is particularly important in the evaluation of masses that do not meet the size criterion for removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. As an example, the lipid-rich nature of a cortical adenoma is helpful in distinguishing this benign tumor from carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">CT scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On CT scanning, the density of the image (black is less dense) is attributed to radiograph attenuation. The intracytoplasmic fat in adenomas results in low attenuation on nonenhanced CT; nonadenomas have higher attenuation in nonenhanced CT. The Hounsfield scale is a semiquantitative method of measuring radiograph attenuation. Typical precontrast Hounsfield unit (HU) values are adipose tissue = -20 to -150 HU and kidney = 20 to 150 HU. If an adrenal mass measures &lt;10 HU on unenhanced CT (ie, has the density of fat), the likelihood that it is a benign adenoma is nearly 100 percent. However, up to 30 percent of adenomas do not contain large amounts of lipid and may be indistinguishable from nonadenomas on nonenhanced CT scans.</p><p>A consensus panel noted that a homogeneous adrenal mass with a smooth border and an attenuation value &lt;10 HU on unenhanced CT is very likely to be a benign adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This appears to be a reasonable CT HU cutoff based upon a retrospective analysis of 151 patients with adrenal masses who underwent both a noncontrast CT scan and adrenalectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The mean HU (&plusmn; standard deviation [SD]) for adrenal <span class=\"nowrap\">adenomas/hyperplasia</span> was significantly lower than for adrenal carcinomas, metastases, and pheochromocytomas (16.2&plusmn;13.6 versus 36.9&plusmn;4.1, 39.2&plusmn;15.2, and 38.6&plusmn;8.2, respectively). The only patients in the nonadenoma groups with a noncontrast CT HU &lt;10 were those with myelolipomas (which were all less than -40 and therefore easily distinguishable). In this series, a noncontrast CT HU &le;10 or a combination of tumor size &le;4 cm and HU &le;20 excluded nonadenomas in 100 percent of cases.</p><p>On delayed contrast-enhanced CT, adenomas typically exhibit rapid contrast medium washout, whereas nonadenomas have delayed contrast material washout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Ten minutes after administration of contrast, an absolute contrast medium washout of more than 50 percent was reported to be 100 percent sensitive and specific for adenoma when patients with adenomas were compared with carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, and metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Although imaging phenotype does not predict hormonal function, it does predict underlying pathology, and surgical resection should be considered in patients with adrenal incidentalomas that have a suspicious imaging phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although CT is the recommended primary adrenal imaging procedure in most cases, MRI has advantages in certain clinical situations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional spin-echo MRI is the most frequently used technique.

class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72437 \">image 5</a>) are usually easily characterized because of their distinctive imaging characteristics.</p><p>Despite these radiographic characteristics, currently available imaging studies can be misleading. One study, as an example, evaluated 25 patients with potentially operable non-small cell lung cancer and a unilateral adrenal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thin-section MRI correctly predicted a malignant tumor in all four patients with histologically proven metastases, but 14 of 21 histologically benign masses were read as malignant and two as indeterminate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Fine-needle aspiration biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytology from a specimen obtained by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy <strong>cannot</strong> distinguish a benign adrenal mass from the less common adrenal carcinoma. It can, however, distinguish between an adrenal tumor and a metastatic tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In a patient with a known primary malignancy elsewhere who has a newly discovered adrenal mass that has an imaging phenotype consistent with metastatic disease, performing a diagnostic CT-guided FNA biopsy may be indicated, but only after excluding pheochromocytoma with biochemical testing. Adrenal biopsy would not be needed if the patient was already known to have widespread metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>One report, as an example, evaluated patients with known lung cancer and an adrenal mass; FNA biopsy revealed a benign adrenal lesion in two-thirds of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. When the non-adrenal cancer is occult, most adrenal masses are incidentaloma cortical adenomas (91 of 95 in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]). Thus, FNA biopsy is not useful in the routine evaluation of incidentalomas in patients suspected to have small non-adrenal cancers.</p><p>Image-guided FNA biopsy is relatively safe; the complication rate was 2.8 percent in one series of 277 biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The risks of this procedure include adrenal and liver hematoma, abdominal pain, hematuria, pancreatitis, pneumothorax, formation of an adrenal abscess, and tumor recurrence along the needle track [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The FNA biopsy of a pheochromocytoma may result in hemorrhage and hypertensive crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Therefore, the possibility of pheochromocytoma should always be ruled out by biochemical testing before FNA biopsy is undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR HORMONAL SECRETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While most adrenal incidentalomas are nonfunctional, 10 to 15 percent secrete excess amounts of hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The most complete analysis of this issue comes from a review of all 828 published articles on adrenal incidentalomas from 1980 to 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Only 20 of the 828 articles were selected as having met the strict criteria for a &quot;true&quot; adrenal incidentaloma; of these, only nine had adequate data on both diagnosis and follow-up. Patients who were suspected as having cancer were excluded. Among the 1800 patients in these nine series, these overall mean percentages of diagnoses were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant &ndash; Primary adrenal carcinoma 1.9 percent, metastases 0.7 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign &ndash; Nonfunctioning 89.7 percent, subclinical Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome 6.4 percent, pheochromocytoma 3.1 percent, primary aldosteronism 0.6 percent</p><p/><p>Appropriate case detection tests should be performed if the patient has clinical features that are suggestive of increased adrenal function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58753\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58753 \">table 1</a>). However, subclinical Cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytoma are sufficiently common that <strong>all</strong> patients with an adrenal incidentaloma should be tested for these disorders.

Some adrenal incidentalomas secrete cortisol independently of corticotropin (ACTH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adrenal-incidentaloma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], which may have clinically important consequences.

The clinical scenario and patient age frequently guide the management decisions in patients who have adrenal incidentalomas that fall on either side of the 4 cm diameter cutoff. As an example, most clinicians would advise resecting a uniform hypodense (9 Hounsfield unit [HU]) 3.7 cm adrenal incidentaloma in a 23-year-old woman, whereas most clinicians would choose serial imaging follow-up in an 83-year-old woman with a uniform hypodense (9 HU) 4.7 cm adrenal incidentaloma. Surgical resection should be considered in this example of a young woman because adrenal cortical nodularity is, in part, a function of aging and such a finding in a 23-year-old is not normal. In addition, the alternative would be long-term imaging follow-up, which is associated with clinically significant expense, worry, and risks. Before surgery, all patients should undergo appropriate testing for functional tumors.
