In addition, the disorder has unique effects on growth and development. The clinical features of hyperthyroidism are largely independent of the cause. While the terms hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are often used interchangeably, in this topic thyrotoxicosis refers to the clinical symptomatology resulting from excess thyroid hormone, either of endogenous or exogenous origin. Hyperthyroidism refers specifically to excessive synthesis and secretion of endogenous thyroid hormone. Although there are several potential causes of hyperthyroidism in children, Graves' disease is by far the most common etiology.</p><p>In addition to causing hyperthyroidism, Graves' disease causes unique problems that are not related to the high serum thyroid hormone concentrations. They include Graves' ophthalmopathy and infiltrative dermopathy (localized or pretibial myxedema). Graves' ophthalmopathy is common in children, but less severe than in adults; dermopathy is almost never found in children. Most patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism have a diffuse goiter, but so do patients with other, less common causes of hyperthyroidism, such as &quot;Hashitoxicosis&quot; (silent or painless thyroiditis), subacute thyroiditis, or forms of nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism. These disorders are discussed briefly in this topic review. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Destructive thyroiditis'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical presentation and laboratory evaluation of children with hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis are discussed here. Treatment of hyperthyroidism is discussed separately. Hyperthyroidism presenting during the neonatal period also is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-graves-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of Graves' disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of neonatal Graves' disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Graves' disease is by far the most common cause of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents. In a national population-based study of thyrotoxicosis from the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2004, the annual incidence was 0.9 per 100,000 children &lt;15 years of age, with Graves' disease accounting for 96 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A nationwide study from Denmark reported an incidence of 0.79 per 100,000 in children &lt;15 years of age in the time period of 1982 to 1988, with a doubling to 1.58 per 100,000 in the years 1998 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A report using data from the US National Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys (NHANES) analyzing adolescents and young adults found that thyrotoxicosis was more common in non-Hispanic blacks than Mexican-Americans, in whom it was more common than non-Hispanic whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Overall, the prevalence of Graves' hyperthyroidism in children is approximately 0.02 percent (1:5000), mostly in the 11- to 15-year age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a report of 143 children with Graves' disease, 38 percent were prepubertal at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Girls are affected more commonly than boys, at a ratio of about 5:1. The ratio is considerably lower among younger children, suggesting that estrogen secretion in some way affects the occurrence of Graves' disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proximate cause of Graves' hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents, as in adults, is thyrotropin (TSH) receptor-stimulating antibodies (TSHR-Ab), which activate the TSH receptor. A population-based study of Danish twins suggested that approximately 80 percent of the risk of Graves' disease is attributable to genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graves-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Graves' disease&quot;</a>). The development of Graves' disease has also been reported in children after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, so-called Graves' immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The mechanism is believed to be immunological dysregulation during T-cell engraftment with subsequent production of TSHR-Ab by B-cells. </p><p>Graves' ophthalmopathy may result from antibodies against a TSH receptor-like protein in retroorbital connective tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A study in children with Graves' disease reported a positive association between elevated levels of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) and the development of ophthalmopathy, further suggesting that the eye complications are a part of the autoimmune process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>). The same mechanism may be responsible for Graves' dermopathy, as normal dermal fibroblasts have been demonstrated to express TSH receptor protein. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretibial-myxedema-thyroid-dermopathy-in-autoimmune-thyroid-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretibial myxedema (thyroid dermopathy) in autoimmune thyroid disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Many children and adolescents with Graves' hyperthyroidism have a family history of autoimmune thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The patients themselves may have an increased frequency of other autoimmune endocrine diseases (eg, diabetes mellitus, celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and primary adrenal insufficiency) and nonendocrine autoimmune disorders (eg, vitiligo, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], thrombocytopenic purpura, and pernicious anemia). Conversely, a report from Germany and Austria found a prevalence of hyperthyroidism of 0.46 percent (1:217) in children with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some patients have antineutrophil antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Children with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) have an increased risk for Graves' hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a review from Spain, 12 of 1832 patients with Down syndrome were diagnosed with hyperthyroidism (6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/1000)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a separate series, Down syndrome patients tended to be diagnosed with hyperthyroidism at an earlier age as compared with children without Down syndrome, and they did not show the usual female preponderance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients with Turner syndrome may also be at increased risk for hyperthyroidism; in one series, 2 out of 119 developed Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the clinical features of hyperthyroidism in children and adolescents are similar to those in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>]. The onset of these manifestations is often insidious, and the changes may be present for months or years before the diagnosis is made. Hyperthyroidism has unique effects in children on growth and pubertal development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acceleration of growth is accompanied by advancement of epiphyseal maturation. The acceleration in growth is usually subtle and depends upon the duration of hyperthyroidism before diagnosis. As an example, in children who have had hyperthyroidism for one to two years, height may increase from the 50th to the 75th percentile. The effect on growth may be more pronounced if hyperthyroidism presents in early childhood. In a report of children aged 3.4 to 7.5 years, median height was +1.25 SD, while BMI was -0.48 standard deviations (SD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. With antithyroid drug treatment, height velocity and bone age approach a more normal pattern. In a report of 101 children with Graves' disease from Italy, bone age was advanced at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nonetheless, adult height was normal after treatment with antithyroid drugs, and was even slightly increased in the boys who were diagnosed during puberty.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Puberty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age of onset of puberty and attainment of pubertal stages does not appear to be altered by hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Girls who have undergone menarche may develop oligomenorrhea or secondary amenorrhea; anovulatory cycles are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Hyperthyroidism is associated with high levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which may result in high serum estradiol levels in girls and testosterone levels in boys. However, unbound or free levels of these hormones are decreased, perhaps explaining why LH levels are slightly elevated. Hyperthyroidism also is associated with increased aromatization of androgens to estrogens. These hormonal changes have been associated with gynecomastia in men; there have been no reports of gynecomastia in boys with Graves' hyperthyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Eyes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stare and lid lag occur in many children with hyperthyroidism. The symptoms are caused by sympathetic overactivity, possibly mediated by increased alpha-adrenergic receptors in some tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Lid lag is evaluated by having the patient follow the examiner's finger as it is moved up and down. The patient has lid lag if the sclera can be seen above the iris as the patient looks downward.</p><p>Ophthalmopathy is characterized by inflammation of the extraocular muscles and orbital fat and connective tissue, which results in proptosis (exophthalmos), impairment of eye muscle function, and periorbital edema. These findings are almost always caused by Graves' disease. Although 50 to 75 percent of children with Graves' disease have some features of Graves' ophthalmopathy, the symptoms tend to be milder than those seen in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In a series of 152 children with Graves' disease, only 17 percent required referral to an ophthalmologist for management of Graves' eye disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Another study showed a trend toward less severe eye findings in prepubertal as compared with postpubertal children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Ophthalmopathy is more common in patients who smoke cigarettes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with ophthalmopathy may have a gritty feeling or pain in their eyes, and they may have diplopia caused by extraocular muscle dysfunction. Corneal ulceration can occur as a result of proptosis and lid retraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In a child with hyperthyroidism, the presence of eye findings such as lid lag, ocular muscle dysfunction, or exophthalmos essentially always points to Graves' disease as the underlying etiology of these features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Goiter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with Graves' hyperthyroidism have a diffuse goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The surface tends to be smooth, fleshy in consistency, without palpable nodules. A large goiter may cause dysphagia and tracheal compression with complaints of dyspnea. A bruit can often be auscultated over the gland in hyperthyroid patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hyperthyroidism have an increase in cardiac output, caused by both increased peripheral oxygen needs and increased cardiac contractility.

Atrial fibrillation, which occurs in 10 to 20 percent of adults with hyperthyroidism, is rare in children. Mitral valve prolapse is two to three times more prevalent in hyperthyroid patients than in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum lipids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hyperthyroidism tend to have low serum total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations and a low total <span class=\"nowrap\">cholesterol/HDL</span> cholesterol ratio.

Weight loss is caused primarily by increased calorigenesis, and secondarily by increased gut motility and associated hyperdefecation and malabsorption. With treatment, children regain lost weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. With the childhood obesity epidemic, more recent studies show that children are not underweight at diagnosis; hyperphagia may persist after treatment restores euthyroidism, resulting in excessive weight gain in some children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is probably modestly increased among individuals with autoimmune thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (thyrotoxic periodic paralysis) is a rare disorder that may be associated with hyperthyroidism, especially in Asian adolescent boys. In addition, Graves' disease may be associated with myasthenia gravis and thymic enlargement.</p><p>Thyroid hormone stimulates bone resorption, resulting in increased porosity of cortical bone and reduced volume of trabecular bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin concentrations are high, indicative of increased bone turnover. The increase in bone resorption may lead to an increase in serum calcium concentrations, thereby inhibiting parathyroid hormone secretion and the conversion of calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) to calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). The net effect is osteoporosis and an increased fracture risk in patients with chronic hyperthyroidism.

Short attention span and poor school performance are often incorrectly ascribed to attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p><p>Graves' disease has been reported in association with moyamoya disease, a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by severe bilateral stenosis of the terminal portions of the carotid arteries with prominent collateral circulation and cerebral ischemic events or epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Although it is rare, moyamoya disease should be considered in patients with Graves' disease and focal neurological symptoms.

Sweating is increased because of increased calorigenesis. Onycholysis (loosening of the nails from the nail bed, Plummer's nails) and softening of the nails and thinning of the hair may occur. Vitiligo and alopecia areata can occur in association with autoimmune disorders. Dermopathy, the third component of the classic triad of Graves' disease, is rarely, if ever, reported in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many children and adolescents, the presence of hyperthyroidism is obvious from the history and physical examination, once it is considered. It should be confirmed by measurements of serum thyroid function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Serum thyrotropin (TSH) is suppressed, and free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are elevated for age. Rarely, some children will have typical physical features of Graves' disease, including a goiter and Graves' eye findings, but thyroid function tests will be normal, so-called &quot;euthyroid Graves' disease.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After thyroid function testing confirms that the patient is hyperthyroid, the next step in the diagnostic evaluation is to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism. The various etiologies can be distinguished by the clinical examination, serum antithyroid antibody measurement, and radioactive iodine uptake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58890 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in children is Graves' disease; other etiologies make up fewer than 10 percent of cases. Thus, the evaluation typically begins by measurement of thyrotropin receptor-stimulating antibody (TSHR-Ab) to confirm Graves' disease as the etiology. The most accurate TSHR-Ab test is a measurement of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI). TSI is a functional assay, measuring production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in cultured thyroid follicular cells, confirming the presence of a stimulating antibody. Studies report that TSI is detectable in 60 to 90 percent of children with Graves' hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. One study describing a new technique, which employs a novel chimeric TSHR bioassay and a cAMP response element-dependent luciferase, reported that a TSHR-stimulating Ab was present in 94 percent of children with Graves' disease, including 100 percent of untreated children at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>An alternative TSHR-Ab test is thyrotropin binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII). This test, employing competitive protein binding methodology, shows that there is an antibody that competes with TSH binding to its receptor, but it does not provide information about whether it is a stimulating or blocking antibody. One study of 57 children with Graves' disease actually reported that TBII was positive in all patients measured (n = 18), while TSI was positive in only 57 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Thus, TBII may be helpful in establishing a diagnosis of Graves' disease in patients with typical symptoms and signs but in whom TSI is negative.</p><p>An elevated TSI confirms the diagnosis of Graves' disease. If the TSI level is not elevated, the next step is to perform radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake. 123-I is the radionucleotide of choice for thyroid uptake and scans, as it has a shorter half-life (13.2 hours) and delivers a much smaller radiation dose to the thyroid gland as compared with 131-I. The RAI uptake (typically assessed at 6 and 24 hours after isotope administration) is elevated in Graves' disease, and the accompanying scan typically will show diffuse uptake throughout the gland, confirming the diagnosis of Graves' hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The RAI uptake and scan also will help to delineate etiologies other than Graves' disease.</p><p>Of note, pharmacologic doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biotin-vitamin-h-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">biotin</a> (such as those used for certain inherited metabolic diseases) may cause artifactual abnormalities in laboratory tests of TSH, T4, and TSHR-Ab. These vary with the assay used, but subnormal serum TSH levels have been reported, thus mimicking hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].

Most cases of thyrotoxicosis are associated with hyperthyroidism, particularly in children. However, in a few children with autoimmune thyroiditis, inflammatory changes result in autonomous release of preformed, stored thyroid hormones, causing hyperthyroidism. The causes of hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis in children are described below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58890 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Graves' disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in children is Graves' disease. In children with hyperthyroidism, the presence of ophthalmopathy strongly suggests the diagnosis of Graves' disease. Even in children with hyperthyroidism who have a goiter but who lack ophthalmopathy, Graves' disease is still the most likely cause.</p><p>Thyrotropin receptor-stimulating antibodies (TSHR-Ab) are detectable in 60 to 94 percent of children with Graves' hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. When antibodies are not detected, the diagnosis can be supported by a 24-hour radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake and scan that shows diffuse increased uptake. Alternatively, measurement of thyrotropin binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII) may allow a serologic diagnosis of Graves' disease. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p>A minority of children with hyperthyroidism who are initially diagnosed and treated for Graves' disease ultimately prove to have chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], in which case the diagnosis often becomes clear during the clinical course. (See <a href=\"#H4740582\" class=\"local\">'Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis with thyrotoxic phase: &quot;Hashitoxicosis&quot;'</a> below.) </p><p>The treatment of Graves' disease is discussed separately.

However, approximately 5 to 10 percent of children present with a hyperthyroid (thyrotoxic) phase, sometimes termed &quot;Hashitoxicosis.&quot; Hyperthyroidism in this entity is usually caused by inflammation and autonomous release of preformed, stored thyroid hormone. Clinically, it is different from Graves' hyperthyroidism in that the thyrotoxicosis typically has a shorter course, lasting a few months rather than years, and Graves' ophthalmopathy is absent. Antithyroglobulin antibodies (Tg-Ab) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-Ab) are commonly positive (similar to Graves' disease). In contrast with Graves' disease, TSHR-Ab is typically negative in patients with Hashitoxicosis, if the thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) test is used, whereas TBII may be positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58890 \">table 1</a>). RAI uptake also helps to distinguish between Graves' disease and Hashitoxicosis: RAI is high (and diffuse) in Graves' disease, and low or absent in most cases of Hashitoxicosis, and a scan will show an inhomogeneous picture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. As there is no overproduction of thyroid hormone, antithyroid drug treatment is not effective; patients can be treated with beta-adrenergic antagonists until the thyrotoxicosis resolves.</p><p>Despite these typical differences, it is sometimes impossible to distinguish between Graves' disease and Hashitoxicosis initially, since some children with Hashitoxicosis are reported to have positive TSI and elevated 24-hour 123-I uptake at presentation. During the hyperthyroid phase, clinical clues that suggest Hashitoxicosis rather than Graves' disease include relatively rapid resolution of their hyperthyroidism during treatment with antithyroid drugs, typically within six months of diagnosis. Indeed, whether Hashitoxicosis is a distinct entity remains controversial because its clinical features and mechanisms overlap with both Graves' disease and with chronic lymphocytic (painless) thyroiditis. Furthermore, some children with Graves' disease have a preceding history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In one series, 4 of 109 children with Graves' hyperthyroidism previously had been diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (with associated hypothyroidism or euthyroidism) from 1.5 to 2.8 years prior to the diagnosis of Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p>Some patients with Hashitoxicosis appear to produce both thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSHR-Ab, as do patients with Graves' disease), and thyroid-blocking antibodies (TRB-Ab). In this case, the clinical course depends on which antibody predominates, and the patients tend to undergo cycles of hyper- and hypothyroidism. As an example, one report described 69 children with autoimmune thyroiditis, eight of whom were considered to have Hashitoxicosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. As is typical in Hashitoxicosis, the duration of hyperthyroidism was shorter than in Graves' disease, ranging from 31 to 168 days. However, a minority of these patients had elevated radioiodine uptake or mildly increased TSI levels, consistent with a form of hyperthyroidism that is mediated by thyroid-stimulating antibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4740591\"><span class=\"h3\">Subacute granulomatous thyroiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subacute thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain's disease or painful thyroiditis, is rare in childhood. It is characterized by painful swelling of the thyroid gland, and most likely it is caused by a viral infection. The inflammation results in autonomous release of preformed, stored thyroid hormone, resulting initially in a thyrotoxic phase, followed by euthyroidism, then hypothyroidism, and usually returning to euthyroidism. Thyroid antibodies are negative; RAI uptake is low or absent during the thyrotoxic phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

They are suspected in the setting of hyperthyroidism and palpation of a nodule on neck examination. Most such &quot;hot nodules&quot; are autonomously functioning toxic adenomas; many of these have been shown to be the result of TSH receptor-activating mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Thyroid adenomas typically produce T3, so serum testing may show an elevated T3 and suppressed TSH, with a normal or elevated FT4. Thyroid antibodies, including TSI, are negative. RAI uptake and scan will show uptake only in the functioning nodule, with the rest of the gland suppressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

They are suspected in the setting of hyperthyroidism and palpation of a goiter with multiple nodules.

Antithyroid antibodies, including TSI, are negative. Generally, an RAI uptake and scan is indicated to separate this condition from the thyrotoxic phase of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (&quot;Hashitoxicosis&quot;), or subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. The uptake will be elevated and seen in the multiple nodules. Some cases of toxic multinodular goiter have been shown to be the result of TSH receptor activating mutations, as described for solitary nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>In addition, approximately one-third of children with McCune-Albright syndrome develop hyperthyroidism and a multinodular goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. McCune-Albright syndrome, caused by an activating mutation of the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein, is characterized by caf&eacute;-au-lait pigmentary skin lesions, fibrous dysplasia of the bones, and precocious puberty. Again, while the hyperthyroidism can be treated with antithyroid drugs, eventually a more permanent form of treatment, such as surgical thyroidectomy or RAI ablation, must be considered.

Laboratory testing typically shows an elevated FT4 with a normal (not suppressed) TSH level. The diagnosis is made by finding a high serum TSH alpha subunit concentration, high alpha subunit to TSH ratio, and little or no TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). A pituitary adenoma is confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment is surgical resection.

Children commonly present with a goiter and elevated serum FT4 and, to a lesser extent, T3 levels, while TSH is normal or slightly elevated. The serum TSH alpha subunit is not elevated, and serum TSH will increase with TRH stimulation (although this product is no longer available in the United States). Children with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone are usually euthyroid, while those with preferential pituitary resistance may manifest thyrotoxic clinical features.</p><p>Attempts have been made to try to distinguish pituitary from generalized resistance to thyroid hormone by measuring other biochemical markers of hyperthyroidism (eg, serum cholesterol, ferritin, and sex hormone binding globulin) or by measuring the basal metabolic rate. Children with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone probably are not helped by any treatment. Children with more pituitary resistance may need some form of treatment of their hyperthyroidism, such as partial thyroidectomy or RAI ablation.

It is characterized by excessive thyroid hormone production, caused by thyrotropin (TSH) receptor-stimulating antibodies. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism include modest acceleration of linear growth and epiphyseal maturation, weight loss or failure to gain weight, excessive retraction of the eyelids causing lid lag and stare, diffuse goiter, tachycardia and increased cardiac output, increased gastrointestinal motility, proximal muscle weakness, tremor, hyperreflexia, sleep disturbance, distractibility with unexplained poor school performance, and emotional lability. Children with Graves' disease (but not those with other forms of hyperthyroidism) frequently have mild ophthalmopathy, with proptosis and a gritty sensation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism is suspected on the basis of the above clinical findings and confirmed by measurement of serum thyroid function tests. Serum TSH is suppressed and free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are elevated for age. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with suspected or confirmed hyperthyroidism, TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies (TSHR-Ab) should be measured. Measurement of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) is the most accurate measure of TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies. TSI will be positive in 60 to 94 percent of children with Graves' disease. If TSI is not elevated, then a radioactive iodine uptake (RAI) should be performed; elevated RAI with a diffuse pattern is typical of Graves' disease. Alternatively, some patients without an elevated TSI will have elevation of thyrotropin binding inhibitor immunoglobulin (TBII).
