Chemotherapy has a general goal of killing cells that are growing or dividing; chemotherapy reduces symptoms, improves quality of life, and prolongs survival in some patients with NSCLC.</p><p>An improved understanding of the molecular pathways that drive malignancy in NSCLC, as well as other neoplasms, led to the development of agents that target specific molecular pathways in malignant cells beginning in the early 2000s. The hope is that these agents will be able to preferentially kill malignant cells, but will be relatively innocuous to normal cells. Many established targeted therapies are administered as orally available small molecule kinase inhibitors, but targeted therapy can also be administered intravenously in the form of monoclonal antibodies or small molecules.</p><p>The identification of oncogenic activation of particular tyrosine kinases in some advanced NSCLC tumors, most notably mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (<em>EGFR</em>) or rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<em>ALK</em>) gene or <em>ROS1</em> gene, has led to a paradigm shift and the development of specific molecular treatments for patients. Furthermore, the identification of these patient subsets has led to an ongoing effort to identify biomarkers and treatments that can be used for other subsets of patients with advanced NSCLC. A general discussion of these alterations, as well as other potential driver mutations, is found in this topic. A treatment approach to advanced non-small cell lung cancer, as well as more detailed discussion regarding <em>EGFR</em>-mutated and <em>ALK</em>-translocated lung cancers, is found elsewhere. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-subsequent-systemic-therapy-for-previously-treated-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Subsequent systemic therapy for previously treated patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-with-an-activating-mutation-in-the-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with an activating mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase-alk-fusion-oncogene-positive-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene positive non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9880663\"><span class=\"h1\">DRIVER MUTATIONS AS BIOMARKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most useful biomarkers for predicting the efficacy of targeted therapy in advanced NSCLC are somatic genome alterations known as &quot;driver mutations.&quot; These mutations occur in cancer cells within genes encoding for proteins critical to cell growth and survival. Many other recurrent molecular alterations have been identified in NSCLC that are much less essential to maintain the oncogenic phenotype, and are often referred to as &quot;passenger mutations.&quot; Driver mutations are typically not found in the germline (noncancer) genome of the host and are usually mutually exclusive (ie, a cancer is unlikely to have more than one driver mutation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86507\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86507 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Driver mutations are typically transformative, which means that they initiate the evolution of a noncancerous cell to malignancy. In addition, driver mutations often impart an oncogene-addicted biology to the transformed cell, meaning that the mutated protein engenders reliance within the cancer cell to receive a signal from the driver in order to survive.</p><p>An often used analogy is that a normally functioning cell may have a particular switch in its circuitry that is sometimes turned on and sometimes turned off, but in general is regulated with feedback inhibition loops and specific stimulators. However, in an oncogene-addicted cancer cell, the switch is stuck in the on position all the time and is no longer subject to regulation.</p><p>Oncogene addiction tends to make driver mutations good biomarkers for selecting patients for targeted therapies. The extreme reliance of crucial downstream growth and survival pathways in the cell upon a single upstream signal that is &quot;stuck in the on position&quot; serves as an Achilles&rsquo; heel, making the cancer uniquely susceptible to down-regulation of signal originating from the driver (ie, unable to survive if a targeted drug essentially turns the switch to the off position because other mechanisms to keep downstream signals flowing are nonexistent).</p><p>In NSCLC, as well as with other malignancies, matching a specific targeted drug to the identified driver mutation for an individual patient has resulted in significantly improved therapeutic efficacy, often in conjunction with decreased toxicity. Screening for driver mutations thus has become an increasingly standard part of the diagnostic work-up for NSCLC, and the resultant information is useful in choosing between standard chemotherapy in the absence of a targetable driver mutation versus up-front targeted therapies. As examples, in a nationwide French study in which all lung cancers were subjected to molecular profiling, approximately 50 percent of tumors exhibited a genetic alteration, which led to use of a targeted agent as first-line therapy in half of these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The presence of a genetic alteration was associated with improved first-line progression-free survival (PFS, 10 versus 7.1 months) and overall survival (16.5 versus 11.8 months). Similarly, in the United States, the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium analyzed samples using multiplex genotyping from 733 patients with adenocarcinoma at 14 centers, identifying a targetable driver mutation in 466 cases (64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The 260 patients with an oncogenic driver who received a targeted agent had a median survival of 3.5 years; the 318 patients with a driver but without targeted therapy, 2.4 years; and the 360 patients without a driver, 2.1 years. These studies underscore the potential clinical benefit and prognostic utility provided by large-scale utilization of molecular profiling in lung cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9880670\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whenever feasible, patients with advanced NSCLC should have tumor assessed for the presence of a driver mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Guidelines from the College of American Pathologists (CAP), the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), and the Association of Molecular Pathologists (AMP) recommend analysis of either the primary tumor or of a metastasis for epidermal growth factor receptor (<em>EGFR</em>) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (<em>ALK</em>) for all patients whose tumor contains an element of adenocarcinoma, regardless of the clinical characteristics of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4850292\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methods for screening NSCLC patients for driver mutations and other abnormalities are continually evolving, and there is no single standard platform for testing. Features that make a platform clinically useful are fast turnaround time (two weeks or less); cost efficiency; ability to be performed on clinically available samples; and semi-automation, eliminating reliance upon a single operator. For newly diagnosed non-squamous NSCLC patients, we initially recommend testing for <em>EGFR</em> (by a polymerase chain reaction [PCR] method that takes &lt;2 weeks, on either tissue or blood); <em>ALK</em> (by immunohistochemistry [IHC] or fluorescence in-situ testing [FISH]); and <em>ROS1</em> (by FISH). Next generation sequencing can be performed in lieu of these tests, in parallel with these tests, or reflexed if these tests are all negative. Molecular testing can be performed on selected patients with squamous NSCLC, for example those with a light- or never-smoking history. We recommend programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) IHC testing on all patients, regardless of histology. </p><p>Techniques used commonly in the clinical setting are described below, with recommended testing for specific alterations summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111926\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111926 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sequencing </strong>&ndash; Clinical testing of mutations in lung cancer started historically with sequencing (or direct sequencing) of the gene, which examines the entire length of a single gene for the presence of a mutation. However, the sensitivity is lower than other methods that have since been more widely adopted. This is because the tumor cellularity with the mutation must be high (ideally higher than 10 percent) in the tissue sample in order to be detected by direct sequencing, otherwise the test may be falsely negative. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allele-specific testing </strong>&ndash; Allele-specific testing analyzes the DNA for a predefined abnormality, and largely replaced direct sequencing. Some centers use this as the default test to evaluate <em>EGFR</em> and other abnormalities. The raw DNA is typically amplified using PCR before the search for the mutated allele is undertaken, allowing for rare signals to be detected with greater sensitivity. This method represents a technological leap forward from direct sequencing in that it is a multiplexed test, and tends to be faster and cheaper than sequencing of each gene individually. However, only prespecified targets can be identified. Thus, allele-specific testing cannot be used to identify new abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Next-generation sequencing </strong>(NGS)<strong> </strong>&ndash; NGS overcomes many of the shortcomings of direct sequencing and allele-specific testing, and is rapidly becoming adopted by more centers. This massively parallel approach, relying heavily on automation, data storage, and computational processing, allows quantitative analysis of infrequent alleles and simultaneous evaluation of multiple genes or even whole genomes. It retains sensitivity even in specimens with low tumor cellularity, which is an improvement over direct sequencing, and can identify new abnormalities, which would not be detected by allele-specific testing. Moreover, NGS can often detect abnormalities that would historically be tested by FISH. We routinely use it in our clinical practice; however, it is costly and may not be covered by insurance for some patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluorescence in-situ testing (FISH) </strong>&ndash; FISH is typically used to detect gene translocations, amplifications, and other rearrangements, for example, <em>ALK</em> or <em>ROS1</em> translocations. Identifying rearrangements uses two hybridizing DNA probes of different colors that separate when two parts of a gene have broken apart. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics#H15538631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Fluorescence in situ hybridization'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunohistochemistry (IHC) </strong>&ndash; The role of IHC is evolving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. IHC is considered a sensitive and specific alternative to FISH in evaluating for <em>ALK</em> translocations. However, IHC is not currently recommended for the detection of other genomic alterations. In lung cancer IHC is also the definitive method to assess for PD-L1 protein staining, since PD-L1 protein expression does not appear to be related to known genomic alterations in the <em>PD-L1</em> gene. Tumor PD-L1 protein expression should be ordered in addition to tumor genotyping to determine first-line treatment options in NSCLC beyond chemotherapy.

There are currently two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tests for lung cancer patients, both in the <em>EGFR</em> mutation-positive setting. It is likely that as more data emerge, the use of liquid biopsies to assess other molecular abnormalities will become more widespread. (See <a href=\"#H3902134\" class=\"local\">'EGFR mutation'</a> below.) </p><p>The principle behind liquid biopsies is that cell-free ctDNA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are often present in the blood of patients with lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Platforms available for clinical use focus almost exclusively on isolating and detecting ctDNA, rather than CTCs. PCR<strong>-</strong>based platforms include allele-specific PCR, which preferentially amplifies a mutant DNA molecule over wildtype DNA, and emulsion PCR assays, which perform PCR reactions in thousands of droplets of a sample to quantify mutant and wildtype DNA (eg, droplet digital PCR and BEAMing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While such assays may have a theoretical turnaround time of as little as one day, they generally cover a limited number of common mutations, such as <em>EGFR</em>, <em>KRAS</em>, <em>BRAF</em>, and <em>ALK</em>. NGS-based plasma genotyping platforms are much broader in scope but currently take several weeks for results. In general, all of these methods are highly specific, although some platforms may detect allelic alterations that are present at such a low frequency that they may be clinically insignificant or represent low-level sequencing background noise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Liquid biopsies yield results that predict clinical response to targeted agents, although a limitation is that sensitivity ranges between 60 and 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. For example, in one study of 58 patients with <em>EGFR-</em>mutated NSCLC that acquired resistance to an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, T790M was assessed in plasma using BEAMing technology as well as in tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sensitivity of liquid biopsy for T790M was determined to be 70 percent, and patients were found to have similar response rates to the third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osimertinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">osimertinib</a>, regardless of whether the T790M mutation was found in plasma or solid tissue. The limited sensitivity of liquid biopsies is thought to reflect the biology that some cancers do not shed DNA into the bloodstream rather than a feature of any given assay. However, mutation detection in blood has been associated with more advanced disease characteristics, including worsened performance status and prognosis and the presence of more metastatic sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>A second limitation of liquid biopsies is that the types of studies have a higher chance of being falsely negative compared with traditional biopsies, given the minuscule and variable amounts of DNA that tumors may shed into circulation. Moreover, tests for programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression cannot be conducted on liquid biopsies.
