The GI system includes your:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophagus (the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small intestine (also known as the small bowel)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large intestine (also known as colon or large bowel)</p><p/><p>A GI bleed is when any of these organs start to bleed. Often you do not know you are bleeding, because it's happening inside your body. But sometimes there are signs that it is happening.</p><p>There are 2 common types of GI bleeds. &quot;Upper GI bleeds&quot; affect the esophagus, the stomach, and the first part of the small intestine. &quot;Lower GI bleeds&quot; affect the colon. Bleeding can also happen in the middle of the small intestine, but this is much less common. This is sometimes called &quot;mid-GI bleeding.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29049952\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a GI bleed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms are a bit different depending on whether you have an upper or lower GI bleed. Some people have no symptoms. They find out they have bleeding when a doctor or nurse does a rectal exam on them or a blood test shows they have anemia. (Anemia is when a person has too few red blood cells.)</p><p>The symptoms of an upper GI bleed can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting blood or something that looks like coffee grounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea or bowel movements that look like black tar (this can happen with lower GI bleeds, too, but it is less common)</p><p/><p>The symptoms of a lower GI bleed can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel movements that look bloody (this can happen with upper GI bleeds, too, but it is less common)</p><p/><p>Symptoms that can happen with either an upper or lower GI bleed include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling weak, light-headed, or woozy (especially if you lose a lot of blood)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A racing heartbeat (if you lose a lot of blood)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cramps or belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pale skin</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29049959\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomit blood or something that looks like coffee grounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a bowel movement that looks like tar or has blood in it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel weak, light-headed, or woozy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a racing heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turn much paler than normal</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29049966\"><span class=\"h1\">What can cause a GI bleed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of GI bleeds include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcers in the stomach or small intestines (ulcers are sores on the lining of the GI tract)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen veins in the esophagus called &quot;varices&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal blood vessels called &quot;arteriovenous malformations&quot; (or AVMs, for short)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diverticulosis (a condition in which tiny pouches form in the lining of the gut)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis (conditions that can cause sores to form in the lining of the gut)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins in the rectum (the lower part of the colon), or tears around the anus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer (rarely)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29049973\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a GI bleed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have a GI bleed, he or she will order 1 or more of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>See if you have enough red blood cells (the cells that carry oxygen)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>See if your blood is clotting normally</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>See if your liver is working normally</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An upper endoscopy &ndash; For this test, a doctor gives you medicine to make you sleepy and relaxed. Then he or she puts a thin tube called an endoscope in your mouth and down your throat. The tube has a light on the end and a camera that sends images of your GI tract to a TV screen. If the doctor sees any spots that are bleeding, he or she can use tools that go through the endoscope to help stop the bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A colonoscopy &ndash; This test is similar to an upper endoscopy, but it involves going in through the rectum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52258 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests that involve putting a dye or weakly radioactive chemical into the blood so that doctors can trace where the blood goes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A capsule endoscopy &ndash; This test uses a small camera about the size of a vitamin pill. You swallow the camera, and it sends pictures to a recording device that you wear on a belt for 8 hours. A doctor then looks at the pictures. This test lets doctors look at the small intestine, which is hard to see with upper endoscopy or colonoscopy because it is very long. After the test, the camera will pass with a bowel movement. Most people never see it come out.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29049980\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a GI bleed treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on how much blood you have lost and what seems to be causing your bleeding, you might get 1 or more of these treatments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen through a mask or a tube that sits under your nose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood or fluids into one of your veins (to replace blood you lost)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to reduce stomach acid</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines help clean out and empty your gut (so that doctors can see clearly what is happening inside)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small tube that goes up your nose and down your throat so doctors can rinse out your stomach</p><p/><p>Depending on where the bleed seems to be, you might also have an upper endoscopy, a colonoscopy, or both. This can help the doctors find the spot or spots that are bleeding. Plus, doctors can sometimes use the upper endoscope or colonoscope to seal off blood vessels and stop them from bleeding.</p><p>After the bleeding has stopped, your doctor or nurse will probably want to follow up with you to learn why you started bleeding in the first place. If you have ulcers or another condition that could lead to bleeding, the doctor or nurse will want to make sure those problems are treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29049987\"><span class=\"h1\">Can a GI bleed be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can lower your chances of getting a GI bleed by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not taking medicines called NSAIDs too often, unless your doctor tells you it is OK. These medicines can cause ulcers. Examples of NSAIDs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn). If you have to take these medicines on a regular basis, your doctor might give you another medicine to decrease your risk of bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being treated for stomach ulcers if you have them</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines called beta blockers if you have cirrhosis and your doctor prescribes them</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29050100\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-stools-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bloody stools (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peptic ulcers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiodysplasia-of-the-gi-tract-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Angiodysplasia of the GI tract (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-stools-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bloody stools in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-stool-rectal-bleeding-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood in the stool (rectal bleeding) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Peptic ulcer disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colonoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
