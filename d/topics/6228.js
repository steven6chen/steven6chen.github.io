This was subsequently termed the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, although earlier isolated case reports describing similar patients had been published. In 1943, the ECG features of preexcitation were correlated with anatomic evidence for the existence of anomalous bundles of conducting tissue that bypassed all or part of the normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69078 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will review the definition and prevalence of the WPW syndrome. The treatment options for patients with tachyarrhythmias and the WPW syndrome are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-symptomatic-arrhythmias-associated-with-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of symptomatic arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8470587\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal AV conduction versus accessory AV pathway conduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the normal heart, the atria and the ventricles are electrically isolated, with conduction of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles normally occurring via the atrioventricular node (AV) and the His-Purkinje system. Patients with a preexcitation syndrome have an additional pathway, known as an accessory pathway (AP), which directly connects the atria and ventricles, thereby allowing electrical activity to bypass the AV node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53343\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53343 \">table 1</a>). Tissue in the accessory pathways, which are congenital in origin and result from failure of resorption of the myocardial syncytium at the annulus fibrosis of the atrioventricular valves during fetal development, typically conducts electrical impulses more quickly than the AV node, resulting in the shorter PR interval seen on the surface ECG. (See <a href=\"#H13260510\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic findings'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lown-ganong-levine-syndrome-and-enhanced-atrioventricular-nodal-conduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome and enhanced atrioventricular nodal conduction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mahaim-fiber-tachycardias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mahaim fiber tachycardias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been estimated that most accessory pathways (60 to 75 percent) are capable of bidirectional conduction (anterograde and retrograde) between the atrium and ventricle. However, some accessory pathways (17 to 37 percent) are only capable of conduction in a retrograde fashion from ventricle to atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. When accessory pathways conduct exclusively in the retrograde direction (so-called &quot;concealed&quot; accessory pathways), they do not generate a delta wave and the WPW pattern on the surface ECG but are still capable of supporting reentrant tachycardia. Retrograde conduction can occur following ventricular pacing or premature beats, and it can form the retrograde arm of an orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) circuit. The vast majority of concealed accessory pathways are left-sided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The mechanism responsible for unidirectional conduction along an accessory pathway (anterograde only or retrograde only) remains undetermined.

In either situation, anterograde conduction through the accessory pathway results in earlier activation, or preexcitation, of part of the ventricles. The classic electrocardiographic pattern in the WPW pattern and syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75578\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef75578 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76226\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef76226 \">waveform 2</a>) has two major features: a shortened PR interval and a widened QRS complex due to a delta wave. The ECG findings are discussed in greater detail. (See <a href=\"#H13260510\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic findings'</a> below.)</p><p>Multiple accessory pathways are present in as many as 13 percent of patients referred to an electrophysiologist because of the WPW syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The probability is increased in subjects with a family history of preexcitation, as well in as patients with Ebstein's malformation of the tricuspid valve and certain forms of cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

The most frequent locations are left lateral (50 percent), posteroseptal (30 percent), right anteroseptal (10 percent), and right lateral (10 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-pathophysiology-and-localization-of-accessory-pathways-in-the-preexcitation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy, pathophysiology, and localization of accessory pathways in the preexcitation syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many studies have attempted to correlate the site of the accessory pathway with the ECG pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. However, the electrocardiographic appearance of activation depends upon the extent of preexcitation and fusion and, as a result, the same pathway may not always produce the same ECG pattern. Furthermore, up to 13 percent of individuals with preexcitation have more than one accessory pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p>In spite of the somewhat variable ECG findings associated with conduction over the accessory pathway, a left lateral pathway generally presents with a pseudo-lateral wall myocardial infarction (MI) pattern (Q wave in leads I and aVL), and a posteroseptal pathway most often presents with a pseudo-inferior wall MI pattern (Q wave in leads II, III and aVF).

Ebstein's anomaly is the congenital lesion most strongly associated with WPW syndrome. As many as 10 to 20 percent of such patients have one or more accessory pathway; the majority of these are located in the right free wall and right posteroseptal spaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

AF generally originates within the atria or pulmonary veins, independent of the accessory pathway, but the accessory pathway functions as another route for the conduction of atrial impulses to the ventricles. However, the 10 to 30 percent frequency with which intermittent AF occurs in patients with the WPW syndrome is striking because of the low prevalence of coexisting structural heart disease, which is a major predisposing factor for AF in subjects without an accessory pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/18,40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,40,42</a>].

This is termed a <strong>delta wave</strong>. The more rapid the conduction along the accessory pathway, the greater the amount of myocardium depolarized via the accessory pathway, resulting in a more prominent or wider delta wave, and increasing prolongation of the QRS complex.</p><p/><p>Some accessory pathways do not conduct antegrade to the ventricles but instead are able to conduct retrograde from the ventricle to the atrium. Because there is no antegrade conduction over the accessory pathway, the characteristic ECG findings of the WPW pattern are absent. The diagnosis in patients with a concealed accessory pathway can only be made following ventricular ectopy or ventricular pacing or during electrophysiologic testing.

One such pathway, sometimes referred to as a &quot;Mahaim fiber,&quot; is now better understood to be an atriofascicular pathway. These pathways are found along the right lateral atrioventricular groove and run as a long conduction fiber along the right ventricular free-wall to approximate (or possibly connect to) the distal portion of the right bundle branch. Atriofascicular pathways only conduct in the anterograde direction but can participate in antidromic tachycardia using the normal conduction tissues as the retrograde limb of a circuit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61702\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61702 \">figure 3</a>).

In most instances, EPS is <strong>not</strong> required to make the diagnosis of WPW pattern or syndrome, but EPS is sometimes combined with mapping and transcatheter ablation of the accessory pathway for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes during the same session. We proceed with EPS in situations when the diagnosis is uncertain based on the surface ECG, for risk stratification purposes when a higher risk would alter the approach to therapy, and as part of a therapeutic catheter ablation procedure. Thus, for symptomatic patients with a history of one or more tachycardia events and manifest preexcitation on their ECG, EPS with ablation is now routinely offered early in the course of management as a potentially definitive treatment for the condition.

Conditions such as cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, significant valvular disease, and congenital heart defects will decrease tolerance to any abnormal rhythm and increase patient risk. Mapping and ablation will usually be done in all such cases to simplify cardiac management.

Before proceeding with EPS for this purpose, it may be possible to estimate risk in some cases by less invasive means. The observation of an abrupt and unambiguous loss of preexcitation at faster sinus rates on ECG, Holter monitor, or exercise testing may be a sufficient sign that the accessory pathway has limited anterograde conduction potential and is unlikely to result in life-threatening ventricular rates during atrial fibrillation. Expert consensus is that these &quot;low-risk&quot; patients can usually be followed without invasive testing as long as they remain asymptomatic. </p><p>If preexcitation persists at maximum heart rates during exercise testing, it does not necessarily mean that the patient is &quot;high-risk,&quot; but rather that the risk cannot be determined by noninvasive means. A decision to proceed to EPS in these indeterminate cases for better resolution of accessory pathway profile must be made on a case-by-case basis with careful discussion between clinician and patient.

Intermittent preexcitation or loss of preexcitation may be seen in the following settings:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Resting ECG</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At increased heart rates during exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Following intravenous administration of a sodium channel blocker, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One suggested approach in asymptomatic patients is to perform noninvasive studies (eg, exercise testing or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> challenge) to identify those at low risk who would require no further evaluation or treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/11,49,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,49,55</a>]. Patients without these low-risk findings, particularly those under age 35 to 40, could then consider further risk stratification and treatment with invasive EP study.

Among a cohort of 224 asymptomatic patients with ventricular preexcitation, 76 patients aged 35 years or less were found to have inducible atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia or atrial fibrillation during EP study and were randomly assigned to catheter ablation (37 patients, median follow-up 27 months) of the accessory pathway or no therapy (35 patients, median follow-up 21 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In the ablation group, only two patients (5 percent) had arrhythmic events, both due to a mechanism that was unrelated to the ablated accessory pathway (atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia), while in the control group, 21 patients (60 percent) had arrhythmic events (VF in one patient, supraventricular tachycardia in 15 patients, and AF in five patients). The five-year estimated incidence of arrhythmic events was significantly lower for patients treated with ablation than for controls (7 versus 77 percent).</p><p/><p>A 2015 systematic review of asymptomatic patients with the WPW pattern, which included patients from six studies (one randomized trial of ablation versus no ablation in 76 patients and five prospective cohorts which included 883 patients who did not undergo ablation), reported the likelihood of arrhythmic events over a range of follow-up as long as eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Among the 76 patients randomized to ablation or no ablation, the five-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of arrhythmic events was 7 percent in the ablation group compared with 77 percent in the group who did not undergo ablation. Among the 883 patients in the cohort studies who did not undergo ablation, most patients had an uneventful course, but up to 9 percent developed malignant AF (RR interval &le;250 milliseconds), and up to 2 percent experienced VF. </p><p>In summary, initial risk-stratification with EP study successfully identified those with a higher likelihood of developing symptoms, and treatment of these high risk patients with ablation reduced arrhythmic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, life-threatening arrhythmias were rare in the absence of ablation and serious complications developed in 2 percent of patients undergoing risk stratification.

WPW syndrome results from an accessory pathway that directly connects the atria and ventricles and bypasses the AV node. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most accessory pathways are capable of antegrade conduction (either antegrade conduction alone or bidirectional conduction) from atrium to ventricle; however, some accessory pathways conduct only in a retrograde fashion from ventricle to atrium. Because there is no antegrade conduction through the accessory pathway, the characteristic WPW ECG pattern is absent, and the pathway is considered to be &quot;concealed.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H8470587\" class=\"local\">'Normal AV conduction versus accessory AV pathway conduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accessory pathway may be located anywhere along the AV ring (groove) or in the septum. The most frequent locations are left lateral (50 percent), posteroseptal (30 percent), right anteroseptal (10 percent), and right lateral (10 percent). (See <a href=\"#H13260635\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of a WPW pattern on the surface ECG is estimated at 0.13 to 0.25 percent in the general population. The WPW pattern on the ECG may be intermittent and may even disappear permanently over time, depending on the conduction properties of the accessory pathway. The prevalence of the WPW syndrome (WPW pattern plus tachyarrhythmia) is substantially lower than that of the WPW pattern alone, perhaps as low as two percent of patients with the WPW pattern on surface ECG. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of WPW pattern'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of WPW syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic ECG pattern of preexcitation in sinus rhythm is characterized by a fusion between conduction via the accessory pathway and the normal AV <span class=\"nowrap\">node/His-Purkinje</span> system, resulting in the following ECG characteristics (see <a href=\"#H13260510\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiographic findings'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The PR interval is short (less than 0.12 sec) due to rapid AV conduction through the accessory pathway and bypass of the atrioventricular node.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The initial part of ventricular activation is slowed, and the upstroke of the QRS complex is slurred because of slow muscle fiber-to-muscle fiber conduction; this is termed a <strong>delta wave.</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The QRS complex is widened and consists of fusion between early ventricular activation caused by preexcitation with the later ventricular activation resulting from transmission through the AV node and the infranodal conduction system to the ventricles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with the WPW pattern on their electrocardiogram (ECG) remain asymptomatic, although a small percentage of patients with the WPW pattern develop arrhythmias as a part of the WPW syndrome. Most patients who develop an arrhythmia will present with palpitations, with syncope or sudden cardiac death occurring much less frequently. (See <a href=\"#H29400384\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachycardias associated with the WPW syndrome can be classified into those in which the accessory pathway is necessary for initiation and maintenance of the tachycardia and those in which the bypass tract acts as a &quot;bystander,&quot; providing a route of conduction from the anatomic site of tachycardia origin to other regions of the heart:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atrioventricular reentrant (or reciprocating) tachycardia (AVRT) is a reentrant tachycardia with an anatomically defined circuit that consists of two distinct pathways, the normal AV conduction system and an AV accessory pathway, linked by common proximal (the atria) and distal (the ventricles) tissues. The two major forms of AVRT are orthodromic and antidromic AVRT, defined by the direction of conduction through the AV node and the accessory pathway. (See <a href=\"#H29400309\" class=\"local\">'Tachycardias requiring an accessory pathway for initiation and maintenance'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-reentrant-tachycardia-avrt-associated-with-an-accessory-pathway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs in 10 to 30 percent of persons with the WPW syndrome, somewhat higher than might be expected given the low prevalence of coexisting structural heart disease. When atrial impulses are transmitted along the accessory pathway in AF, ventricular rates may exceed 300 beats per minute and can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (VF). (See <a href=\"#H8472027\" class=\"local\">'Atrial fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In most cases, VF occurring in patients with the WPW syndrome results from the rapid ventricular response during AF which has persisted and ultimately deteriorated into VF. Although the frequency with which AF with rapid AV conduction via an accessory pathway degenerates into VF is unknown, the incidence of sudden death in patients with the WPW syndrome is quite low. (See <a href=\"#H8471569\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular fibrillation and sudden death'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of WPW pattern can nearly always be made by reviewing the surface ECG. In addition, in some rare circumstances invasive electrophysiology testing can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of an accessory pathway. WPW syndrome is diagnosed following the development of an arrhythmia in a patient with a pre-existing WPW pattern on ECG. (See <a href=\"#H249535\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications for electrophysiologic study (EPS) in patients with known or suspected WPW syndrome are still evolving. In most instances, EPS is <strong>not</strong> required to make the diagnosis of WPW pattern or syndrome, but EPS is sometimes combined with mapping and transcatheter ablation of the accessory pathway for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes during the same session. We proceed with EPS in situations when the diagnosis is uncertain based on the surface ECG, for risk stratification purposes when a higher risk would alter the approach to therapy, and as part of a therapeutic catheter ablation procedure. (See <a href=\"#H7844175\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiology testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The electrocardiographic (ECG) findings in persons with the WPW pattern can be similar to ECG findings seen in other cardiac conditions, including prior myocardial infarction, ventricular premature beats, idioventricular rhythm, and bundle branch block. (See <a href=\"#H13260518\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis of ECG findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For certain asymptomatic patients with preexcitation, including children, those with a very short refractory period of the accessory pathway, and those in high-risk professions involving risk to themselves and others, we suggest electrophysiology study and ablation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
