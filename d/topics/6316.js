The supporting data include clinical studies that demonstrate cardiovascular structural and functional changes in children with HTN and autopsy studies that have shown an association of blood pressure (BP) with atherosclerotic changes in the aorta and heart in children and young adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-development-of-atherosclerosis-in-childhood#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and development of atherosclerosis in childhood&quot;, section on 'Hypertension'</a>.)</p><p>In hypertensive adults, multiple randomized trials have shown that reduction of BP by antihypertensive therapy reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
