Emergence delirium (ED) may be distressing to the patient, parents, and caregivers, and can result in inadvertent removal of intravenous catheters, drains, and dressings, and rarely, self-harm. This topic will discuss the definition, risk factors, prevention, and treatment of ED and agitation in children. ED in adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed emergence and emergence delirium in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3148529437\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergence delirium (ED) is an altered state of consciousness, which begins with emergence from anesthesia and continues through the early recovery period. ED is a disturbance of awareness of, or attention to, the child's environment, and manifests as disorientation, hyperactive behavior, and hypersensitivity in the immediate period after anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Agitation related to pain is not considered ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2106909430\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of emergence delirium (ED) and agitation in children is unclear, and is reported from 10 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The incidence of ED varies with the choice of anesthetic agent, age of the child, and especially with the criteria used to diagnose of ED. In particular, in young patients, agitation due to <strong>pain</strong> can be confused with ED. In our experience, incomplete pain relief remains the most common cause of inconsolable behavior in the recovery room and is far more common than ED.</p><p>When all factors are considered, we believe that ED may occur in as many as 30 to 50 percent of children who have general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In order for the diagnosis of ED to be made, however, pain must be completely controlled.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1094897979\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism responsible for emergence delirium (ED) and for its increase in frequency in preschool-age children remain poorly understood. A variety of explanations have been proposed. Some experts have attributed ED to the unique neurodevelopmental characteristics in this age group and the effects of the newer ether anesthetics on them. Alternately, some associate ED with the unique electroencephalographic (EEG) findings associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> anesthesia. However, ED occurs with a similar frequency after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a> even though the EEG of these inhaled anesthetics are quite dissimilar from sevoflurane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Several functional brain changes have been observed in children who developed ED, but these findings require verification and further study.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>EEG changes</strong> &ndash; In one study of EEG during emergence from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> anesthesia, children with ED awoke with delirious behavior before the normal sleep or wake EEG patterns occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In an EEG study of children given sevoflurane anesthesia, the children with ED did not pass through the sleep <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drowsy EEG states that were observed before awakening in the children without ED.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brain metabolism</strong> &ndash; A spectroscopy study in 59 children suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> but not <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> is associated with altered metabolism in some parts of the brain, which in turn is associated with a greater risk of ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>Animal studies implicate excitation of the locus coeruleus in the pathogenesis of ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This mechanism appears to be supported by the fact that alpha<sub>2</sub> agonists, which are effective for preventing ED, work primarily at the locus coeruleus</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25770308\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for emergence delirium (ED) in children include preschool age and the choice of anesthetic agent. Speed of emergence from anesthesia and depth of anesthesia do not appear to predispose to ED. The effect of preoperative anxiety on risk of ED is unclear. In our experience, a prior episode of ED is not a risk factor for ED with a subsequent anesthetic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109277\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109277 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14348821\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies using different diagnostic tools have reported that preschool-age children (ie, two to six years of age) are more likely to experience ED than older children, with many studies reporting an incidence of 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/5,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13-15</a>]. The incidence of ED decreases with increasing age, with a frequency in adults of 4 to 20 percent depending on the definition and timing of the ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

Another meta-analysis including nonrandomized and randomized studies (158 studies, greater than 14,000 children) also reported a lower risk of ED with propofol compared with sevoflurane (relative [RR] 0.35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The mechanism for the increase in ED after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> compared with other anesthetics is unknown. Rapid emergence from general anesthesia does not appear to be responsible. In one study, no difference in the incidence of ED was noted in children randomly assigned to rapid emergence with immediate discontinuation of sevoflurane versus controlled, gradual reduction of sevoflurane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In another study, there was a six-fold greater incidence of ED after sevoflurane anesthesia compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a> anesthesia (24 versus 4 percent), despite similarly rapid emergence in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The newer, less soluble volatile anesthetic agents (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>) are associated with an increase in the incidence of ED compared with halothane, a more soluble agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/7,20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20,23</a>]. A meta-analysis of 23 randomized trials including 2300 patients comparing halothane with sevoflurane reported an increase in emergence agitation with sevoflurane (pooled OR 2.21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Halothane is infrequently used in pediatric anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2419581178\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When pain is prevented or adequately treated, the type of surgical procedure probably does not affect the risk of ED. Studies that have shown an association between specific procedures and an increase in ED (eg, tonsillectomy, urologic surgery without neuraxial analgesia, strabismus surgery) may have reported pain-related behavior as ED.</p><p>The incidence of ED after a pain-free procedure (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) appears to be similar to that which is reported for surgical procedures when pain was controlled. In a small study, 32 children who underwent MRI were randomized to receive general anesthesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> or halothane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The incidence of ED with sevoflurane when a high diagnostic threshold was applied (similar to the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium [PAED] scale) was 33 percent, compared with 0 percent with halothane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3971918672\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration and depth of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of deep anesthesia (bispectral index [BIS] &lt;45) does not correlate with the risk for developing ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].<sup> </sup>ED is as likely to occur after brief procedures (eg, myringotomy and tubes) as it is after surgeries of greater duration.</p><p>Neither the depth of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] nor the duration of deep sevoflurane anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], as assessed by BIS monitoring, affects the incidence of ED in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3464598952\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association between preoperative mental status and the development of ED is unclear, and studies have shown conflicting results. One retrospective study including approximately 800 anesthetized children reported a correlation between more preoperative anxiety and the odds of developing ED, as measured by a three-level delirium scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, two other studies found no relationship between preoperative anxiety and ED, as measured by the PAED scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2919969560\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergence delirium (ED) is a clinical diagnosis that is based on a composite of behaviors that are present during the postoperative period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4071444401\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the episode, children with ED exhibit non-purposeful movement and fail to establish eye contact or to interact normally with parents or caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They commonly avert their eyes or stare, and exhibit non-purposeful movement. The child with ED is agitated, inconsolable, squirming, and sometimes flailing his or her arms, and often attempts to remove the monitors, ripping and grabbing at them as if they are irritating or causing pain. However, removing the monitors does not attenuate the child's delirium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2896456681\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other conditions that may require treatment can produce the signs and symptoms of ED. Most agitation and inconsolable behavior in young children in the recovery room is related to pain, rather than ED. ED and agitation from pain can co-occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The differential diagnosis for ED in the recovery room is shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109429 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>ED usually resolves within 20 minutes of onset; one study reported a mean duration of delirium of approximately six minutes after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> anesthesia for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263276359\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergence delirium rating scales</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of rating scales have been developed for the diagnosis of ED to differentiate ED from postoperative pain and to allow accurate assessment of prevalence, predisposing factors, and prevention and treatment strategies. Currently, the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale is recognized as the standard for diagnosing ED in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The PAED scale consists of five behaviors, each of which is rated on a five-level scale with a score of zero to four (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109276 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The scores are added to achieve a total scale score (maximum value is 20). The PAED score has been validated, with a score of 10 or greater yielding 64 percent sensitivity and 86 percent specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and a score of &gt;12 yielding 100 percent sensitivity and 94.5 percent specificity for the diagnosis of ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The PAED scale is <strong>not</strong> a continuous, linear scale. While a score of &ge;10 makes it highly likely that a child has ED, a score of 5 does not mean that the diagnosis is half as likely. Similarly, a child with a score of 18 may be<em> </em>no more likely to have ED than a child with a score of 10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The diagnostic accuracy of the PAED score is the subject of ongoing research.</p><p>Other rating scales, including the Watcha and Cravero scales, have not been validated. A study that compared the Watcha, Cravero, and PAED scales with each other and with ED diagnosed by an experienced anesthesiologist reported that all these methods correlated well for diagnosing ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Observer bias may have affected the results of this study, as the PAED score was always scored first, and a single unblinded observer performed all ratings.</p><p>Some of the behavioral factors that are included in ED rating scales may have higher predictive value than others. The first three factors in the PAED scale (ie, child makes eye contact, purposeful actions, and awareness of surroundings) track very closely with ED and poorly with pain, whereas the last two factors (ie, restlessness and inconsolability) track poorly with both ED and pain and are therefore minor factors in the diagnosis of ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergence-delirium-and-agitation-in-children/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>]. Both the Watcha and Cravero scales require one or more of these minor factors for the diagnosis of ED, thus reducing the accuracy of these scales.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3361151633\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most effective preventive measure for emergence delirium (ED) is to avoid the use of the potent inhalation anesthetics (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>), and instead to administer total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). This would constitute a significant departure from the usual practice of pediatric anesthesia in some centers for a potentially brief side effect that is unlikely to occur.</p><p>We do not routinely administer prophylaxis for ED because the incidence of ED in our practice is low. In addition, we do not provide prophylaxis when a parent reports previous ED in the child; ED is age-dependent and in our experience may not recur. Others administer a variety of medications as prophylaxis for ED. For clinicians in centers where the prevalence of ED in the recovery room is substantive, reasonable preventative strategies include a dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">propofol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>, or an alpha<sub>2</sub> agonist before the end of surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109281 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>A number of ED preventive interventions have been studied for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> anesthesia, which are administered during induction, maintenance, or emergence from anesthesia. The choice of preventive strategies may be based on patient factors and clinician preference. Doses and timing of administration that have been studied and the effectiveness for prevention of ED are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109281\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109281 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Propofol</a><strong> </strong>&ndash; Administration of propofol near the end of surgery during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> anesthesia is a reasonable approach to prevention of ED in either pain-free procedures or procedures in which pain has been controlled intraoperatively.
