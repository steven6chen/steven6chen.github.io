The anus is the last part of the digestive system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>). It is where bowel movements leave the body.</p><p>Anal itching can cause discomfort and embarrassment. Some people think it means they have colon cancer. But anal itching is usually caused by something else.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94192171\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes anal itching?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many possible causes of anal itching, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Part of a bowel movement that gets stuck to the skin around the anus &ndash; This is more likely to happen if you have diarrhea or soft bowel movements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhoids &ndash; These are swollen veins in the rectum. They can also cause pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain foods or drinks, which can irritate the anus, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coffee, tea, beer, and cola</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chocolate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tomatoes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Citrus fruits, such as oranges or grapefruit</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases that affect the anus, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An anal abscess &ndash; This is a lump that happens when a gland inside the anus gets infected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An anal fistula &ndash; This is a tunnel that forms between the anal gland and the place where the abscess is on the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cancer &ndash; Some people who get anal, rectal, or colon cancer have anal itching.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin diseases, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Psoriasis &ndash; A skin condition that can cause a rash and itching.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dermatitis &ndash; A skin rash that can happen after your skin touches something that irritates it or something you are allergic to. This could be a skin cream, laundry detergent, or something else that touches the area around your anus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases caused by infection with a bacteria or fungus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94192188\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to get rid of anal itching?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are some things you can try. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping the anus and skin around it clean and dry &ndash; You can:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wipe gently after a bowel movement, using a moist pad or tissue</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>NOT use a cleaning lotion, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=witch-hazel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">witch hazel</a> &ndash; This can make symptoms worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Take a bath after you have a bowel movement &ndash; Use mild, unscented soap. Pat the area dry with a soft towel or use a hair dryer on the cool setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Put some unscented talcum powder on the skin around the anus &ndash; This can help keep the area dry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting an anti-itch ointment on the area &ndash; You can use an over-the-counter <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydrocortisone</a> cream (sample brand names: Preparation H, Anu-med HC). But do not use anti-itch cream for more than 2 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">zinc oxide</a> skin ointment or paste on the area (sample brand names: Desitin, Balmex)</p><p/><p>If the itching is worse at night, you can take medicines called antihistamines (sample brand names: Benadryl, Aler-Cap).</p><p>You can also try NOT eating or drinking things that can cause anal itching or diarrhea. For example, some people get diarrhea when they drink milk or eat foods made with milk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94192205\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about your symptoms. You might also have the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; If the doctor or nurse finds a growth, he or she will take a small sample of tissue from the area. Another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope to check for cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonoscopy &ndash; This test looks at the inside lining of a person's large intestine, called the &quot;colon.&quot; During a colonoscopy, the doctor puts a tube with a tiny camera into your anus and up to your colon. This lets the doctor look for cancer or other problems. Before a colonoscopy, you get medicine to make you relax.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94192222\"><span class=\"h1\">How is anal itching treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a medical condition is causing the anal itching, doctors can treat that condition. This usually gets rid of the itching.</p><p>A few people have anal itching even after trying different things to stop it. If this happens, doctors can give other ointments and in rare cases an injection (shot) of medicine around the anus. This can stop the itching.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94192237\"><span class=\"h1\">Can anal itching be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting anal itching by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping the area around the anus clean and dry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NOT eating foods that can cause anal itching or diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94192252\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhoids (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-abscess-and-fistula-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anal abscess and fistula (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pinworms-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pinworms (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-fissure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anal fissure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemorrhoids (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
