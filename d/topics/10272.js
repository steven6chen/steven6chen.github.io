The roles of testosterone, which directly stimulates Wolffian duct differentiation, and dihydrotestosterone, which causes development of the external genitalia in male sexual differentiation, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal sexual development&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURE OF THE TESTES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The testes contain two anatomical units:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A network of seminiferous tubules in which inhibin B and anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone are synthesized by Sertoli cells and sperm are produced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An interstitium containing Leydig cells that produce androgens and peritubular myoid cells.</p><p/><p>The spermatogenic tubules are composed of germ cells and Sertoli cells. Tight junctions between the Sertoli cells separate the tissue into two functional compartments (basal and adluminal), which are distinct from the anatomical units and which have limited permeability for diffusion of macromolecules between them (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69256\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69256 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The <strong>basal</strong> compartment consists of the outer layers of the seminiferous tubules containing the spermatogonia. The <strong>adluminal</strong> compartment contains the inner portion of the seminiferous tubules, including primary spermatocytes and more advanced stages of spermatogenesis.</p><p>As spermatogenesis begins, the spermatogonia pass through the tight junctions between Sertoli cells so that the Sertoli cell cytoplasm encompasses the differentiating spermatocytes and spermatids as they move toward the lumen of the tubules. The seminiferous tubules empty into a network of ducts termed the rete testes, through which the sperm move to the epididymis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-TESTICULAR AXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hypothalamus communicates with the anterior pituitary via a portal vascular system and by neural pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68189 \">figure 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothalamic-pituitary-axis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothalamic-pituitary axis&quot;</a>). The medial basal region of the hypothalamus (particularly the arcuate nucleus) contains neurons that secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in a pulsatile fashion into the hypothalamic-pituitary portal system, by the so-called GnRH pulse generator. Several hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines modulate GnRH secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68189 \">figure 2</a>). Kisspeptin and its receptor, <em>KISS1R </em>(also called <em>GPR54</em>), are also important in GnRH secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of gonadotropin-releasing hormone&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">GnRH actions in the pituitary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the hypophyseal portal system in turn elicits pulsatile secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the gonadotroph cells of the anterior pituitary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The pulsatility of GnRH secretion is essential for the stimulation of LH and FSH release; continuous administration of GnRH or GnRH agonists inhibits gonadotropin release (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51212\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51212 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>LH and FSH are composed of two glycoprotein chains. The alpha subunits of the two chains are identical; distinct immunologic and functional characteristics of the two hormones are conveyed by the unique beta subunits.</p><p>GnRH binds to cell surface receptors on the pituitary gonadotrophs to stimulate the release of both LH and FSH by a calcium-dependent mechanism that is independent of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and that may involve diacylglycerols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The amount of LH and FSH released depends upon the frequency and magnitude of the GnRH pulses and responsiveness of the pituitary to GnRH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonadotropin actions in the testes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LH interacts with receptors on the Leydig cell membrane to stimulate adenyl cyclase and the formation and release of cAMP. cAMP activates the catalytic subunit of a protein kinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and through a series of incompletely understood intermediate steps enhances testosterone synthesis.</p><p>FSH interacts with receptors on the basal aspect of the Sertoli cell membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] to stimulate cAMP generation and activate protein kinase. As a result, the synthesis of several proteins is enhanced, including androgen binding protein (ABP) and the aromatase enzyme (<em>CYP19</em>) that converts testosterone to estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The mechanism by which FSH regulates spermatogenesis is incompletely understood (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Feedback control of gonadotropin secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In men, LH secretion is regulated primarily by negative feedback, as normal concentrations of gonadal steroids inhibit LH secretion. Testosterone can be converted to estradiol by <em>CYP19</em> in the brain and the pituitary, but the two hormones are thought to regulate gonadotropin secretion independently. Estradiol appears to be more important than testosterone in the regulation of FSH secretion in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but aromatization of testosterone does not appear to be required for negative feedback control of LH synthesis because dihydrotestosterone, an androgen that cannot be aromatized, also inhibits LH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The fact that LH levels are elevated in men with aromatase deficiency and following the administration of aromatase inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] implies that estradiol action is involved in LH feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Testosterone acts on the hypothalamus to slow the hypothalamic pulse generator and decrease LH pulse frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], probably by a mechanism involving endogenous opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Testosterone also appears to inhibit LH release directly at the level of the pituitary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some of these effects may be mediated by the local conversion of testosterone to estradiol. In adult men, estrogen inhibits LH secretion both by decreasing GnRH pulse frequency at the level of the hypothalamus and by reducing the amplitude of LH pulses by impairing pituitary responsiveness to GnRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Feedback control of FSH secretion involves both peptide and steroid hormones. The serum FSH concentration increases with loss of germinal elements in the testis without a concomitant increase in LH concentration. Inhibin B, a peptide inhibitor of pituitary FSH secretion that is produced by germ cells beginning at puberty, is a glycoprotein consisting of two disulfide-linked subunits, alpha and beta. Because the beta subunit can exist in two forms (A and B), there are two forms of inhibin, inhibin A and inhibin B. Inhibin B is the physiologically important hormone in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Both FSH and androgen are required for normal inhibin B secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Inhibin B blocks GnRH-stimulated FSH release, and in the castrated rhesus monkey inhibin is capable of returning FSH levels to normal in the absence of testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. An inverse relationship between inhibin B and FSH level occurs across a wide range of FSH concentrations in normal and infertile men. In adult men, the level of inhibin B correlates with the presence of germ cells in early spermatogenesis rather than with the presence of Sertoli cells as seen before puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is exquisitely sensitive to stressors. Acute and chronic illnesses lower testosterone levels as a result of increased corticotropin releasing hormone and cytokine release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Fasting reduces testosterone levels in healthy men by acutely lowering levels of leptin, which is required for normal pulse generator activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68189 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ANDROGEN SYNTHESIS, TRANSPORT, METABOLISM, AND ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The synthesis and metabolism of testosterone to the active metabolites, 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone and 17-beta-estradiol, are diagrammed in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65690 \">figure 4</a>).

A single <em>CYP17</em> enzyme possesses both 17-alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities; the mechanisms by which the two enzymatic functions are controlled are poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], but mutations in different parts of the gene can influence the two processes selectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Approximately 25 mcg of testosterone are present in the normal testes, and on average, 5 to 10 mg of testosterone are secreted daily in a pulsatile fashion under the control of LH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In normal young men sleep-induced increases in testosterone cause testosterone levels to peak in the early morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Additional factors that influence Leydig cell function include insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), transforming growth factors alpha and beta, epidermal growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Testosterone metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testosterone can be converted to 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone, which mediates many of the differentiative, growth-promoting, and functional aspects of androgen action in males (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65690\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65690 \">figure 4</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal sexual development&quot;</a>). Alternatively, testosterone can be aromatized to estrogens, which exert effects that are independent of, opposite to, or synergistic to those of androgens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Circulating dihydrotestosterone is formed principally in androgen target tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In normal men, dihydrotestosterone formation accounts for approximately 6 to 8 percent of testosterone metabolism, and the ratio of plasma testosterone to dihydrotestosterone approximates 10 to 15:1. A number of delta-4, 3-keto-steroids can be 5-alpha-reduced, a reaction that is physiologically irreversible. There are two separate 5-alpha-reductase isoenzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. 5-alpha-reductase type 1 is expressed in liver and nongenital skin. 5-alpha-reductase type 2 is expressed in the male urogenital tract, genital skin, and liver and is defective in subjects with 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=steroid-5-alpha-reductase-2-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The principal role of dihydrotestosterone formation appears to be amplification of the androgen signal, presumably because of the higher affinity of dihydrotestosterone for binding to the androgen receptor (AR) (most easily demonstrated as a slower dissociation rate of the dihydrotestosterone-AR complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]). The strongest evidence for this concept is the fact that targeted disruption of both steroid 5-alpha-reductase enzymes in the mouse does not impair virilization because it is associated with a profound increase in testosterone levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The dihydrotestoterone-AR complex may also exert some unique role(s) in male physiology.</p><p>Estrogens act in concert with androgens to inhibit gonadotropin secretion (see above) and to promote bone maturation in the adolescent boy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Estrogen excess in men can be either relative or absolute and is usually manifested by breast enlargement (gynecomastia). Androgens act in the breast to inhibit the actions of estrogens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-causes-of-gynecomastia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and causes of gynecomastia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Of the 50 mcg of estradiol formed daily in normal adult men, approximately 85 percent is synthesized in extraglandular tissues, and the remainder in the testes. The conversion of androgens to estrogens in testis and in extraglandular tissues is catalyzed by the same <em>CYP19</em> present in the placenta and ovary, a microsomal enzyme whose expression is determined by tissue specific promoters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Adipose tissue is the most significant site of estrogen formation in normal men, and the overall rate of estrogen synthesis in extraglandular tissue rises with increasing body weight and advancing age. Increases in the serum LH concentration enhance the secretion of estradiol by the testes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Transport of gonadal steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gonadal steroids are transported in the plasma largely bound to albumin and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG, also called testosterone-binding globulin or TeBG). In normal men, approximately 2 percent of plasma testosterone is free or unbound, 44 percent is bound to SHBG, and 54 percent is bound to albumin and other proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although it has approximately 1000-fold lower affinity for testosterone binding than does SHBG, albumin binds half or more of plasma testosterone because of its high concentration. Since nearly all of the albumin-bound testosterone is available for tissue uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], bioavailable testosterone in plasma approximates the <strong>sum</strong> of free plus albumin-bound hormone.</p><p>The concentration of SHBG in men is approximately one-third to one-half that in women, and prepubertal boys and hypogonadal men have higher SHBG levels than normal men. The serum SHBG concentration is decreased by androgen administration and by hypothyroidism and increased by estrogen administration and hyperthyroidism. Alterations in the SHBG concentration do not affect androgen physiology in the steady state in normal men because the hypothalamic-pituitary system responds to acute changes in concentrations of bioavailable testosterone by altering testosterone synthesis and reestablishing a normal serum level of bioavailable testosterone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Androgen action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, the physiological actions of testosterone are the result of the combined effects of testosterone itself plus its active androgenic and estrogen metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The major functions of androgens in males include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulation of gonadotropin secretion by the hypothalamic-pituitary system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formation of the male phenotype during embryogenesis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal sexual development&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promotion of sexual maturation at puberty and its maintenance thereafter</p><p/><p>In addition, testosterone increases lean body mass and decreases fat mass. The reciprocal change in lean and fat mass is thought to be a result of promotion of development of mesenchymal stem cells into muscle rather than into adipocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Classical pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inside target cells, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone bind to the same high-affinity AR protein. Binding of the hormone to the receptor causes a conformational change that causes dissociation of the receptor from heat shock proteins such as hsp90. The hormone-receptor complex then forms a homodimer with a second hormone-AR receptor molecule.</p><p>The human AR cDNA predicts that the receptor has on average 917 amino acids and a mass of approximately 99 kD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61536\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61536 \">figure 5</a>). The AR is a member of the steroid-thyroid-retinoid superfamily of hormone receptors that act as transcription regulatory factors and have conserved C-terminal regions for hormone- and DNA-binding. The N-terminal and hinge regions of the AR bind the coactivator and corepressor proteins that combine with the AR-androgen complex to form the transcription regulatory complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The N-terminal region contains three homopolymeric repeat regions. The glutamine-repeat region averages 20 amino acids but is highly polymorphic in length; significant expansion (Kennedy syndrome or spinobulbar muscular atrophy) or shortening of the glutamine repeats impairs androgen action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of disorders of androgen action&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The active transcriptional regulatory complex binds with high affinity to androgen response elements (AREs) in DNA sequences. The AREs were originally thought to be located near the promoter region of genes, but it is now known that the AREs are linked by looping of the DNA to additional AREs to form complex binding sites for the transcriptional regulatory complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The net consequence is to either upregulate or downregulate the transcription of genes under androgen control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonclassical pathways</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;nonclassical&quot; androgen action refers to mechanisms that do not utilize the &quot;classical&quot; pathway described above, ie, they do not involve binding of the AR-transcription regulatory complex to AREs in DNA with effects on transcription hours to days later. These nonclassical actions are also sometimes referred to as &quot;nongenomic&quot; actions or &quot;rapid&quot; actions because they take place within seconds and may involve cell surface binding. The term &quot;nongenomic&quot; may be incorrect because some nonclassical androgen action pathways involve second messengers eventually leading to genomic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p>The nonclassical action pathway can be mediated by several mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classical intracellular AR via activation of a coregulator such as steroid receptor coactivator (Src) kinase not requiring gene transcription</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct binding to specific binding sites of target molecules in the absence of the AR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinct nonclassical cell surface transmembrane ARs or seven-transmembrane receptors that transmit signals via G-proteins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in membrane permeability</p><p/><p>Nonclassical androgen actions have been demonstrated in the reproductive, cardiovascular, immune, and musculoskeletal systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In Sertoli cells, for example, nonclassical androgen signaling pathways are responsible for the stimulation of calcium influx and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Testosterone in physiological concentrations, even when it is conjugated to bovine serum albumin as a membrane-impermeable analogue, binds to cell surface ARs and causes increased intracellular calcium in Sertoli cells by enhancing the influx of extracellular calcium influx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The increased intracellular calcium activates various kinases. In a second pathway, classical ARs in the plasma membrane can activate the MAPK pathway working through the epidermal growth factor receptor. Nonclassical actions of testosterone in Sertoli cells likely work in tandem with the classical actions to promote spermatogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SPERMATOGENESIS AND ITS REGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each spermatogonium that undergoes differentiation after puberty gives rise to 16 primary spermatocytes, each of which then enters meiosis and gives rise to four spermatids and finally four spermatozoa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75640\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75640 \">figure 6</a>). Thus, the 3 million spermatogonia that begin the process each day give rise to approximately 200 million spermatozoa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Since approximately one-half of potential sperm die during this process, 100 million sperm are produced each day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

The nucleus relocates to an eccentric position at the head of the spermatid and is covered by an acrosomal cap. The cilial core of the sperm tail consists of nine outer fibers and two inner fibers surrounded in the middle section by mitochondria and in the terminal section only by a cell membrane.</p><p>Sperm motility is due to the sliding action of the fibers in the axial structure of the tail. The fibers (or microtubules) are attached to each other by arms that contain the protein dynein, an ATPase. Hydrolysis of ATP generated in adjacent mitochondria provides energy for motility.</p><p>Sperm formation takes approximately 70 days from the spermatocyte stage, and the transport of sperm through the epididymis to the ejaculatory ducts requires approximately 14 days. Some maturation of sperm occurs during passage through the epididymis, as evidenced by enhancement of motility, but the final maturation (or capacitation) of sperm may take place after ejaculation into the female urogenital tract.</p><p>Normal spermatogenesis requires the lower temperature of the scrotum compared to that in the abdomen. However, a slight increase in scrotal temperature of approximately 1&deg;C, as for example with the wearing of athletic scrotal supports, does not appear to impair sperm number or quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main hormones that control spermatogenesis are follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone. FSH receptors are present in Sertoli cells and spermatogonia, and androgen receptor (AR) is present in Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and peritubular myoid cells. FSH acts directly on the Sertoli cell to increase production of androgen-binding protein, transferrin, inhibin B, <em>CYP19</em>, and plasminogen activators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. FSH also enhances glucose transport and the conversion of glucose to lactate in Sertoli cells.</p><p>The production of testosterone in Leydig cells under the control of luteinizing hormone (LH) results in an intratesticular testosterone concentration approximately 100 times greater than that in the peripheral circulation. Sertoli cells contain AR, and a Sertoli cell-selective knockout of AR in mice causes spermatogenic arrests in meiosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Both LH and FSH play roles in normal spermatogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. For example, spermatogenesis does not occur spontaneously in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism of prepubertal onset. Spermatogenesis can be initiated in these men by the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which has potent LH effects, and an FSH preparation, such as human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of fertility in men with secondary hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In men who develop hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in adulthood, eg, because of a pituitary adenoma, spermatogenesis ceases but can be restored by administration of hCG alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In normal men in whom FSH is selectively suppressed by administration of testosterone and hCG, sperm production is approximately one-half of normal but can be increased to normal by administration of FSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. These data suggest that both LH and FSH are necessary for the initiation of spermatogenesis, that LH by itself is sufficient for reinitiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis in adulthood, but that FSH is also necessary for spermatogenesis to be quantitatively normal in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of fertility in men with secondary hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Intratesticular paracrine factors and regulation of spermatogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary function of the Sertoli cell barrier of tight junctions between the spermatogonia and primary spermatocyte is probably to maintain proper conditions for germ cell development in the tubules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69256\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69256 \">figure 1</a>). Some molecules such as glucose and testosterone penetrate the tubule readily, whereas large molecules and peptides are almost completely excluded. Peptide hormones secreted into the tubular lumen are retained there by the barrier and may not function as endocrine factors outside the testis. Because the Sertoli cell barrier prevents many regulatory factors from entering the seminiferous tubules to influence germ cell development directly, the testes must produce local <span class=\"nowrap\">autocrine/paracrine</span> regulatory substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Factors that influence spermatogenesis include neuropeptides, vasoactive peptides, growth factors, and immune-derived cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/29,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,60,61</a>]. The large number of testicular cell types, the bicompartmental organization of the testis, and the many factors known to be present have led to the belief that coordination of the two functions of the testis (steroid hormone synthesis and spermatogenesis) utilize communication strategies involving the unique anatomic features of the testis. However, most of the paracrine-autocrine effects are postulated on in vitro studies and may not apply to the intact organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTICULAR FUNCTION DURING DIFFERENT PHASES OF LIFE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distinct phases of male sexual life (fetal, neonatal, pubertal, and adult) can be defined in terms of the plasma testosterone level. In the fetal phase, testosterone production by the testes commences during the seventh week of gestation, and serum testosterone concentrations reach 300 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (10.4 to 13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> which are maintained through the second trimester then fall, so that at the time of birth serum testosterone is similar in males and females.</p><p>During the neonatal phase, serum testosterone rises in the male and remains elevated for three to six months, again falling to a low level by one year of age and remaining low until the pubertal phase when it rises and reaches adult levels by age 17 years (300 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> [10.4 to 34.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span>. The neonatal surge in testosterone secretion results from a rise in plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. Inhibin B levels also rise during the neonatal period and reach concentrations exceeding those in normal adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>During adulthood, sexual maturation of the male is complete, and sperm production is sufficient to allow reproduction to take place. The serum concentration of bioavailable testosterone remains constant until the fifth decade when it begins to decline at a rate of approximately 1.2 percent per year; however, total testosterone levels do not decline appreciably until later. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-older-men-with-low-testosterone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to older men with low testosterone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The physiologic events during these various phases differ, as do the pathologic consequences of derangements in testicular function. Male phenotypic sex differentiation takes place during the fetal phase of male sexual life (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal sexual development&quot;</a>). The role of the neonatal surge in testosterone production is not certain but may involve the imprinting of male gender identity. The roles of testosterone in male puberty and the evaluation of testicular function in adult men are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The testes contain two anatomical units: the spermatogenic tubules, composed of germ cells and Sertoli cells, and the interstitium, containing Leydig cells that produce androgens. The testes are stimulated by luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the gonadotroph cells of the pituitary, and they in turn are stimulated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus.</p><p>The hypothalamus communicates with the pituitary via a portal vascular system and by neural pathways. The medial basal region of the hypothalamus contains neurons that secrete GnRH in a pulsatile fashion, the so-called GnRH pulse generator. This elicits pulsatile secretion of LH and FSH by the gonadotroph cells of the anterior pituitary.</p><p>LH stimulates testosterone synthesis, and FSH and testosterone regulate spermatogenesis.</p><p>Testosterone can be converted to 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone, which mediates many of the differentiative, growth-promoting, and functional aspects of androgen action in males. Alternatively, testosterone can be aromatized to estradiol, which exerts effects that are independent of, opposite to, or synergistic to those of androgens.</p><p>Of the 50 mcg of estradiol formed daily in normal adult men, approximately 85 percent is synthesized in extraglandular tissues, and the remainder in the testes.</p><p>Gonadal steroids are transported in the plasma largely bound to albumin and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG, also called testosterone-binding globulin [TeBG]). In normal men, approximately 2 percent of plasma testosterone is free or unbound, 44 percent is bound to SHBG, and 54 percent is bound to albumin and other proteins.</p><p>As described above, the physiological actions of testosterone are the result of the combined effects of testosterone itself plus its active androgenic and estrogen metabolites. The major functions of androgens in males include (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Androgen action'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulation of gonadotropin secretion by the hypothalamic-pituitary system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formation of the male phenotype during embryogenesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promotion of sexual maturation at puberty and its maintenance thereafter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in lean body mass and decrease in fat mass</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3468766255\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge James Griffin, MD, and Jean Wilson, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/male-reproductive-physiology/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wong CH, Cheng CY.
