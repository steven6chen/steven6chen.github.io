Organ systems relying most on aerobic metabolism are preferentially affected and involvement of the nervous system is common. When skeletal muscle is affected, either alone or with central nervous system disease, the term mitochondrial myopathy is used.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of the mitochondrial myopathies are discussed in this topic review. Treatment is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial myopathies: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H204734780\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitochondria are the cellular organelles responsible for oxidative phosphorylation, which produces energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Mitochondrial diseases can be divided into the following categories based on the primary genetic defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55067 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory chain proteins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory chain ancillary proteins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitochondrial RNA translation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitochondrial inner membrane lipid milieu</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depletion of mitochondrial DNA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitochondrial dynamics</p><p/><p>Oxidative phosphorylation is accomplished by the respiratory chain located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The respiratory chain is composed of five intramembrane complexes and two mobile electron carriers, coenzyme Q10, and cytochrome c. Although the earliest descriptions of mitochondrial diseases in humans were due to mutations of the mitochondrial DNA, it is now known that both mitochondrial and nuclear genes contribute proteins to the oxidative phosphorylation pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-structure-function-and-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial structure, function, and genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the last few decades the number of mitochondrial diseases has greatly expanded. This is a result of the recognition that in order to function correctly, the proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway must be translated, imported into the mitochondria, and inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane. Mutations in genes that affect these processes can be termed &quot;indirect hits&quot; to the mitochondrial respiratory chain and are also referred to as defects in respiratory chain ancillary proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Defects in the translation of mitochondrial RNA can cause mitochondrial diseases that may result in defects of multiple oxidative phosphorylation defects.</p><p>The spectrum of mitochondrial diseases has expanded further to include defects of the phospholipid bilayer of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In addition, the dynamic nature of mitochondria is now recognized; mitochondria are constantly moving, fusing, and dividing, and defects in these functions comprise a new category of mitochondrial diseases. An adequate number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is required to maintain the key subunits of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes for energy production. Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes are secondary to defects in mtDNA maintenance caused by mutations in nuclear genes. The resulting organ dysfunction is likely due to insufficient energy production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Mitochondrial diseases can manifest with a wide range of clinical phenotypes which presents a significant diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Tissues with high energy requirements (ie, brain, heart, skeletal muscle) are preferentially affected. When skeletal muscle is affected, the term mitochondrial myopathy is used. The term mitochondrial encephalomyopathy applies to diseases affecting the brain and skeletal muscle.</p><p>This review will focus only on those mitochondrial diseases that manifest commonly or occasionally with muscle disease and will not cover all mitochondrial diseases. Muscle disease may be the predominant clinical feature or a minor feature in the context of a multisystem disease; the term mitochondrial myopathies will be used here to refer to both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although once considered rare, accumulating evidence suggests that mitochondrial disorders are relatively common.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based study reviewed all pediatric health records from western Sweden from 1984 until 1999 and found that the incidence of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies in preschool aged children was 1 in 11,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The point prevalence in children younger than age 16 years was 1 in 21,000. Due to the high childhood mortality of these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], the median survival for those with infantile onset was age 12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This explains the relatively lower point prevalence than expected for chronic diseases. The study used stringent inclusion criteria, and concluded that the results were minimum estimates of the true incidence and prevalence. All but one of the 32 children in the study had muscle involvement, suggesting that the incidence and prevalence of mitochondrial myopathies is only slightly less than that reported for mitochondrial encephalomyopathies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report from northeast England of adults with symptomatic mitochondrial disease, the estimated prevalence of pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations was 20 per 100,000 (1 in 5000) and the estimated prevalence of pathogenic nuclear DNA mutations was 2.9 per 100,000 (1 in 35,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Approximately 38 percent of adults with mitochondrial DNA mutations were affected by Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a condition that usually does not have a significant degree of myopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The same group from northeast England screened 3168 neonatal cord blood samples for 10 common mtDNA point mutations and found that the prevalence of mtDNA point mutations was greater than 1 in 200 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, some of these mutations will never be clinically expressed due to variable heteroplasmy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An Australian study estimated that the minimal birth prevalence of primary mitochondrial disorders was 6.2 cases per 100,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Spanish study estimated that the prevalence of mitochondrial disease in a population over 14 years of age was 5.7 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Electrophysiologic analysis detected signs of myopathy in 80 percent of patients examined and neuropathy in 22 percent.</p><p/><p>Despite different geographical areas and populations sampled, all four studies show grossly concordant results. Given the non-overlapping ages of disease onset between the northeast England study (after age four) and the Australian report (generally before age four), the Australian investigators extrapolated that the overall prevalence of oxidative phosphorylation defects is at least 13.1 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This estimate, if accurate, indicates that primary mitochondrial disorders are the most common inherited errors of metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>These data also suggest that, with the exception of patients with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, the vast majority of patients with mitochondrial disorders will display signs of myopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175969070\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical expression of mitochondrial myopathies is extremely variable. Myopathy may be the main presenting feature, or merely a minor feature. The severity of these disorders ranges from mild exercise intolerance to fatal infantile encephalomyopathy or multisystem disease.</p><p>The clinical phenotypes of mitochondrial myopathies can be divided as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated myopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) or Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encephalomyopathy of infancy and childhood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multisystem disease with myopathy</p><p/><p>A limitation of this classification system is that a certain degree of overlap exists between these phenotypic categories. For instance, patients affected by CPEO may develop mild proximal muscle weakness or exercise intolerance later in life. Alternatively, patients who initially have only exercise intolerance or a mild proximal myopathy may progress into external ophthalmoplegia.</p><p>Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS) refers to a group of conditions characterized by a significant decrease in mitochondrial DNA affecting multiple tissues, with manifestations involving muscle, liver, or both muscle and brain. MDS can be classified to several major types, including myopathic (mutations in TK2, RRM2B and AGK), encephalomyopathic (mutations in SUCLA2, SUCLG1, and RRM2B), hepatocerebral (mutations in GDUOK, MPV17, POLG and C10ORF2), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurogastrointestinal (TYMP mutations).</p><p>Like other metabolic disorders, mitochondrial myopathies may present during periods of increased physiologic stress, such as an illness or <span class=\"nowrap\">surgery/anesthesia</span>. In addition, they can be associated with prolonged recovery or episodes of rhabdomyolysis. </p><p>Limited evidence from small studies suggests that psychiatric symptoms have an increased prevalence in patients with mitochondrial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], although large case-controlled series are lacking. Psychiatric symptoms can be more difficult to treat in patients with mitochondrial disorders since many psychotropic medications can negatively impact mitochondrial function. As an example, valproic acid, which is used as a mood stabilizer, can inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain and should be avoided in mitochondrial disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175969086\"><span class=\"h2\">Isolated myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitochondrial disorders can occasionally present only with muscle symptoms. These include exercise intolerance, fatigue, muscle weakness, elevated serum creatine kinase (CK), myalgia, or, less often, rhabdomyolysis. The pattern of muscle involvement can be highly variable. Proximal limb muscles are more commonly involved but distal myopathies have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The genetic defects underlying isolated myopathies can be due to mitochondrial or nuclear mutations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated myopathies due to mitochondrial DNA mutations are rare and only a few reported cases are published in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Isolated myopathy may be the initial presentation of several of the multisystem mitochondrial diseases due to mitochondrial DNA mutations which will be discussed below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many defects of nuclear DNA can present with signs and symptoms of myopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55067 \">table 1</a>). These include defects of the respiratory chain, ancillary proteins, intergenomic signaling, and the lipid milieu of the inner mitochondrial membrane.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Coenzyme Q10 deficiency due to nuclear DNA mutations can present with proximal muscle weakness in isolation although other clinical manifestations include encephalomyopathy, cerebellar ataxia, nephrotic syndrome, and multisystem disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This disorder is important to recognize because it is potentially treatable with coenzyme Q10 replacement. (See <a href=\"#H2315982899\" class=\"local\">'Coenzyme Q10 deficiency'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-myopathies-treatment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial myopathies: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Coenzyme Q10'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A slowly progressive generalized myopathy has been reported uncommonly with DNA depletion secondary to TK2 gene mutations that predominantly involves axial and proximal muscles, but also affects respiratory, facial, and ocular muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, a rapidly progressive and predominantly myopathic presentation with DNA depletion secondary to TK2 mutations has been described in severe mitochondrial DNA depletion of infancy and childhood. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Severe encephalomyopathy of infancy or childhood'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185044553\"><span class=\"h2\">CPEO and Kearns-Sayre syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) typically develop a slowly progressive paresis of extraocular muscles along with bilateral ptosis in the fourth decade of life, although they can present at any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>]. Diplopia is often absent or only transient. Patients with CPEO often have a low degree of early disability, but detailed evaluation of vision will frequently uncover significant visual deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>The differential diagnosis of CPEO includes myasthenia gravis, ocular myositis, thyroid associated orbitopathy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, and congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>KSS refers to the combination of CPEO with pigmentary retinopathy and onset before age 20. Other abnormalities have been described, including short stature, cerebellar ataxia, raised cerebrospinal fluid protein (&gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> cardiac conduction defects, anemia, diabetes, deafness, and cognitive deficits or mental retardation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. KSS is usually more severe than isolated CPEO, progressing to complete ophthalmoparesis, and often to death by the fourth decade due to the associated deficits. Patients with either disorder can develop a proximal myopathy.</p><p>Inheritance of CPEO and KSS can be sporadic, maternal, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive, reflecting that both defects of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA can cause identical phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. When the defect is due to a mitochondrial DNA defect, it is usually a result of large-scale mitochondrial DNA rearrangements, although point mutations are also rarely reported. </p><p>Autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of CPEO are linked to mutations in several nuclear DNA genes, including POLG, C10orf2, RRM2B, SLC25A4, POLG2, DGUOK, and SPG7, which cause defects in intergenomic signaling leading to multiple secondary mitochondrial DNA deletions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185044836\"><span class=\"h2\">Leber hereditary optic neuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a maternally inherited bilateral subacute optic neuropathy. LHON typically produces severe and permanent visual loss in young men. With the rare exceptions of two distinct mitochondrial DNA mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], LHON is usually not associated with myopathy but some patients present with movement disorders or cardiac conduction defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Other presentations included a hepato-intestinal form in 25 percent, a cardiac form manifesting mainly as early fatal cardiomyopathy in 16 percent, and Barth syndrome (X-linked cardiomyopathy, mitochondrial myopathy, and cyclic neutropenia) in 6 percent. Prognosis was poor. Overall, 13 patients died in the neonatal period, another 15 died later, two were lost to follow-up, and two survived.</p><p>In its most flagrant form, severe encephalomyopathy of infancy or childhood presents at birth with marked hypotonia, respiratory muscle weakness requiring ventilatory support, and feeding difficulty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Affected infants usually die before reaching one year of age, leading to the term &quot;lethal infantile mitochondrial disease&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. They may have associated brain, heart, liver or kidney involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. The cause is usually a mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome secondary to mutations in the thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) or succinyl-CoA synthetase ligase 2 (SUCLA2) genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,43</a>]. Some children have associated severe renal failure resulting from generalized proximal tubular dysfunction (ie, the Fanconi syndrome) and have a deficiency in complex III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Coenzyme Q10 deficiency can also cause a rapidly fatal encephalomyopathy of infancy with nephrotic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Muscle biopsy is suggested when DNA testing cannot confirm the diagnosis. Muscle biopsy is most useful to confirm the diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathies when they are caused by a primary mitochondrial DNA defect since ragged red fibers (see <a href=\"#H204735706\" class=\"local\">'Histochemical studies'</a> below) are likely to be seen on the muscle histology. A mitochondrial DNA defect is not always the only suspected diagnosis at the time of biopsy and in this case the muscle biopsy is useful to rule out other causes of myopathy (for example, the immune-mediated myopathies). This is especially important in cases where muscle disease is the only symptom and the multisystem features of mitochondrial disease are not present. Muscle biopsy can be diagnostic for mitochondrial disease even in cases where there is no evidence of myopathy from the history, physical examination, serum CK level, or EMG.</p><p>The consensus-based expert guidelines recommend open muscle biopsy over percutaneous biopsy techniques except in special circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. In addition, they suggest the vastus lateralis muscle since many laboratories have established reference ranges using this muscle.</p><p>The main limitation of muscle biopsy in the diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathies is that it may be normal or show only minimal abnormalities for certain mitochondrial defects. </p><p>Due to the invasive nature of the muscle biopsy, which carries risks of pain, bleeding, infection, nerve damage, and sampling error, genetic testing on peripheral blood is preferable in cases where the mutation is expressed in hematopoietic cells. As an example, MELAS due to mitochondrial DNA mutation m.3243A&gt;G can be confirmed on DNA extracted from leukocytes in peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

These findings are due to compensatory proliferation of mitochondria in response to energy failure, some of them normal and others diseased. On Gomori trichrome stains, the mitochondria appear as bright red masses against the blue background of the myofibers, which led to the term &quot;ragged red fibers&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62466\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62466 \">picture 1</a>). Mitochondrial proliferation is not always an indicator of a mitochondrial defect and can be seen in secondary mitochondrial dysfunction, other forms of myopathy (eg, inclusion body myositis), hypotonia, and due to regular, intense exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>On SDH-reacted sections, muscle fibers with subsarcolemmal mitochondrial proliferation have been termed &quot;ragged blue fibers.&quot; In addition, certain disorders such as MELAS will show &quot;strongly SDH-reactive blood vessels&quot; (SSVs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82373\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82373 \">picture 2</a>), which indicate mitochondrial proliferation in perivascular smooth muscles and endothelial cells.</p><p>COX activity in ragged blue fibers or ragged red fibers is variable. In general, COX-negative fibers are frequently seen in mitochondrial DNA defects (both due to mutations in the catalytic subunits and also due to defects of mitochondrial protein synthesis).</p><p>The COX activity in the ragged red or blue fibers can give clues to the genetic defect in the following two scenarios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mosaic pattern of normal fibers mixed with ragged <span class=\"nowrap\">blue/red</span> but <strong>COX-negative</strong> muscle fibers is most suggestive of mitochondrial DNA defects, usually affecting mitochondrial protein synthesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F82373\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82373 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mosaic pattern of normal fibers mixed with ragged <span class=\"nowrap\">red/blue</span> <strong>COX-positive</strong> fibers suggests a mitochondrial DNA defect in genes sparing the three COX subunits (COX I, II or III) in complex IV.
