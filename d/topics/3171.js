Immediate hemodialysis access should be straightforward, available for immediate use, and have minimal complications in the short term (days to weeks). A large-bore double-lumen nontunneled catheter is most often used when an immediate need for hemodialysis arises (eg, acute kidney injury, thrombosed hemodialysis access, poisoning). If dialysis for more than one week or so is likely, a cuffed, tunneled catheter should be used instead. Cuffed, tunneled catheters can also be placed for patients with chronic kidney disease who require dialysis but do not have a functional permanent vascular access. Ideally, when permanent dialysis access is required, an arteriovenous hemodialysis fistula is created or a prosthetic arteriovenous graft is placed. Once the fistula or graft can be used reliably, the catheter is removed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maturation-and-evaluation-of-the-newly-created-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maturation and evaluation of the newly created hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The basic aspects of dialysis access catheters and their complications will be reviewed here. An overview of central venous access and placement of catheters at specific sites is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79680952\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYSIS CATHETERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The broad categories of catheters available for hemodialysis vascular access include nontunneled and tunneled catheters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F95494\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95494 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H3103752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Central catheters and devices'</a>.)</p><p>The basic principles governing the use of catheters for hemodialysis and the general features of nontunneled and tunneled catheters are discussed below. There are many types of hemodialysis catheters, but few trials are available systematically comparing the various catheters to assess the performance of different materials and catheter shapes on delivered dialyzer blood flow rates and rates of infection or thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>A multidisciplinary panel of experts formed a workgroup to develop a document proposing standardized definitions for central venous catheters endpoints (catheter-related bloodstream infections, catheter dysfunction, and central vein obstruction) to help guide future product development and clinical trials on dialysis catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79682271\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialysis catheters usually have at least two lumens attached to two ports (blue and red colored). By convention, the red port identifies the &quot;arterial&quot; lumen that draws blood from the body <span class=\"nowrap\">(proximal/side</span> opening[s]) and the blue port identifies the &quot;venous&quot; lumen for return of blood from the dialysis machine to the patient (the distal opening[s]). This direction of flow may occasionally be reversed by dialysis nurses if blood flow is limited in this conventional direction. The continuous blood path made possible by the dual lumen design allows rapid blood flows and a hemodialysis technique that does not require heparin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-anticoagulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis anticoagulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Triple-lumen, nontunneled dialysis catheters are also available to facilitate blood drawing and possibly diminish the need for additional central venous catheters and peripheral intravenous devices. The third port is located between the red and blue ports and is available to draw blood and administer intravenous fluid or drugs. In a multicenter, prospective study of nontunneled triple-lumen hemodialysis catheters, blood flow rates and infectious complications were similar for triple-lumen catheters compared with dual-lumen hemodialysis catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Some speculate that triple-lumen catheters may spare the veins needed for future permanent access, but there are no hard data to substantiate this assertion.</p><p>Compared with a typical catheter used for central venous access, the lumen of a dialysis catheter has a larger diameter to provide a high rate of flow. The flow rate that a catheter is capable of delivering is determined by Poiseuille's Law, which states that resistance to flow in a tube is proportional to the length of the tube and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius. Higher viscosity (increasing hematocrit) also increases resistance. At the same negative prepump pressure, blood flows are consistently higher with right-sided internal jugular vein catheters compared with left-sided catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], due, in part, to additional resistance to flow from the two necessary bends and longer length of the catheter for left-sided access.</p><p>The actual blood flow rate provided by the hemodialysis circuit (hemodialysis catheter plus tubing) is almost always lower than the rate displayed on the dialysis pump due to negative inflow pressures from tubing deformation within the roller pump segment. In our experience, we have found that catheter flows may be 20 to 30 percent lower than what is recorded by the pump when negative inflow pressure exceeds 200 mmHg. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Nontunneled catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nontunneled hemodialysis catheters are designed for short-term use and are the preferred catheter for immediate hemodialysis vascular access. These catheters should not be used routinely in the home or outpatient setting. Many different nontunneled catheters are available and are composed of materials such as polyurethane, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, and medical-grade silicone. The outer shaft diameter ranges from 8 to 13.5 French (Fr) and provides pump flow rates of 300 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span>. For the same negative inflow pressure, lower hemoglobin (hematocrit) levels produce higher blood flows. (See <a href=\"#H79682271\" class=\"local\">'Basic principles'</a> above.) </p><p>These catheters are relatively straightforward to insert. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H3104780\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'General technique'</a>.)</p><p>Most nontunneled dialysis catheters have a conically pointed tip and are relatively rigid at room temperature to facilitate insertion, but the catheter generally softens at body temperature to minimize the potential for vessel trauma. Because the more rigid material used in nontunneled catheters can perforate through the great veins or heart, verification of correct catheter tip positioning is essential. Nontunneled catheters are supplied in a number of shaft sizes (8 to 13.5 Fr), configurations (straight or curved), and lengths (9 to 30 cm). The selection of the appropriate catheter type is at the sole discretion of the practitioner placing the catheter. To determine the appropriate length, the practitioner should take into account the height of the patient and the location from where the catheter is being inserted. Catheters inserted from the left side may need to be longer as they have a further distance to traverse. The operator should take into account the need, requirements, and duration for the catheter, as well as site location. Ultrasound guidance should be used during the insertion. At a minimum, fluoroscopy or a chest film should be obtained immediately following insertion of the catheter, but prior to its use, to verify the catheter tip position and identify other immediate complications, such as a pneumothorax or air embolism<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H79682089\" class=\"local\">'Catheter positioning'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H1232392311\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Confirmation of catheter tip positioning'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79683463\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use-life of nontunneled catheters varies with insertion site. Mechanical malfunction and infectious complications are the principle reasons for removing a nontunneled dialysis catheter. It is our practice and recommendation that nontunneled catheters be used for hemodialysis of less than one-week duration even for acute kidney injury because of the increased risk for infection when compared with tunneled hemodialysis catheters. The recovery from acute kidney injury with the need for hemodialysis is very difficult to predict. Only a minority of the patients recover renal function in less than one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Therefore, unless the patient is too unstable for transport to the procedure room or other contraindications to insertion exist, we place a tunneled catheter.</p><p>Nevertheless, longer periods have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Femoral catheters are generally limited to a single dialysis session in ambulatory hospitalized patients, and three to seven days in bed-bound patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Femoral catheters in ambulatory patients are removed after each dialysis session because of the issues of safety and difficulty maintaining the catheters, which are prone to malposition and kinking. </p><p>After two weeks, the rate of infection rises in both the femoral and internal jugular positions. In a study of 318 new hemodialysis catheter insertions, the risk of bacteremia with internal jugular vein and femoral vein hemodialysis catheters was examined during the first four weekly intervals after placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. During weekly intervals, which consisted of the time of placement to the end of weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4, the incidences of bacteremia for a femoral vein catheter were 3, 11, 18 and 29 percent, respectively, and for the internal jugular site were 2, 5, 5, and 10 percent. Lower rates of catheter-related bacteremia have been reported with the use of various exit-site protocols and locking solutions. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Catheter infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Following catheter removal, firm pressure should be applied for at least one to two minutes or longer until bleeding ceases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Tunneled catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tunneled catheters are primarily used for intermediate- or long-term hemodialysis vascular access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although chronic hemodialysis using an arteriovenous (AV) access is preferred, some patients are poor candidates for AV access creation and will require a hemodialysis catheter long-term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For critically ill patients, other comorbidities and confounding factors need to be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Placement of a tunneled catheter, rather than a nontunneled catheter, is advised for patients with acute kidney injury until it is known for certain that dialysis is likely to be permanent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In general, patients should not leave the hospital with a nontunneled catheter. </p><p>Tunneled dialysis catheters are associated with lower rates of infectious complications compared with nontunneled catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>]. Tunneled dialysis catheters are generally double-lumen catheters with a polyester cuff. The catheter is generally placed such that the cuff is positioned subcutaneously 1 to 2 cm from the skin exit site. Tissue ingrowth into the cuff seals off the catheter tunnel and reduces the risk of infection. The catheters are composed of silicone and other soft flexible polymers, like thin polyurethane, which are less thrombogenic than the materials used in nontunneled catheters. These catheters are blunt, soft, and flexible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H362076169\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Tunneled'</a>.)</p><p>A wide variety of tunneled catheters are available from multiple manufacturers. Tunneled catheters, which are available in a larger size (15.5 or 16 Fr), also allow for greater blood flow rates (&gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/minute)</span> compared with nontunneled catheters (largest 13.5 Fr).<strong> </strong>Catheters are available in a variety of configurations and tip designs, including double D, coaxial, shotgun, step tip, symmetric, and split-tip, among others. The differing designs aim to increase blood flow, minimize recirculation, and prevent catheter tip obstruction. Separation of the tips of the catheter can be achieved with a staggered tip design, use of a septum extruding beyond the openings, or splitting the catheter lumens distally. Some catheters are self-centering with a built-in curvature designed to push the tip of the catheter away from the wall of the vessel or heart chamber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Despite the wide variety of designs of tunneled hemodialysis catheters, each with its theoretical advantages and disadvantages, the few available randomized trials have failed to show the superiority of one catheter over another, particularly when the endpoint is long-term functional survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79683881\"><span class=\"h3\">Surface-coated catheters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial and antithrombogenic catheters appear to be effective in preventing intravascular catheter infections in the dialysis setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p>Some studies of antibiotic-bonded catheters have reported a decreased incidence of catheter-related infections in the short term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. As an example, 130 hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to a minocycline-rifampin coated catheter or a standard catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. At a mean catheter use period of eight days, infections were markedly reduced in the group that received the antibiotic-coated catheter (0 versus 7). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Central catheters'</a>.)</p><p>Heparin-coated catheters have also been produced in an attempt to decrease the incidence of catheter-related thrombosis. These devices have not been successful for preventing hemodialysis catheter thrombosis. In two retrospective studies, the frequency of catheter malfunction and overall catheter survival was similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective, case-control study was performed involving 88 tunneled dialysis catheters that were inserted over a 13-month period via the internal jugular vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thirty-eight were uncoated split-tip catheters and 50 were heparin-coated catheters. Primary patency of heparin-coated catheters was 92 percent at 30 days and 82 percent at 90 days, which was not significantly different from the primary patency of the uncoated catheters, which was 86 percent at 30 days and 76 percent at 90 days. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another retrospective study, the outcomes of 175 tunneled dialysis catheters placed in the internal jugular vein, including 89 heparin-coated catheters and 86 noncoated catheters, were evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The primary outcome was cumulative catheter survival, and the secondary outcome was infection-free catheter survival. The frequency of thrombolytic instillation was 1.8 per 1000 catheter-days for both groups. However, catheter-related bacteremia occurred significantly less frequently with heparin-coated catheters compared with noncoated catheters (34 versus 60 percent).</p><p/><p>It is important to remember that hemodialysis catheters are often required to remain in the patient for several months, which is a critical factor when determining the efficacy of a coating. Randomized trials are needed to demonstrate the longevity of the coating protection, which ideally should approximate the length of the intended catheter placement. Also, it is important to establish whether this effect remains in place in settings where infection preventive care is established and adhered to [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. In the absence of good data demonstrating long-term efficacy, the additional cost for these catheters may not be justified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1037144934\"><span class=\"h3\">Catheter life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall survival of tunneled hemodialysis catheters is highly variable. Unassisted one-year use-life (ie, no interventions) of tunneled hemodialysis catheters appears to be as low as 9 percent, but reports are not consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Assisted one-year use rates range between 25 to 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>]. One study found a 74 percent one-year and a 43 percent two-year catheter survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A larger study of 623 Tesio catheters reported the one-year and three-year postplacement use-life of 78 and 44 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In another study, assisted one-year patency was 50 percent when the catheter was used as a permanent access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Almost all catheter losses were due to bacteremia.

An overview of central venous access and the principles of ultrasound-guided access is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Local anesthesia and ultrasound guidance should be used for nontunneled dialysis catheters and can be placed at the bedside or in a procedure room. Confirmation of the catheter tip position must be documented using fluoroscopy or chest film prior to use of the catheter. Tunneled catheters are almost exclusively placed with ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance with local anesthesia, with or without sedation, in an angiographic suite or appropriately equipped operating room due to their larger caliber and the need to tailor the catheter for proper positioning. Catheter malposition is a common problem (25 to 40 percent) when fluoroscopy is not used for guidance; accurate catheter positioning can be achieved in 95 to 100 percent of cases with fluoroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Fluoroscopy also allows direct imaging of the wires and dilators to minimize the potential for injury. (See <a href=\"#H79681689\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis catheter complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79681682\"><span class=\"h2\">Access site considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any central venous catheter, dialysis catheters can be inserted into any of the central veins, such as the internal jugular vein, the femoral vein, or the subclavian vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Associated large peripheral veins, such as the external jugular vein, can also be used. The choice of the vascular access site and catheter should be guided by the urgency of dialysis, type of dialysis, history of prior access, and the overall medical condition of the patient. </p><p>The right internal jugular vein is the preferred vein for hemodialysis access (nontunneled and tunneled) because the vein takes a straight path directly into the superior vena cava. Placement of catheters into the left internal jugular vein requires that the catheter make two right angles prior to reaching the superior vena cava (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74801 \">figure 2</a>), which can cause difficulties during insertion and has a higher incidence of catheter dysfunction, particularly with nontunneled catheters. In a retrospective review of 532 catheters, left-sided internal jugular vein catheters had higher rates of infection (0.50 versus 0.27) and dysfunction (0.25 versus 0.11) compared with those inserted from the right [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H79683300\" class=\"local\">'Catheter malfunction'</a> below.) </p><p>Although hemodialysis catheters are most commonly placed into the internal jugular vein, the external jugular can also be used for tunneled catheters (with caution for nontunneled catheters using fluoroscopic guidance). The external jugular vein usually enters into the subclavian vein at a right angle that is not easily negotiated by the stiffer short-term hemodialysis catheters, and perforation of the subclavian vein can occur.</p><p>The subclavian vein, although not a preferred site, can also be used for tunneled catheters if the jugular veins are occluded and the common femoral vein is not a good option. However, this site has a high incidence (15 to 50 percent) of subclavian vein stenosis and subclavian vein thrombosis, and in general, subclavian vein insertion sites should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Subclavian <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/thrombosis</span> also compromises the placement of permanent ipsilateral upper extremity arteriovenous hemodialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Central vein stenosis/thrombosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Common femoral vein hemodialysis catheter insertion may be needed, particularly in the setting of bilateral occlusion of the central thoracic veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Venous access at the common femoral vein avoids many of the complications associated with thoracic central venous access (eg, pneumothorax, air embolism) and may be more appropriate in patients with certain medical comorbidities. As an example, femoral venous access may be better with fewer complications in acutely ill patients requiring positive-pressure ventilation. </p><p>A longer catheter is needed when hemodialysis access is placed into the common femoral vein. Short hemodialysis catheters (&lt;15 cm) have higher recirculation rates when the tip of the catheter is positioned in the iliac vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. A catheter length &gt;20 cm (tip to hub) is adequate for most average-sized adults to position the tip of the catheter in the inferior vena cava, which minimizes recirculation. Very long catheters (&gt;35 cm) should generally be avoided, as flow rate decreases with increasing catheter length, but may be needed in the rare circumstance in which an ileocaval stenosis prevented adequate dialysis with a shorter catheter.</p><p>In the presence of occlusion of the above-mentioned veins, percutaneous translumbar insertion of the catheter into the inferior vena cava is an option of last resort that can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

In general, tunneling the catheter follows venous puncture and guidewire placement. Because of the large diameter of hemodialysis catheters, a valved introducer peel-away sheath is needed to deliver the catheter into the vessel after dilation of the overlying soft tissues. The dilators and sheaths are stiff and should be imaged during their placement using fluoroscopy to ensure that the tip of the dilator is not taking an aberrant path, deforming the wire, or pushing through the vessel.

However, this effect may depend upon whether the catheter is right- or left-sided. In a retrospective review of 532 internal jugular hemodialysis catheters, left-sided catheters terminating in the superior vena cava or pericavoatrial junction had significantly more episodes of catheter dysfunction or infection compared with left-sided catheters terminating in the mid- to deep right atrium (0.84 versus 0.35), whereas no significant difference was identified for right-sided catheters based on tip position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The excess leakage volume has been measured to be up to 1.43 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109</a>]. Studies have shown that the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) increases after instillation of the heparin lock volume specified by the manufacturer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/110,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,111</a>]. The fill volume of each tunneled catheter lumen is found on each port, imprinted on the side of the catheter or clamp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. At a lower heparin concentration (1:100 or 1:1000), each lumen of the catheter is filled with the amount specified by the manufacturer on the port plus an additional 0.1 to 0.2 cc. Sodium citrate 4% can also be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/56,93,113\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,93,113</a>]. Typical volumes are 1.2 to 1.8 mL for short nontunneled catheters and 1.9 to 3.1 mL for larger tunneled catheters. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 36 patients were evaluated: seven dialyzed through arteriovenous fistulas, 29 through indwelling venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. To assess the heparin lock, either a full-dose heparin (5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL)</span> lock, a much weaker heparin lock (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL),</span> or a citrate lock were used. Clotting parameters from the patient group with arteriovenous fistulas (activated partial thromboplastic time [aPTT], anti-factor Xa) were normal following dialysis. Patients with indwelling venous catheters and heparin locks had significantly deranged clotting; 6 out of 10 patients had abnormal aPTT results. All patients with catheters, including those with heparin-free dialysis, and heparin locks had deranged clotting (seven out of seven). The rate decreased significantly when heparinized saline was used as a lock. A subset of patients had a citrate lock rather than a heparin lock; the clotting results normalized in all but one patient. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study designed to compare leakage for different brands of double-lumen dialysis catheters, five different double-lumen dialysis catheters were tested using three different lock volumes: the stated lock volume and both 20 percent over and under that volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. All of the catheters tested were conically shaped and had side holes. All had a substantial amount of leakage. When the catheter stated lock volume was used, all catheters leaked volumes that ranged from 18 to 30 percent of the injected volume, depending upon the size and manufacturer of the catheter. The leak ratio increases significantly with 20 percent overfill. There was some leakage even when using 20 percent less than the lock volume. </p><p/><p>Earlier in vitro work using a long-term tunneled catheter without side holes showed that instillation of the catheter filling volume results in an overspill of 17 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].</p><p>The phenomenon that results in this anomaly of leakage is shear stress as it relates to laminar flow in the catheter lumen. The stated fill volume for a catheter is measured under static conditions and incorrectly assumes that the advancing wave of introduced fluid moves as a vertical wall. Instead, the dynamics of shear stress dictate that there is a significant difference in velocity between the center of the column of advancing fluid and the boundary layer in contact with the wall where it is zero. Thus, the introduced fluid (heparin in this instance) moves down the catheter with a hyperbolic advancing edge. This results in leakage, although less than the amount of the lock volume.</p><p>In addition, the locking solution may spill into the blood stream under the influence of gravity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. As a result of the fluid dynamics that are occurring, the concentration of the locking solution at the catheter tip is much reduced. This is affected appreciably by the catheter's side holes. Much of the locking solution beyond the most proximal side hole is lost. It has been estimated that the mean concentration at the catheter tip is reduced to approximately 90 percent. It appears that slow administration of the locking solution has negligible influence upon the dynamics of the loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. However, in vitro experimental studies have shown that a small air bubble trapped in the Luer connection during connection reduces the spillage volume to 10 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].</p><p>Insufficient aspiration of heparin locked into the catheter, inaccuracy of the internal volume indicated on the catheter, human error, and &quot;leaching&quot; of heparin into the patient during the intradialytic period have also been noted as possible reasons for hemorrhagic complications after heparin locking of a dialysis catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175101784\"><span class=\"h3\">Catheter locking procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately following dialysis, proper flushing and the instillation of an anticoagulant into each lumen (ie, locking the catheter) decreases, but does not eliminate, the risk of hemodialysis catheter thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/56,61,119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,61,119,120</a>]. The usual rinse back with saline done at the end of dialysis is important to clear blood from the blood lines and dialyzer, but it is actually not very efficient in completely clearing all blood from the catheter or dislodging any small thrombi that might be present. Although commonly used after flushing the catheter, the evidence basis for locking a hemodialysis catheter with heparin, or an alternative anticoagulant, is weak. In the authors' opinion, properly flushing the catheter with normal saline is probably the more crucial factor for preventing catheter malfunction related to intraluminal thrombosis. However, data supporting the best flushing technique, volumes, and regimens are lacking. Clinical studies with a strong methodological design and with a focus on flushing and locking in relation to catheter malfunction are needed; in these, uniform malfunction definitions, terminology, and measurements should be used.</p><p>Prior to flushing the catheter, the following will need to be determined: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of locking solution (eg, heparin, citrate, saline) to be used (see <a href=\"#H241046287\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial'</a> above and <a href=\"#H241046175\" class=\"local\">'Catheter locking'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The concentration of locking solution </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The volume of locking solution (see <a href=\"#H241045901\" class=\"local\">'Locking solution volume'</a> above)</p><p/><p>Once the type, concentration, and appropriate volume of locking solution have been determined, we use the following steps to properly flush and lock each catheter lumen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepare two 10-cc syringes with saline, and two separate syringes with the appropriate concentration and volume of the chosen locking solution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disconnect the blood line from one side of the catheter. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Connect a 10-cc syringe filled with saline and immediately forcibly flush the catheter to remove any residual blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clamp the catheter prior to removing the saline syringe to prevent blood from entering at the tip while the hub of the catheter is open.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attach the syringe with the locking solution, unclamp the catheter, and instill the appropriate volume of locking solution. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close the clamp on the catheter and remove the syringe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fill the hub and its cap with locking solution and place onto the end of the catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57461029\"><span class=\"h2\">No role for systemic anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available data from randomized trials and observational studies do <strong>not</strong> support routine systemic antithrombotic prophylaxis for hemodialysis catheters to prevent catheter dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/58,121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,121,122</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review that included five trials evaluating the effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> anticoagulation on catheter dysfunction found no overall benefit compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

The number and severity of the complications increase with multiple catheter implantations and a longer catheter dwelling time. Ultrasound-guided puncture of the vein and fluoroscopic guidance of the wires and the catheter reduce complication rates and increase technical success.

Access-related complications for hemodialysis catheter placement are similar to those seen with the placement of other nontunneled and tunneled central catheters. However, because of the larger bore of hemodialysis catheters, the severity of the complications may be worse. General complications of central venous access are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-central-venous-catheters-and-their-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of central venous catheters and their prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For hemodialysis catheters, access-related complication rates are lowest for the femoral position, and complications, when they occur at this site, tend to be minor. The main complication associated with hemodialysis access is inadvertent needle puncture of the associated artery (eg, common femoral artery, subclavian artery, carotid artery). Bleeding usually resolves within 10 to 15 minutes with direct digital compression, which is easily performed at the femoral and jugular sites. However, unrecognized arterial laceration can lead to massive bleeding into the thigh, retroperitoneum, or chest depending upon the access site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. Inadvertent hemodialysis catheter placement into an artery should prompt consultation with a vascular surgeon. Removal of the catheter should <strong>not</strong> be attempted in the absence of surgical consultation. Although rare, hemodialysis catheter insertion can also result in atrial perforation (internal jugular, subclavian insertion) or major venous laceration (superior vena cava with internal jugular or subclavian; iliac vein or inferior vena cava with femoral insertion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/132-137\" class=\"abstract_t\">132-137</a>].

The internal jugular approach is associated with a lower risk of pneumothorax compared with a subclavian approach. The rate of pneumothorax for hemodialysis catheter placement ranges from 0 to 6 percent but has been reported to be as high as 12.4 percent for less experienced practitioners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/34,48,51,52,128,129\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,48,51,52,128,129</a>]. An initial failed vein cannulation is also associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax.

Small air emboli probably occur more often than recognized. Various maneuvers during insertion can be used to minimize the risk, such as crimping the introducer sheath before catheter insertion, asking the patient to hum to avoid large inspiratory efforts during insertion, or using a valved sheath. Air embolism can also occur with catheter removal. Hemodialysis catheters should be removed with the patient supine or in slight Trendelenburg position, and the entry site covered with an occlusive dressing. If air embolism has occurred, the patient should be placed in the left lateral decubitus position with 100 percent oxygen administered. The proper positioning and techniques for insertion and removal of central catheters, and the treatment of air embolism, are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Using this criterion, 87 percent of tunneled catheters will have dysfunction at least once during their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

An alternative measure of catheter dysfunction is catheter reliability, defined as the proportion of dialysis treatments in which the catheter provided adequate blood flows. One study, for example, found that catheters provided blood flow &lt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> in 13 to 58 percent of dialysis treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. </p><p>A mechanical malfunction of a hemodialysis catheter is often suspected when blood cannot be withdrawn from the catheter or saline cannot be infused into it. Low flow rates and high pressures during dialysis may indicate an impending occlusion. The mechanism of the obstruction may be mechanical (kinking of the catheter, tight suture, catheter pushed against the vessel wall) or thrombotic (internal intraluminal thrombosis or external thrombosis, catheter-associated thrombus, or a fibrin sheath). Differentiating between a mechanical or thrombotic etiology cannot usually be made on clinical grounds. Radiograph imaging should be obtained to elicit the catheter dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombosis-associated-with-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-catheters#H159480287\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombosis associated with chronic hemodialysis vascular catheters&quot;, section on 'Late catheter failure'</a>.)</p><p>Nontunneled hemodialysis catheters may be more susceptible to mechanical complications compared with tunneled catheters. However, there are limited data discussing the removal of malfunctioning nontunneled catheters for reasons beyond infection. In two studies, the incidence of low flow in nontunneled hemodialysis catheters thought to be due to mechanical obstruction from malposition or kinking, or intracatheter obstruction by thrombus or fibrin sheath, ranged from 19 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>].

The use of thrombolytic therapy for catheter lysis as described for other central venous catheters is very useful for treating hemodialysis catheter thrombosis. As an example, 2 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> was placed into each port of 22 nonfunctional tunneled hemodialysis catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].

Progressive vein stenosis ultimately leads to venous thrombosis.

In addition, the rapid blood flows associated with hemodialysis create areas of turbulent flow beyond the tip of the catheter, which stimulates endothelial proliferation, potentially leading to venous stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. Stagnation of flow at the catheter insertion site can also occur if the diameter of the catheter is large relative to the diameter of the cannulated vessel.

The relatively straight course of jugular and femoral catheters, in part, explains their lower rates of stenosis and thrombosis. Because of the implication of catheter <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/thrombosis</span> for future permanent upper extremity arteriovenous fistula creation, we agree with the updated 2006 National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines that strongly recommend avoiding placement in the subclavian vein, unless no other site is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/147,148\" class=\"abstract_t\">147,148</a>].</p><p>Most central vein stenoses are initially asymptomatic, but the stenosis may manifest after the creation of a peripheral arteriovenous fistula in the ipsilateral extremity.

The high flow into the accessed vessel exceeds the rate at which blood can flow across the stenotic lesion, leading to venous congestion.

Catheter-associated bacteremia is associated with a 22 to 38 percent rate of metastatic infectious complications or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tunneled-cuffed-hemodialysis-catheter-related-bacteremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tunneled, cuffed hemodialysis catheter-related bacteremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bacteremia generally results from contamination of the catheter lumen or migration of bacteria from skin puncture site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/9,35,36,152,153\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,35,36,152,153</a>]. This migration usually limits the duration of use of nontunneled catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. Skin flora, <em>Staphylococcus</em> and <em>Streptococcus</em> species, are responsible for the majority of infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]. The risk of infection is significantly reduced with tunneled catheters, because the cuff, which is usually positioned just proximal to the catheter exit site, serves as a barrier to the migration of bacteria from the skin. </p><p>The rate of infection may vary with the site of catheter insertion. Some feel that the highest risk is with femoral catheters, followed by jugular and then subclavian vein catheters. However, there is conflicting evidence concerning the risk of infection based upon the site of insertion. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 105 nontunneled hemodialysis catheters (79 subclavian and 26 jugular), a significantly higher risk of catheter-related bacteremia was associated with internal jugular access (hazard ratio 3.57) compared with subclavian venous access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of 318 new hemodialysis catheters, a significantly higher risk of bacteremia was seen after insertion into the femoral vein compared with internal jugular vein placement (relative risk 3.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, in a large trial in which 750 dialysis patients were randomly assigned to receive short-term jugular or femoral venous access, no significant differences in infection rates were found for jugular and femoral venous catheterization (2.3 versus 1.5 per 1000 infections per catheter-days, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. However, among obese patients (body mass index [BMI] &gt;28.4), the incidence of catheter colonization was significantly lower with jugular catheterization, but there was no difference in rates of clinical infection. In addition, hematomas were significantly more common with jugular catheterization (3.6 versus 1.1 percent). </p><p/><p>For nontunneled catheters, the development of exit-site infection or bacteremia requires prompt removal of the catheter and appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/13,38,156\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,38,156</a>]. Exit-site infections associated with tunneled catheters may respond to antibiotics alone, and catheter removal may not be needed. The diagnosis and treatment of intravascular catheter-related infection are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9380285\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although autogenous arteriovenous access is ideal, in some situations, it is not an option. Prolonged use of hemodialysis catheters is justified when needed as a bridge device while awaiting arteriovenous access maturation or transplant, for patients who have exhausted other forms of access, and when the risk of complications of arteriovenous access is excessive. (See <a href=\"#H79682271\" class=\"local\">'Basic principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two main types of hemodialysis catheters: nontunneled or tunneled. Nontunneled catheters are shorter in length and are relatively stiff, which facilitates insertion. Tunneled dialysis catheters are made of soft polymer catheters and have one to two cuffs around the catheter to promote tissue ingrowth and adherence, and to minimize the risk of catheter infection by limiting migration of bacteria along the catheter from the exit site. Faster blood flow rates are achieved during dialysis for tunneled catheters because of their larger luminal diameter compared with nontunneled catheters. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Nontunneled catheters'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Tunneled catheters'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nontunneled hemodialysis catheters are preferred for immediate and acute hemodialysis. Due to the increased risk of infection over time, the duration of use for nontunneled catheters is limited, usually less than two weeks for internal jugular catheters. For femoral catheters, use is generally limited to a single treatment in ambulatory patients, but in bed-bound hospitalized patients the catheter may remain in place for three to seven days. It is our practice that if a temporary access is needed for dialysis, a cuffed catheter is preferable to a noncuffed catheter (even in the intensive care unit setting) if the catheter is expected to stay in place for more than two weeks. (See <a href=\"#H79683463\" class=\"local\">'Duration of use'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1037144934\" class=\"local\">'Catheter life'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis catheters are inserted using a modified Seldinger guidewire technique, typically into the jugular or femoral vein. We agree with the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines that suggest avoiding hemodialysis access in the subclavian vein, unless no other option is available. Subclavian access is associated with a high incidence of subclavian vein stenosis and thrombosis, which impairs the function of the catheter and compromises subsequent permanent arteriovenous dialysis access. (See <a href=\"#H79681682\" class=\"local\">'Access site considerations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Central vein stenosis/thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Access-related complications vary by site. The main access-related complication is inadvertent needle puncture of the associated artery (eg, common femoral artery, subclavian artery, carotid artery). The incidence of complications can reduced by using ultrasound guidance during vein cannulation, which is recommended for the jugular and femoral venous sites. Fluoroscopy should be used when placing tunneled catheters during guidewire insertion and dilator, sheath, and catheter manipulation. Inadvertent catheterization of the artery instead of vein with a large-bore hemodialysis catheter should prompt consultation with a vascular surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Insertion or immediate access-related'</a> above and <a href=\"#H79681696\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound guidance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H79682089\" class=\"local\">'Catheter positioning'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis catheter complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis of the lumen of the hemodialysis catheter frequently complicates its use. Thrombus formation may be limited by flushing each lumen of the catheter with normal saline, and possibly by instilling each catheter lumen with heparin or an alternative anticoagulant agent (eg, sodium citrate) after catheter placement and following each hemodialysis session. For the prevention of catheter malfunction, we suggest <strong>not</strong> routinely using prophylactic systemic anticoagulants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H241046175\" class=\"local\">'Catheter locking'</a> above and <a href=\"#H175101784\" class=\"local\">'Catheter locking procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H57461029\" class=\"local\">'No role for systemic anticoagulation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central vein <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/thrombosis</span> is a complication of all central venous catheters but may be more prominent with hemodialysis access due to stagnation of flow (larger diameter of the catheter relative to the cannulated vein), repeated catheterizations, and turbulent blood flow during dialysis. Central vein <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/thrombosis</span> is more common following subclavian compared with jugular venous hemodialysis access. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Central vein stenosis/thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious complications of hemodialysis catheters include local exit-site infection and systemic bacteremia. The risk of infection for tunneled catheters is significantly lower compared with nontunneled catheters. For nontunneled hemodialysis catheters, exit-site infection or bacteremia should prompt immediate removal of the catheter; however, for tunneled catheters, exit-site infections can often be treated locally with oral or intravenous antibiotics and local wound care. Prevention of infection involves adherence to proper placement technique and optimal catheter management. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Catheter infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H79681689\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above and <a href=\"#H241046287\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3884654457\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Steve J Schwab, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Oliver MJ, Edwards LJ, Treleaven DJ, et al.
