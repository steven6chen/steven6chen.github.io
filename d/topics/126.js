Approximately 2 percent is excreted in the urine unchanged.

Serum concentrations peak between one-half and two hours after an oral therapeutic dose, although the presence of food may slow this process. Peak serum concentrations are reached within four hours following overdose of immediate-release preparations but may be delayed when drugs that slow gastric emptying (eg, opiates, anticholinergic agents) are coingested or following overdose of extended release preparations. The biochemical pathways leading to toxicity are described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical factors that can predispose patients to injury from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> ingestion include chronic alcohol ingestion, medications that affect the CYP2E1 enzyme system of the liver, malnutrition, genetic polymorphisms, and older age. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical factors influencing toxicity'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike most other causes of hepatitis, acetaminophen-induced hepatitis is acute in onset, progresses rapidly, is characterized by marked elevation of plasma aminotransferases (often &gt;3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L),</span> and is associated with a rising prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/international</span> normalized ratio. Chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> poisoning in the alcohol user is also characterized by markedly elevated aminotransferases (&gt;3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L),</span> combined with hypovolemia, jaundice, coagulopathy, hypoglycemia, and acute renal failure in greater than 50 percent of these patients. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial manifestations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> poisoning are often mild and nonspecific, and do not reliably predict subsequent hepatotoxicity. Thus, measurement of the serum acetaminophen concentration is critical whenever overdose is suspected. The symptoms and signs of the four stages of acetaminophen overdose are described in the text. Severe overdose can result in liver failure. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of toxicity is best predicted by relating the time of ingestion to the serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> concentration. Therapeutic serum concentrations range from 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> (65 to 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. After a single acute overdose of an immediate-release preparation, a serum acetaminophen concentration should be drawn four hours after reported ingestion. If the ingestion was more than four hours prior to presentation, it should be drawn immediately. The level should be evaluated according to the modified Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine the need for NAC therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83590\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83590 \">figure 3</a>). Use of the nomogram in the setting of acute and chronic overdose of acetaminophen is described in the text.
