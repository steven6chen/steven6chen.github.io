Advances in management have decreased the incidence of pericarditis in patients with renal failure, but this problem is still associated with significant morbidity and occasional mortality. Two forms of pericarditis in renal failure have been described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Uremic pericarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uremic pericarditis results from inflammation of the visceral and parietal membranes of the pericardial sac. There is a correlation with the degree of azotemia (the blood urea nitrogen [BUN] is usually &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [22 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> although the pathogenesis is poorly understood. Except in the case of systemic immune disorders (such as lupus erythematosus or scleroderma), there is no relationship with the underlying cause of renal failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialysis-associated pericarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericarditis is occasionally observed in patients on maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At least two factors may contribute to this problem: inadequate dialysis (ie, the patient has uremic pericarditis) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that the two forms of uremic pericarditis in renal failure can be distinguished by the type (serous versus hemorrhagic) of effusion that is present, but there is significant overlap. Pathologic examination of the pericardium typically shows adhesions between the pericardial membranes, which are thicker than normal. Loculated bloody fluid, when present, is due in part to the frequent impairment in platelet function in renal failure and the use of anticoagulation during hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-dysfunction-in-uremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet dysfunction in uremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features of pericarditis in renal failure are similar to those observed with other causes. Most patients complain of fever and pleuritic chest pain, the intensity of which is quite variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pain is characteristically worse in the recumbent position. A pericardial rub is generally audible, but is frequently transient. Signs of cardiac tamponade may be seen, particularly in patients with rapid pericardial fluid accumulation. However, the high prevalence of autonomic impairment in this patient population may hinder the normally observed rise in heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Moreover, some patients with uremic pericarditis present without symptoms or suggestive findings (chest pain or pericardial rub) on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Cardiac ultrasonography reveals a pericardial effusion in at least 50 percent of cases.</p><p>In some individuals, uremic pericarditis may be associated with worsening anemia. This is a presumed reflection of the inflammatory state inducing resistance to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; however, volume overload with hemodilution may also be present.</p><p>There is one unusual feature of uremic pericarditis: the electrocardiogram (ECG) does not show the typical diffuse ST- and T-wave elevations observed with other causes of acute pericarditis. This results from the lack of penetration of the inflammatory cells into the myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Hypothyroidism is the other condition where pericarditis may be observed without ECG changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Thus, the finding of these ECG abnormalities suggests some other cause for the pericarditis, such as intercurrent infection. With the development of cardiac tamponade, typical ECG changes (eg, electrical alternans) may occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of otherwise unexplained pericarditis in a patient with advanced renal failure is an indication to institute dialysis (providing there is no circulatory compromise or evidence of impending tamponade). Most patients with uremic pericarditis respond rapidly to dialysis with resolution of chest pain as well as a decrease in the size of the pericardial effusion.</p><p>Either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis can be used, but each technique has certain disadvantages. Since anticoagulation can increase hemorrhage into the pericardial space, systemic anticoagulation should be avoided when hemodialysis is the chosen modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-anticoagulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis anticoagulation&quot;</a>.) In addition, acute fluid removal with hemodialysis can lead to cardiovascular collapse in patients with tamponade or pretamponade. Peritoneal dialysis, on the other hand, can compromise respiratory function due to intraperitoneal fluid accumulation. The form of dialytic therapy is usually determined by local availability and the long-term plans for the patient with chronic end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</p><p>Management is often more complicated in patients with dialysis-associated pericarditis. The intensity of dialysis is usually increased in hemodynamically stable patients with no or small- to medium-sized effusions. Increased dialysis usually leads to resolution of the pericarditis within one to two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The size of the pericardial effusion should be monitored throughout this period by serial cardiac ultrasonography. At times, a patient on hemodialysis may be switched to peritoneal dialysis to avoid heparinization, if heparin-free dialysis cannot be performed.</p><p>The uses of anti-inflammatory medications and systemic corticosteroids have been tried with limited success when intensive dialysis is ineffective. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Indomethacin</a> can reduce the fever, but does not accelerate resolution of the pericardial inflammation or effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. High-dose corticosteroids may be beneficial, but their systemic use is limited by their potential side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and by a potentially higher risk of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. By comparison, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> may reduce recurrences in patients with uremic pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Thus, drainage of a large effusion is the treatment of choice if it fails to improve in 7 to 14 days with intensified dialysis or if it increases in size. Drainage is imperative without a trial of intensive hemodialysis in patients presenting with a large effusion when there is evidence of diastolic collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The type of procedure utilized is determined by local experience and by the condition of the patient. Acute cardiac tamponade with circulatory collapse should be treated with pericardiocentesis, preferably under echocardiographic guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>While pericardiocentesis may not be recommended for effusions that do not produce circulatory compromise, the rapidity with which the effusion develops may affect this decision. Since the pericardial space may accommodate slowly developing effusions, pericardiocentesis may be recommended with only a moderate-sized effusion that develops rapidly, even without evidence of tamponade. The morbidity and potential mortality (due, for example, to right ventricular laceration) in this setting are not insignificant, but can be substantially reduced by echocardiographic guidance.</p><p>The surgical procedures for a large, nonresolving effusion are subxiphoid pericardiotomy (with or without the instillation of intrapericardial corticosteroids) or pericardiectomy. The indications for the selection of one approach over the other are not uniformly established. Subxiphoid pericardiotomy, which can be performed under local anesthesia, has the additional advantages of relatively few complications and a high success rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/4,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18</a>]. An intrapericardial catheter can also be placed for drainage and steroid instillation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> hexacetonide 50 mg every six hours for two to three days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Pericardiectomy, in contrast, is a definitive procedure that is only rarely associated with recurrent pericarditis or effusion. Nevertheless, there is potential morbidity associated with the procedure, which must be performed under general anesthesia and through a thoracotomy approach. As a result, it is usually recommended only in settings in which pericardiotomy cannot be performed or has been unsuccessful. An alternative to open thoracotomy is thoracoscopic pericardiectomy, which may successful in selected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In patients with acute renal failure-associated hemorrhagic pericarditis and tamponade, transient constrictive-like pericarditis may develop after pericardiocentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This finding usually resolves completely over time, although chronic constrictive pericarditis has been described in ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericarditis following renal transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericarditis has been reported in patients after renal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It usually develops within two months after transplant surgery; uremia is the most common cause, with cytomegalovirus and other infections being next in frequency. The diagnosis is usually suggested by the finding of a pericardial friction rub on physical examination; it can be confirmed by echocardiography. Pericardiocentesis may be required for diagnosis or treatment in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> has been associated with pericarditis, this typically occurs after heart, rather than renal, transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sirolimus</a> has been associated in rare circumstances with pericardial effusions among renal transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pericarditis-in-renal-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H639797\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may develop pericarditis and pericardial effusions and, less commonly, chronic constrictive pericarditis.
