When an insect stings you, it uses a special &quot;stinger&quot; on the back of its body.</p><p>Biting insects can transfer blood from other people and animals they've bitten to you. That means they can infect you with the diseases their other victims have. Mosquitoes and ticks, for example, can carry a few infections.</p><p>Stinging insects, such as bees, wasps, and fire ants, do not usually carry disease. But stinging insects can inject you with venom that can irritate your skin. Plus, insect stings can be deadly to people who are severely allergic to the insect venom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40567116\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if I am stung by a bee, wasp, or fire ant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are stung by a bee or wasp, quickly remove the stinger from your skin if it is still there. If you are stung by a fire ant, kill the ant with a slap as soon as you feel the sting.</p><p>Some people have a severe allergic reaction to insect stings called anaphylaxis. <strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if you suddenly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble breathing, become hoarse, or start wheezing (hearing a whistling sound when you breathe)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start to swell, especially around the face, eyelids, ears, mouth, hands, or feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Develop belly cramps, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel dizzy or pass out</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40567123\"><span class=\"h1\">What is a normal reaction to an insect sting?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insect stings can cause the area around the sting to swell, turn red, hurt, and feel hot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63900\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63900 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>To treat the pain and swelling around the area of the sting, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash the area with soap and cool water</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the area clean and try not to scratch it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a cold, damp washcloth on the area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take or apply anti-itch medicine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a nonprescription pain medicine for the pain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40567130\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I know about tick bites?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ticks are found in the grass and on shrubs, and can attach to people walking by. One type of tick can spread Lyme disease. But a tick has to stay attached for a while before it can give you the infection. If you are bitten by a tick, gently remove the tick from your skin, using tweezers. If you cannot remove a tick, see your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40567137\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to reduce the chances of getting bitten or stung?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear shoes, long-sleeved shirts, and long pants when you go outside. If you are worried about ticks, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light colors so you can spot any ticks that get on you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear bug spray.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay inside at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drain areas of standing water near your home, such as wading pools and buckets. Mosquitoes breed in standing water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep foods and drinks covered when you are outside.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you see a stinging insect, stay calm and slowly back away.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you live in an area that has fire ants, avoid stepping on ant mounds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you find an insect nest in or near your house, call a pest-control service to get rid of the nest safely.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40567144\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bee-and-insect-stings-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bee and insect stings (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imported-fire-ants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Imported fire ants (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=west-nile-virus-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: West Nile virus infection (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-do-after-a-tick-bite-to-prevent-lyme-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: What to do after a tick bite to prevent Lyme disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lyme disease prevention (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lyme disease symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
