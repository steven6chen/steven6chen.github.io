It can cause learning problems and medical problems affecting the heart, blood, digestive system, and other organs. The learning and medical problems in people with Down syndrome can be mild or severe.</p><p>People with Down syndrome have a problem with their chromosomes. Chromosomes are tiny parts of cells that carry the plans that make our bodies the way they are. People with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome. This causes their problems and makes them look a little different than people without Down syndrome.</p><p>About 1 in 700 babies is born with Down syndrome. A woman of any age can have a baby with Down syndrome. But a woman is more likely to have a baby with Down syndrome the older she gets. She's also more likely to have a baby with Down syndrome if she has a close family member with the condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665610405\"><span class=\"h1\">What is a screening test for Down syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A screening test for Down syndrome is a test that can tell you if it is likely that your baby has Down syndrome. Screening tests do <strong>not</strong> tell you for sure if your baby has Down syndrome. Having a screening test does not increase a woman's chance of having a miscarriage. A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the woman has been pregnant for 20 weeks.</p><p>If a screening test shows that there is a high chance that a baby has Down syndrome, a woman can have another test to find out for sure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665610412\"><span class=\"h1\">Which tests can tell for sure if my baby has Down syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tests that can do this are called &quot;diagnostic tests.&quot; Two types of diagnostic tests are available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chorionic villus sampling, also called &quot;CVS&quot; &ndash; During CVS, a doctor removes a tiny piece of the placenta. The placenta is the organ that brings the baby nutrients and oxygen and carries away waste. CVS can be done by putting a thin tube through the vagina and into the uterus, or by inserting a needle through the woman's belly. This test is usually done at 11 to 12 weeks of pregnancy, but it can be done as late as 14 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amniocentesis &ndash; During amniocentesis, a doctor puts a needle through the belly into the mother's uterus and removes some of the fluid that is around the baby. This test is usually done between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, but it can be done later.</p><p/><p>It is important to know that diagnostic tests can have side effects. Women who have diagnostic tests have a small chance of having a miscarriage because of the test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665610419\"><span class=\"h1\">Do all women have a screening test for Down syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. But all women get to choose if they want to have a screening test. Some women choose to have a screening test, and others choose not to. You can decide if a screening test is right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665610426\"><span class=\"h1\">Are different screening tests available?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Different screening tests are available depending on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How far along a woman is in her pregnancy &ndash; Different tests are done at different times during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where a woman lives &ndash; Different tests are available in different areas.</p><p/><p>Screening tests can involve:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests &ndash; Blood is taken from the mother.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound &ndash; This is an imaging test that creates pictures of the baby.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both blood tests and ultrasound</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665610433\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might a woman choose to have a screening test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A woman might have a screening test if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She wants to know as much as she can about her baby's health during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She is worried about her baby. She feels that she will worry less if there is a low chance that her baby has Down syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She wants to know if her baby has Down syndrome so that she can:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Learn about Down syndrome before the baby is born</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Give birth in a hospital that has experience taking care of babies with Down syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Choose whether to continue with the pregnancy or have an abortion</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665610440\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might a woman choose not to have a screening test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A woman might skip the test because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She feels that &quot;whatever will be, will be,&quot; and knows that she would never have an abortion. She will wait until her baby is born to see if it has Down syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She knows that she would not have a diagnostic test even if her screening test showed that there was a high chance her baby had Down syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She wants to know for sure if her baby has Down syndrome, so she will have a diagnostic test instead of a screening test.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665610447\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my screening test shows that there is a high chance my baby has Down syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your screening test shows that there is a high chance your baby has Down syndrome, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have another blood test, which can give you a better idea of how likely your baby is to have Down syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a diagnostic test to know for sure if your baby has Down syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not have any more tests done during pregnancy. You can wait until birth to have a test done to see if your baby has Down syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talk to an expert called a &quot;genetic counselor&quot; to help you make a choice</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665610454\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know which choice is right for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It can be tough to know which choice is right for you. To help you choose, talk with your doctor or nurse about the benefits and downsides of the different tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1665610461\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Down syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amniocentesis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Amniocentesis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chorionic villus sampling (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prenatal care (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=should-i-have-a-screening-test-for-down-syndrome-during-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Should I have a screening test for Down syndrome during pregnancy?
