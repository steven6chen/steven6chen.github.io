The current lifetime risk of prostate cancer for men living in the United States is estimated to be approximately one in six [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Rates of prostate cancer differ over 50-fold among various international populations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50243\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50243 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, interpretation of these data is complicated by dramatic changes in the incidence of prostate cancer in the United States and other Western countries that have taken place over the past several decades. These changes have been primarily driven by the increased frequency of prostate biopsies performed in asymptomatic men because of an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. In the United States, the incidence of prostate cancer dramatically rose in the early 1990s concomitant with the increasing utilization of PSA testing. After an initial peak, incidence rates fell, but they have persisted at a rate nearly twice that recorded in the pre-PSA era. A central argument against routine PSA screening is that many of these cancers, if left undetected, would never have become clinically meaningful during a man's lifetime. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ascertainment biases constitute an important, but incomplete, explanation for the observed international variations in prostate cancer incidence. Countries that do not utilize PSA testing typically have a much lower rate of prostate cancer compared with those that do. Unless studies control for the number of prostate biopsies performed, it is difficult if not impossible to be definitive in the conclusions.</p><p>Of the several known prostate cancer risk factors, the most important are age, ethnicity, genetic factors, and possibly dietary factors. The known risk factors for prostate cancer are reviewed here. Screening for prostate cancer and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This review will focus on the most common histologic type of prostate malignancy (adenocarcinoma) which comprises over 99 percent of the malignancies which affect this organ. Other histologies include small cell neuroendocrine tumors, sarcomas, and lymphomas, which are rarely encountered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of prostate biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate cancer has one of the strongest relationships between age and any human malignancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55572\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55572 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Clinically diagnosed prostate cancer rarely occurs before the age of 40, but the incidence rises rapidly thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, the annual incidence of new cases of prostate cancer in white men in 1995 was approximately 0.1, 0.6, and 1 percent in men in their 50s, 60s, and 70s, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although the incidence of new cases declines for men in their 80s, this almost certainly is attributable to the fact that fewer of these men have prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-driven biopsies.</p><p>The prevalence of malignancy based upon histologic examination of the prostate from men without clinical evidence of prostate cancer is much higher than the rate of clinically diagnosed disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although the reported prevalence rates for occult prostate cancer have varied substantially in different studies, the prevalence increased dramatically with age in all studies.</p><p>The widespread prevalence of occult prostate cancer in older men and the dramatic increase with age are illustrated by a review of autopsy studies conducted in multiple countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>20 to 30 years, 2 to 8 percent of men with occult cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>31 to 40 years, 9 to 31 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>41 to 50 years, 3 to 43 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>51 to 60 years, 5 to 46 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>61 to 70 years, 14 to 70 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>71 to 80 years, 31 to 83 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>81 to 90 years, 40 to 73 percent</p><p/><p>The variability between reports may reflect differences in pathologic techniques, or geographic differences due to environmental or ethnic factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETHNICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate cancer is more common in black than white or Hispanic men, perhaps related to a combination of dietary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62493\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62493 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/5,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7-9</a>]. The annualized average incidence rates for men in their early 70s per 100,000 population is approximately 1600, 1000, and 700 for African-Americans, whites, and Asian-Americans, respectively. Although incidence rates in Native Americans are even lower than in Asian-Americans, ascertainment biases prevent credible comparisons.</p><p>In addition to higher incidence rates, the age of onset in African-American men is earlier than for comparative groups. In a multi-institutional series of over 12,000 cases, 8.3 percent of blacks and 3.3 percent of whites were less than 50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Many studies have found that African-American men also have higher serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, worse Gleason scores, and more advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In the population-based Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study, the increased risk of advanced-stage disease persisted in African-American men, even after adjustment for socioeconomic, clinical, and pathologic variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One report found that African-American men diagnosed at an early stage still had a higher than expected rate of biochemical recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Poor health literacy has been implicated as a factor for advanced stage at presentation, irrespective of race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Also of interest, African-American men aged 60 and older (but not other age groups) with clinically localized prostate cancer received aggressive treatment significantly less often than either Caucasian or Hispanic men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Similar results have been noted by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The reasons for the differences in care received are not completely known but when stratified by pretreatment stage, grade, and PSA, the results of most studies do not support differences in outcome for African-American men as compared with Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/13,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic factors associated with prostate cancer and the implications for referral for screening and genetic evaluation are discussed separately.

The most important components of the diet and the intake of some vitamin and mineral supplements will be discussed here. The use of some of these compounds as chemopreventive agents is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemoprevention-strategies-in-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemoprevention strategies in prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Animal fat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diet high in animal fat may be an important factor in the development of prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. In particular, intake of large amounts of alpha-linolenic acid and low amounts of linoleic acid appear to be associated with increased risk; this combination is common in red meat and some dairy products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Vegetables</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diet low in vegetables may be another risk factor for prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/23,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28,29</a>]. A case-control study found a higher prostate cancer risk in men who consume less than 14 servings of vegetables weekly, compared with 28 or more servings (adjusted odds ratio 1.54) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, there was no association between fruit <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vegetable consumption and the risk of prostate cancer among 29,361 men in the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, 1338 of whom developed prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. High intake of cruciferous vegetables (particularly broccoli and cauliflower) was associated with a significantly lower risk of extra-prostatic tumors (stage III or IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110729\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110729 \">table 2</a>)) at presentation. Because the PLCO trial controls for prostate cancer screening, these data may be viewed as a particularly important study of dietary habits and prostate cancer risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11475694\"><span class=\"h2\">Lycopene and tomato based products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tomato-based products are rich in lycopene, which has potent anti-oxidant properties. These observations have led to analyses of the impact of lycopene and tomato-based products on the incidence and natural history of prostate cancer.</p><p>Initial studies of the impact of lycopene-containing foods on the risk of prostate cancer gave conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]; a 2007 United States Food and Drug Administration evidence-based review concluded that there was no credible evidence to support an association between lycopene intake and a reduced risk of prostate cancer, and only limited evidence to support an association between tomato consumption and reduced prostate cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>More recently, an analysis of a prospective cohort of 51,529 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study has suggested that dietary intake of lycopene is associated with a lower incidence of prostate cancer and a decreased risk of lethal prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Analysis of tumor biomarkers was consistent with a possible role of inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis as the mechanism underlying these observations. </p><p>Potential explanations for the difference between these observations and the conflicting results seen earlier include more detailed assessment of dietary lycopene, a wider range of lycopene levels compared with earlier studies, and the focus on the more aggressive prostate cancers. However, these data are observational and the possible role of confounding factors cannot be excluded. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Soy intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phytoestrogens (flavones, isoflavones, lignans) are naturally occurring plant compounds that have estrogen-like activity. Genistein and daidzein, the predominant isoflavones in human nutrition, are derived mainly from soybeans and other legumes.</p><p>It is postulated that phytoestrogens such as those found in soy foods may reduce prostate cancer risk either via their inherent estrogenic properties (which favorably alters the hormonal milieu), or by inhibition of the enzyme 5-AR, which decreases concentrations of the more prostate-active androgen dihydrotestosterone. The higher intake of soy products among Asian men has been hypothesized to be one reason for the lower incidence of prostate cancer among these men.</p><p>Although few human studies have been conducted, cohort studies have shown a modest protective benefit of soy intake on prostate cancer risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. A meta-analysis of two cohort and six case-control studies addressing the protective benefit of soy food intake on the risk of prostate cancer yielded an overall risk estimate of 0.70 (95% CI 0.59-0.83) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The utility of soy protein as a chemopreventive agent is discussed elsewhere.

These studies cannot be considered definitive, but these data concerning the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on prostate cancer risk should be considered in balancing the potential risks and benefits of these agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fish oil and marine omega-3 fatty acids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2001 meta-analysis based upon 235 studies that included over 117,000 cases failed to identify a consistent relationship between alcohol intake and prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This issue was subsequently addressed in the prospective Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. There was no association between alcohol consumption and prostate cancer risk in 10,660 men with no or moderate alcohol intake (0 to &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span>. However, among the 260 men consuming &ge;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> (2.4 percent of the entire population), the relative risk [RR] of high-grade prostate cancer was 2.0 (95% CI 1.3-3.1).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26833126\"><span class=\"h2\">Coffee</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing consumption of coffee appears to be associated with a decreased risk of lethal prostate cancer (defined as fatal or metastatic). A prospective analysis of almost 48,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study identified 5035 men with confirmed prostate cancer, including 642 who died or had metastatic disease, identified over a 20 year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The decrease in risk of lethal prostate cancer was inversely proportional to increases in coffee consumption (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.75, for those drinking six or more cups of coffee per day), and the decreased risk was present after controlling for other known prostate cancer risk factors. The inverse relationship appeared to be related to coffee components other than caffeine; a similar level of protection was seen for those drinking regular and decaffeinated coffee.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin and mineral supplements</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Multivitamins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The regular use of multivitamins does not appear to affect the risk of early or localized prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, two reports have observed an increased risk of advanced or fatal prostate cancer in men using relatively large amounts of multivitamins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>The potential relationship between the self-reported frequency of multivitamin use and prostate cancer was illustrated by a prospective study of 295,000 men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Multivariate analyses showed no significant increase in the overall incidence of prostate cancer, regardless of the frequency of multivitamin use. However, there was an increase in both advanced and fatal cases of prostate cancer among men using multivitamins more than seven times per week compared with those using such vitamins less frequently or not at all (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.67 and RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.07-3.66, respectively).</p><p>This increased risk of advanced or fatal prostate cancer may have been due to the increased use of multivitamins in men with symptoms of undiagnosed disease.

Higher folate levels were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio for top one-fifth versus bottom one-fifth 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.26), but the increased risk was limited to high-grade disease (odds ratio 2.30, 95% CI 1.28-4.12).

In contrast, the incidence or prostate cancer among 3114 men with rectal cancer and 24,578 with colon cancer who were treated without RT was similar to that expected in the general population.</p><p>In contrast to the findings from the SEER study, a decrease in the incidence of prostate cancer was not observed in two Swedish studies of men receiving EBRT for rectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. A possible explanation for the discrepant findings is that substantially lower doses of EBRT were used in the Swedish studies (25 Gy in five fractions versus typical regimens of 45 to 54 Gy in 1.8 to 2 Gy fractions in the United States).</p><p>At least two mechanisms could contribute to a reduction in the apparent risk of prostate cancer following EBRT for pelvic cancer. Incidental RT to the prostate may have a biologic effect, reducing or sterilizing subclinical areas of disease. Alternatively inadvertent irradiation of the prostate can decrease the serum PSA, which would diminish the diagnosis of prostate cancer without affecting its incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2263873240\"><span class=\"h2\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antecedent diagnosis of a depressive disorder adversely affects the choice of therapy.
