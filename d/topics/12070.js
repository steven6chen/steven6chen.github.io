Olfactory neuroblastomas are thought to arise from the olfactory epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation, pathology, treatment, and follow-up of patients with olfactory neuroblastomas will be reviewed here. Other malignancies of the nasal cavity and skull base are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumors-of-the-nasal-cavity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumors of the nasal cavity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paranasal-sinus-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paranasal sinus cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chordoma-and-chondrosarcoma-of-the-skull-base\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most representative data on the epidemiology of olfactory neuroblastomas come from an analysis of 311 cases in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database over a 30-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In this study, the mean age at presentation was 53 years, with most cases occurring in patients between 40 and 70 years. There was a moderate male predominance, with a 55:45 male:female ratio.</p><p>Other small, contemporary, single-institution series have yielded similar observations regarding age and gender distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal obstruction due to the presence of a mass is the most common symptom with olfactory neuroblastoma and is present in the majority of cases. Other manifestations of local disease include epistaxis, nasal discharge, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain. When nasal symptoms are present, physical examination usually reveals a red-brown, polypoid mass located high in the nasal cavity.</p><p>Symptoms can also be due to invasion of adjacent structures. Examples of symptoms due to local extension of tumor include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anosmia caused by tumor extension into the cribriform plate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, proptosis, diplopia, and excessive lacrimation due to orbital extension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear pain and otitis media because of obstruction of the eustachian tube</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frontal headache due to involvement of the frontal sinus</p><p/><p>Rarely, patients with olfactory neuroblastomas may have paraneoplastic syndromes due to hormone production, including ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>], hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], as well as neurological paraneoplastic syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1009356873\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of olfactory neuroblastoma requires a tissue biopsy, which is usually obtained during detailed examination of the nasal cavity. Delayed diagnosis is common. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1009356920\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no uniformly accepted staging system for patients with olfactory neuroblastoma.</p><p>The most widely used approach is the Kadish clinical staging system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As originally proposed, this was a three-tier classification based upon the extent of the primary tumor. This was subsequently modified to include a separate category for patients with lymph node or distant metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57376 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage A &ndash; Confined to the nasal cavity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage B &ndash; Involvement of one or more paranasal sinuses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage C &ndash; Extension beyond the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage D &ndash; Regional lymph node or distant metastasis</p><p/><p>The Dulguerov system, based upon a tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) type of classification, may provide superior stratification of patients into prognostic groups (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F105457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105457 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Olfactory neuroblastomas are generally slow-growing tumors and symptoms are nonspecific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. In a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database study that included 261 cases with sufficient data to permit staging, only 17 percent had disease confined to the nasal cavity, while 54 percent had local disease extending beyond the nasal cavity, and 29 percent had regional or distant metastases (Kadish stages A, B plus C, and D, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs may have revealed an intranasal soft tissue density as part of an initial diagnostic evaluation. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) help to differentiate tumor from other causes of nasal obstruction and are essential for tumor staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. When the tumor is more extensive, bone destruction and opacification of paranasal sinuses may be seen.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT provides the best information about invasion into bony structures and permits detailed assessment of bony erosion or destruction, particularly of the cribriform plate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI is more accurate for defining the margins of tumor extension into adjacent soft tissue areas, such as the anterior cranial fossa and the orbital tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are only very limited data on the role of positron emission tomography (PET) and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In one study, PET correctly identified 17 of 20 extracranial metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This imaging may have a role as an adjunct to staging in patients with locally advanced (Kadish C) or high-grade (Hyams grade III or IV) disease, where there is a significant risk of lymphatic metastases or distant disease.</p><p/><p>Imaging studies cannot differentiate olfactory neuroblastomas from other tumors. Origin from the superior nasal cavity medial to the middle turbinate is highly suggestive of olfactory neuroblastoma. Definitive diagnosis requires histologic examination of a biopsy or surgical specimen and may require electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.)</p><p>Imaging studies are also used to look for evidence of regional or distant metastases at presentation and may include CT, MRI, or PET. PET may be helpful in differentiating lymphatic metastases from benign lymphadenopathy when a borderline enlarged lymph node does not meet other criteria for malignancy, such as peripheral enhancement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> central necrosis. Retropharyngeal lymph nodes are also at risk for metastatic disease, but level II lymph nodes are most frequently involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On gross examination, biopsy material from olfactory neuroblastoma is soft and hemorrhagic. Resection specimens may show a polypoid appearance. Microscopically, the tumor grows beneath the surface respiratory epithelium and may produce focal ulceration. The vascular supply is rich and fragile, accounting for the hemorrhagic gross appearance. </p><p>In low-grade (well-differentiated) lesions, the growth pattern is lobulated with transitions into sheets or discrete nests of tumor cells, which are small and round with high nuclear cytoplasmic ratios (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50794\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50794 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In well-differentiated tumors, the nuclei show uniform chromatin distribution with small inconspicuous nucleoli. The nuclei become progressively more pleomorphic, with coarse chromatin clumping and prominent nucleoli, with increasing tumor grade. The stroma in well-differentiated tumors is distinctly fibrillary, reflecting the neuronal (axonal) processes made by the tumor cells. This stroma decreases in quantity as the tumor becomes less well differentiated. Mitoses and areas of necrosis also become more frequent with increasing tumor grade.</p><p>Homer Wright pseudorosettes, which are composed of tumor cells surrounding a center of pink fibrillary material, are seen in one-half of olfactory neuroblastomas; true (Flexner type) rosettes, composed of tumor cells surrounding a central lumen, are best seen in higher-grade tumors. Necrosis, dystrophic calcification, and vascular or lymphatic invasion are more common with increasing tumor grade. In rare instances, a few admixed ganglion cells may be present. Electron microscopy of olfactory neuroblastomas demonstrates numerous axonal-type cytoplasmic processes, which contain neurofilaments, neurotubules, and dense-core neurosecretory granules (100 to 200 nm in diameter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The S-100 immunoreactivity corresponds to Schwann cells enveloping cell bodies and axonal processes. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The Hyams histologic grading system grades tumors from I to IV based upon pathologic features such as mitotic activity and necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I tumors are characterized by a prominent fibrillary matrix, tumor cells with uniform nuclei, absent mitotic activity, and absent necrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II tumors have some fibrillary matrix and exhibit moderate nuclear pleomorphism with some mitotic activity. There is no necrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III tumors have a minimal fibrillary matrix and Flexner type rosettes are present. There are more prominent mitotic activity and nuclear pleomorphism, and some necrosis may be seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade IV tumors have no fibrillary matrix or rosettes and show marked nuclear pleomorphism and increased mitotic activity with frequent necrosis.</p><p/><p>Most studies have found a correlation between Hyams grade and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/13,17,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17,21,23</a>]. In a meta-analysis that included five studies in which lesions were graded histologically, the mean five-year survival was 56 percent for those with low-grade lesions (Hyams I and II) versus 20 percent for those with high-grade lesions (Hyams III and IV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) study of 281 patients treated from 1973 to 2010 showed that patients with grade I and II tumors had a 10-year overall survival rate of 67 percent and that those with high-grade tumors (III and IV) had a 10-year overall survival rate of 34 percent. For high-grade tumors, multivariate analysis showed that Kadish stage predicted for worse disease-specific survival and that radiation independently predicted for improved disease-specific survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While well-differentiated olfactory neuroblastoma is apparent histologically, less well-differentiated forms often require additional evaluation to refine the differential diagnosis, which includes neuroendocrine carcinoma, sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC), rhabdomyosarcoma, melanoma, Ewing sarcoma, and metastatic tumors. Distinguishing among these tumors may have therapeutic significance, since the biological behavior and prognosis may differ.</p><p>In the past, electron microscopy was an important diagnostic modality in sorting out the various entities. Electron microscopy has largely been supplanted by immunohistochemistry and, more recently, cytogenetics. By immunostaining, approximately 65 percent of olfactory neuroblastomas yield positive reactions for synaptophysin and a lesser proportion for chromogranin. In some cases, tumor cells may be positive for neurofilament or cytokeratin, the latter often being focal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. The supporting or sustentacular cells are positive for S-100 protein; positive reactions for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) are inconsistent. Tumor cells are negative for a variety of other markers, such as cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), leukocyte common antigen, kappa and lambda light chains, human monoclonal antibody 45 (HMB45), desmin, myoglobin, vimentin, and MIC2 (cluster of differentiation 99 [CD99]), the Ewing sarcoma marker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p>Other tumors that may be confused with olfactory neuroblastoma include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma &ndash; SNUC is an aggressive neoplasm that is derived from Schneiderian epithelium. It is composed of medium-sized, polygonal cells with round to oval hyperchromatic nuclei and a scant to moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Tumor cells are arranged in nests, wide trabeculae, ribbons, and sheets, with surface dysplasia. Mitoses, necrosis, and vascular invasion are often present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Neurofibrillary stroma and pseudorosettes are absent, but sparse neurosecretory granules may be seen if electron microscopy is done. Tumor cells are reactive for cytokeratin (90 percent) and EMA (65 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms#H84270870\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of head and neck neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Olfactory neuroblastoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhabdomyosarcoma &ndash; Rhabdomyosarcomas are distinguished from other malignant neoplasms by evidence of skeletal muscle differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. The diagnosis is typically made by finding rhabdomyoblasts and cross striations on routine sections. In the past, ultrastructural studies might demonstrate actin and myosin filaments with Z band and intermediate filaments. Using current conventional immunohistochemistry, more than 90 percent of rhabdomyosarcomas are positive for desmin and 50 to 90 percent for myoglobin. Myogenic differentiation 1 (Myo-D-1) and myogenin are additional useful antibodies. A smaller number express cytokeratin and S-100 protein. Another useful diagnostic aid is the presence of a consistent chromosomal rearrangement, t(2;13) (q35;q14), in the alveolar type of rhabdomyosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-sarcomas#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Rhabdomyosarcoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ewing sarcoma &ndash; Ewing sarcoma and related primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) are characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(11;22) (q24;q12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, Ewing sarcoma is MIC2 (CD99) positive. In one study of 69 round cell lesions of the sinonasal region (22 olfactory neuroblastomas, 17 malignant lymphomas, 9 Ewing sarcomas, 9 rhabdomyosarcomas, 3 SNUCs, 5 melanomas, and 4 pituitary adenomas), each of the cases of Ewing sarcoma was positive for MIC2; all other tumors were MIC2 negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Olfactory neuroblastomas also lack the Ewing sarcoma chromosomal translocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-staging-and-prognostic-factors-of-the-ewing-sarcoma-family-of-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroendocrine carcinoma &ndash; The distinction between poorly-differentiated olfactory neuroblastoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma may be difficult as the morphologic overlap may be considerable. Histologically, these are both high-grade small cell lesions. Neuroendocrine carcinoma more typically grows in irregular nests and sheets, exhibiting brisk mitotic activity and frequent necrosis. A lobular growth pattern is absent. The stroma is desmoplastic and fibrotic, without any fibrillary quality apparent histologically. Artifactual cytologic &quot;crush&quot; effect may be present. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Neuroendocrine carcinoma is a histologic mimic of small cell carcinoma of pulmonary origin and often demonstrates similar histologic, cytologic, and immunohistochemical characteristics. Thorough clinical evaluation, including chest imaging, is required to exclude a metastatic lesion. Neuroendocrine carcinoma, however, is more diffusely cytokeratin positive as compared with olfactory neuroblastoma. Other immunostaining features, eg, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56, while focally distributed in neuroendocrine carcinoma, are expressed by both tumors such that their presence should be regarded as nonspecific in terms of separating these two tumors. Immunoreactivity for S-100 is scant to absent. Both tumors are populated by dense-core (&quot;neurosecretory&quot;) cytoplasmic granules, although ultrastructural examination is seldom employed these days.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment for patients with olfactory neuroblastoma has not been established in randomized clinical trials; observational studies generally have had limited numbers of patients due to the rarity of this disease. Furthermore, the natural history of the disease necessitates prolonged observation to adequately assess the results of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Currently, there is insufficient information regarding genetic and molecular alterations in olfactory neuroblastoma to guide therapeutic decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, surgery, radiation therapy (RT), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy have all been used in the treatment of primary olfactory neuroblastomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Observational studies generally indicate that combining surgery and RT has resulted in prolonged disease-free and overall survival compared with either surgery or RT alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical resection of olfactory neuroblastomas originally used a transfacial approach. However, multiple observational studies found that a combined craniofacial approach improved the ability to achieve an en bloc resection and resulted in better local control of disease and improved survival compared with a transfacial approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/13,23,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23,40,41</a>].</p><p>Advances in surgical techniques have led to the development of a minimally invasive endoscopic approach in carefully selected patients as a way to minimize complications and improve the cosmetic outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. A meta-analysis of olfactory neuroblastoma that included 361 patients in 23 published studies demonstrated a greater published survival rate for endoscopic surgery compared with open surgery, even when taking into account the year of publication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Although the patient groups had similar follow-up, patients treated with endoscopic surgery had earlier-stage tumors, suggesting a selection bias. The availability and preference of surgical approach vary between institutions. An endoscopic surgical technique may be combined with a neurosurgical approach for the intracranial component of disease, or with RT.</p><p>Currently, surgery alone for the initial management of patients with an olfactory neuroblastoma is generally restricted to carefully selected patients with Kadish stage A olfactory neuroblastoma because of the high risk of local recurrence and the better results of a combined-modality approach that includes RT. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Surgery plus RT'</a> below.)</p><p>Nonrandomized studies suggest equivalence of outcomes with different surgical approaches.

Treatment was successful in preventing disease recurrence in all six cases with Kadish stage A disease at a median follow-up of over eight years. However, for patients with more extensive disease (Kadish stage B and C disease), treatment was successful in only 7 of 12 (58 percent) and 7 of 37 (19 percent) cases, respectively.</p><p>Highly conformal techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton beam therapy, are now standard to minimize toxicity to adjacent critical structures (retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, brain stem and brain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Proton beam therapy has been utilized to reduce the dose of radiation to critical organs, and to reduce the integral dose to the region and, thus, further reduce toxicity, including radiation-induced malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/olfactory-neuroblastoma-esthesioneuroblastoma/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].
