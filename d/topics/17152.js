Three main types of inhaler devices are available, the pressurized metered dose inhaler (MDI), the dry powder inhaler (DPI), and the soft mist inhaler (SMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85082029\"><span class=\"h2\">Metered dose inhalers with CFC and HFA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MDI devices consist of a pressurized canister, a metering valve and stem, and a mouthpiece actuator (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62613\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62613 \">picture 1</a>). The pressurized canister contains the drug suspended in a mixture of propellants, surfactants, preservatives, flavoring agents, and dispersal agents. Following adoption of the Montreal protocol, an international agreement to ban chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the CFC-free propellant hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-134a has replaced CFC-containing devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/12-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-24</a>]. Delivery of most aerosol medications to the lungs is comparable between HFA and traditional CFC devices, although a few of the HFAs deliver a greater portion of the dose than the comparable CFC MDI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/21,25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85082036\"><span class=\"h2\">Dry powder inhalers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DPIs are breath-actuated devices that deliver micronized drug particles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of less than 5 &micro;m, which usually are aggregated with carrier particles (such as lactose or glucose) of greater diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Drug is delivered to the airways by the inhalation of air over a punctured capsule, blister, or reservoir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Inspiratory flow rates of 30 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> are required to disaggregate and aerosolize the drug when using a DPI device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347194473\"><span class=\"h2\">Soft mist inhalers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SMIs release the medication in a soft mist, which lasts in the air about six times longer than the aerosol from an MDI. The mist is propellant-free, but does contain benzalkonium chloride. Approximately 75 percent of the aerosolized particles produced by the Respimat SMI have a mean aerodynamic diameter &le;5.8 &micro;m and &le;3 to 5 percent of the particles have a diameter &lt;1 &micro;m. Particles less than 1 &micro;m tend to be exhaled, rather than impacting on the airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>The lower velocity of the aerosol decreases oropharyngeal deposition. The longer duration of the aerosol cloud increases the window for successful inhalation, thus reducing problems with co-ordination between actuation and inhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62570469\"><span class=\"h1\">SPACERS AND HOLDING CHAMBERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using a spacer or valved holding chamber with a metered dose inhaler (MDI) allows the velocity of particles to decrease before reaching the mouth, which decreases the amount of oropharyngeal deposition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58957\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58957 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Use of a valved holding chamber also allows sequential actuation and inhalation as the aerosol is retained in the chamber after actuation of the MDI. We typically prescribe a valved holding chamber for patients with difficulty coordinating inhalation actuation and inhalation and for those using MDIs containing glucocorticoids, especially if the dose is in the medium to high range. Spacers are less expensive than valved holding chambers and may be a better option in resource-limited settings, although they do not allow for sequential actuation and inhalation. Spacers and valved holding chambers require a prescription from a clinician.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spacers -</strong> A spacer is usually an open-ended tube or bag that is of sufficient volume to allow the aerosol plume from the MDI to expand and the propellant to evaporate. The spacer should be at least 100 to 700 mL in volume, and should provide a distance of 10 to 13 cm between the MDI nozzle and the mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. By dispersing the aerosol into the spacer, the individual medication droplets experience slight evaporative loss of the propellant, which decreases the droplet size and thereby decreases oral deposition of the aerosol. The spacer holds the medicine aerosol long enough for patients to inhale slowly and deeply (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58957\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58957 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Spacers can increase the bioavailability of inhaled medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, the dose can be lost or diluted if the patient exhales into the spacer prior to inhalation of the dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Valved-holding chambers</strong> &ndash; The valved-holding chamber (VHC) is a specialized spacer that incorporates a one-way valve between the chamber and the mouthpiece. This design permits sequential actuation and inhalation as the aerosol is retained in the chamber after actuation of the MDI. In addition, the valve prevents the exhaled breath from entering the chamber, so the aerosol medication is held in the chamber to allow a second or third inhalation, if needed. Commonly used valved holding chambers include rigid devices, such as the AeroChamber, and plastic collapsible holding chambers, such as the InspirEase bag (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58957\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58957 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Retention of aerosol within the chamber of a VHC for a finite time post pMDI actuation produces a finer aerosol because of impaction of large particles and partial evaporation of propellant from the aerosol droplets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several issues are important to the correct use of a VHC. Only one actuation should be placed into the chamber for each inhalation, as multiple actuations into the chamber reduces the overall amount of drug inhaled. The time between actuation and inhalation should be as short as possible, because the aerosol is lost to the walls of the device due to gravitational sedimentation, inertial impaction, and electrostatic charge. Electrostatic charge can be minimized by washing the device in detergent, rinsing, and allowing it to air dry. Alternatively, a nonelectrostatic chamber can be used, but these are costlier.</p><p/><p>Despite the variety and popularity of spacer devices, little information is available on their relative performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/38,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,44</a>]. In general, larger sized spacers appear more effective than smaller ones, but proper technique remains important for obtaining optimal drug delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103302 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103303 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. A point of controversy is whether or not a VHC is necessary for delivery of non-steroid drugs when the patient demonstrates good technique with the pMDI alone, as the use of the chamber adds cost and complexity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

A less common problem is that of an insufficient breath-hold after inhalation of the medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper airway deposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) tend to spray out medication more quickly than the patient can inhale. In addition, some patients do not inhale long enough after actuation of the device. As a result, a substantial amount of the medication is deposited in the back of the throat or on the tongue. Oropharyngeal deposition results in inefficient medication delivery and, with inhaled glucocorticoids, may cause hoarseness and thrush. It has been estimated that, in most patients, only about 10 percent of the dose reaches the lungs, while 80 percent remains in the oropharynx, although this varies depending on the preparation and delivery device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/3,28,29,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,28,29,48-50</a>].</p><p>Use of hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) MDIs may diminish oropharyngeal deposition as they tend to deliver a greater proportion of the actuated dose to the airways in the lungs and less to the oropharynx compared with chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) MDIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/28-30,49,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30,49,51</a>].</p><p>Another way to address this problem is to add a spacer device or valved holding chamber, which can decrease the oral deposition of medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a study comparing HFA and CFC formulations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beclomethasone</a> with and without a valved holding chamber or large volume spacer, the valved holding chamber and spacer decreased oropharyngeal deposition from approximately 80 percent to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H62570469\" class=\"local\">'Spacers and holding chambers'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Actuation-inhalation coordination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The other major cause of inefficient delivery of inhaled medications is lack of coordination between actuation and inhalation. The use of a valved holding chamber allows the patient to sequentially activate the inhaler into the chamber and then inhale the medication. In addition, dry powder inhalers (DPIs) that contain the medication in the form of a powder are breath actuated. The force of the patient's inhalation draws the powder into the lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57922\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57922 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].
