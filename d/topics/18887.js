Clinical manifestations include hepatic dysfunction, renal failure, coagulopathy, and shock. Travelers to tropical regions of South America and sub-Saharan Africa where the disease is endemic are at risk for acquisition of infection and require immunization.</p><p>Issues related to virology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of yellow fever will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY, PATHOGENESIS, AND HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yellow fever is the prototype member of the family Flaviviridae, a group of small (40 to 60 nm), enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Yellow fever virus is a single serotype and is antigenically conserved, so the vaccine protects against all strains of the virus. At the nucleotide sequence level, it is possible to distinguish seven major genotypes representing West Africa (two genotypes), Central-East Africa and Angola (three genotypes), and South America (two genotypes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Humans are highly susceptible to infection and disease. Most nonhuman primate species are susceptible to infection, and some species of nonhuman primates develop clinical manifestations.</p><p>An infected female mosquito inoculates approximately 1000 to 100,000 virus particles intradermally during blood feeding. Virus replication begins at the site of inoculation, probably in dendritic cells in the epidermis, and spreads through lymphatic channels to regional lymph nodes. Lymphoid cells, particularly monocyte-macrophages and large histiocytes, appear to be the preferred cell types for primary replication. The virus reaches other organs via the lymph and then the bloodstream, seeding other tissues. Large amounts of virus are produced in the liver, lymph nodes, and spleen and are released into the blood. During the viremic phase (days three to six), infection may be transmitted to blood-feeding mosquitoes.</p><p>Yellow fever is characterized by hepatic dysfunction, renal failure, coagulopathy, and shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The midzone of the liver lobule is principally affected, with sparing of cells bordering the central vein and portal tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Viral antigen localizes to the midzone, indicating that it is the site of direct viral injury. Very high virus loads have been found in the liver and spleen of fatal cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Injury to hepatocytes is characterized by eosinophilic degeneration with condensed nuclear chromatin (Councilman bodies) rather than by the ballooning and rarefaction necrosis seen in viral hepatitis. Liver cell death is due to apoptosis. Hepatocytes in the midzone of the liver lobule express Fas ligand, and lymphocytes infiltrating the liver mediate apoptosis. Inflammatory cells, mainly CD4+ cells, are present in low numbers; smaller numbers of NK and CD8+ cells are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. There is no disruption of the reticular architecture of the liver. In nonfatal cases, healing is complete without postnecrotic fibrosis. In fatal cases, approximately 80 percent of hepatocytes undergo coagulative necrosis.</p><p>Renal damage is characterized by eosinophilic degeneration and fatty change of renal tubular epithelium without inflammation. These findings are believed to be a result of both direct viral injury and nonspecific changes due to hypotension and the hepatorenal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Focal injury to the myocardium, characterized by cell degeneration and fatty change, is the result of viral replication.</p><p>The hemorrhagic diathesis in yellow fever is due to decreased synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors by the liver, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and platelet dysfunction.</p><p>The late phase of the disease is characterized by circulatory shock. The underlying mechanism may be cytokine dysregulation, as in the sepsis syndrome. In a series of patients with fatal yellow fever, levels of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, and interferon-inducible protein-10) were elevated compared with patients with nonfatal yellow fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients dying of yellow fever have cerebral edema at autopsy, probably the result of microvascular dysfunction. Large amounts of complement-fixing antigen (presumably NS1) have been found in blood of severely ill yellow fever patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Some nonhuman primate species develop fatal infection with features similar to the disease in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A model of yellow fever infection in hamsters has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Clinical, immunologic, and pathologic features resemble human infection, suggesting that this model might serve to increase the understanding of the pathogenesis of infection and to explore possible treatments. <span class=\"nowrap\">Interferon-alpha/beta</span> receptor-deficient mice are also susceptible to viscerotropic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1301185932\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yellow fever occurs in tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa and South America; it is an epidemic disease problem of considerable magnitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The incidence of endemic disease is not well established, but approximately 1 percent of individuals with severe hepatitis in endemic areas of Africa may be caused by yellow fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. An estimate from serologic and epidemiologic data concluded that there were 130,000 cases with viscerotropic disease and 78,000 deaths in Africa in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The incidence of yellow fever in Africa varies widely, and the disease occurs in epidemics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A large <em>Aedes aegypti</em>&ndash;borne epidemic occurred in Angola and neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo in <span class=\"nowrap\">south/central</span> Africa between December 2015 and July 2016 with over 2930 confirmed or suspected cases and 253 deaths and resulting in the emergency distribution of 30 million doses of vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Mosquito-borne epidemics in Africa occur where large human populations reside in high density and immunization coverage is low. The highest number of outbreaks has occurred in West Africa, but this situation is changing due to a concerted effort to undertake mass immunization campaigns in that region. Human-to-human transmission in the absence of the mosquito has not been reported.</p><p>Fewer cases occur in South America than in Africa because transmission occurs from enzootic sources (principally from monkey to human via mosquito vectors), the vector density is relatively low, and vaccination coverage is relatively high (80 to 90 percent in endemic areas of South America). In typical years, there are several hundred cases officially notified, but in epidemic years up to 5000 cases are reported. </p><p>In Africa and South America, only a small proportion of cases is officially recorded because the disease often occurs in remote areas, recognition of outbreaks is delayed, and diagnostic facilities are limited. In Africa, reports of outbreaks in the 1980s noted the incidence of yellow fever infection to be 20 to 40 percent, the incidence of severe disease to be 3 to 5 percent, and the case-fatality rate to be 20 to 30 percent. In contrast, case-fatality rates in South America are consistently 50 to 60 percent. It is uncertain whether these disparities reflect reporting artifact, a real difference in virus strain virulence, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> differing genetic susceptibility of the human populations. A racial difference in susceptibility is likely, supported by an analysis of epidemiologic data from an 1878 epidemic in Tennessee, in which yellow fever attack rates were similar in the Caucasian and non-Caucasian populations of the city, but the case-fatality rate was 6.8-fold higher in Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Yellow fever epidemics have never been reported in Asia, and introduction to that region could have devastating effects since there is no background of specific immunity, and the urban vector (<em>Aedes aegypti</em>) is prevalent. In the context of the 2016 yellow fever outbreak in Angola, at least 11 Chinese workers developed yellow fever upon travel home to China, illustrating the danger of introduction and potential secondary spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Prior to the reports among travelers from Angola, yellow fever in expatriates and travelers to and from Africa and South America has been rare since the introduction of vaccination after World War II. Since that time, 10 cases had been recorded up to the time of the 2016 Angolan outbreak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/8,25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25-29</a>]. The situation in Angola appears to be linked to a large number of Chinese construction workers and other expatriates who entered the country without vaccination. Changes in human demography, particularly expansion of urban populations throughout the tropics, expansion of air travel, and rapid spread of other viruses (dengue, Zika, chikungunya) transmitted between humans by urban <em>Ae. aegypti </em>throughout the southern hemisphere illustrate the global dangers associated with exportation and spread of yellow fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96762949\"><span class=\"h3\">Outbreak in Brazil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ongoing yellow fever outbreak in Brazil began in December 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Between July 1, 2017, and February 16, 2018, 464 confirmed human cases of yellow fever were reported in Brazil, including 154 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In March 2018, the Brazilian health ministry issued a recommendation for universal yellow fever vaccination in Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Since January 2018, 10 travel-related cases have been reported in international travelers returning from Brazil, including four deaths; none of the 10 travelers had received yellow fever vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In March 2018, the United States Centers for Disease Control issued an <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/yellow-fever-brazil&amp;token=MmgyN0jwL1Npa11Wu+cskaJdeq22vsN4NOWCSkViONLRDmtvJtPOcMtP+d/ioXPIGGgMTgwHHKHF71VCSUAxTGyGKOhpDgkW1lP/jvBV4Tg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3032\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">advisory</a>, which expanded the regions within Brazil for which travelers should receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=yellow-fever-vaccine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">yellow fever vaccine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission cycles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary transmission cycle involves monkeys and daytime biting mosquitoes (<em>Aedes</em> species in Africa, <em>Haemagogus</em> species in South America).</p><p>In Africa, a wide array of <em>Aedes</em> vectors is responsible for transmission. During the rainy season, the virus circulates via mosquitoes in the savanna vegetational zone in proximity to human settlements. Both humans and nonhuman primates can be hosts in the transmission cycle, and the rate of virus transmission may accelerate to reach epidemic levels. <em>Aedes aegypti</em>, a common domestic mosquito that can breed in containers used to store potable water in heavily settled areas, is capable of serving as an epidemic vector with humans as the intermediate viremic hosts (so-called &quot;urban yellow fever&quot;).</p><p>In South America, the larval development of mosquitoes occurs in areas such as tree holes containing rainwater. Persons entering forested areas are at risk of infection (so-called &quot;jungle yellow fever&quot;); this accounts for the predominance of cases among young males engaged in forest clearing and agriculture. In the 1970s, the <em>Aedes aegypti</em> mosquito reinvaded areas of South America where it previously had been eradicated, increasing the risk that urban yellow fever may reemerge. The first well-documented instance of an urban-cycle epidemic since 1942 occurred in Paraguay in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical spectrum of yellow fever includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subclinical infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abortive, nonspecific febrile illness without jaundice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Life-threatening disease with fever, jaundice, renal failure, and hemorrhage</p><p/><p>Yellow fever affects all ages, but disease severity and lethality is highest in older adults. The onset of illness appears abruptly three to six days (median 4.3 days) after the bite of an infected mosquito [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The classical illness is characterized by three stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Period of infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Period of remission</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Period of intoxication</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Period of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The period of infection consists of viremia, which lasts for three to four days. The patient is febrile and complains of generalized malaise, headache, photophobia, lumbosacral pain, pain in the lower extremities, myalgia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, restlessness, irritability, and dizziness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Symptoms and signs are relatively nonspecific; at this phase, it is virtually impossible to distinguish yellow fever from other acute infections.</p><p>On physical examination, the patient appears acutely ill with flushed skin, reddening of the conjunctivae and gums, and epigastric tenderness. Enlargement of the liver with tenderness may be present. The tongue is characteristically red at the tip and sides with a white coating in the center. The pulse rate is slow relative to the height of the fever (Faget's sign). The temperature is typically 39&ordm;C but may rise as high as 41&ordm;C.</p><p>Laboratory abnormalities include leukopenia (1500 to 2500 per microL) with relative neutropenia; leukopenia occurs rapidly after the onset of illness. Serum transaminase levels start to rise 48 and 72 hours after onset of illness, prior to the appearance of jaundice. The degree of liver enzyme abnormalities at this stage may predict the severity of hepatic dysfunction later in the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Period of remission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A period of remission lasting up to 48 hours may follow the period of infection, characterized by the abatement of fever and symptoms. Patients with abortive infections recover at this stage. Approximately 15 percent of individuals infected with yellow fever virus enter the third stage of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Period of intoxication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The period of intoxication begins on the third to sixth day after the onset of infection with return of fever, prostration, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, jaundice, oliguria, and hemorrhagic diathesis. The viremia terminates at this stage and antibodies appear in the blood. This phase is characterized by variable dysfunction of multiple organs including the liver, kidneys, and cardiovascular system. Multiorgan failure in yellow fever is associated with high levels of proinflammatory cytokines similar to that seen in bacterial sepsis and systemic immune response syndrome (SIRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic dysfunction due to yellow fever differs from other viral hepatitides in that serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels exceed those of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). This may be due to concomitant viral injury to the myocardium and skeletal muscle. The levels are proportional to disease severity. In one study, the mean AST and ALT levels in fatal cases were 2766 and 660 U, respectively, while in surviving patients with jaundice, the mean levels were 929 and 351 U [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or only slightly elevated. Direct bilirubin levels are typically between 5 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> with higher levels in fatal than in nonfatal cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal damage is characterized by oliguria, azotemia, and very high levels of protein in the urine. Serum creatinine levels are three to eight times normal. In some patients who survive the hepatitic phase, renal failure predominates. Death is preceded by virtually complete anuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemorrhage is a prominent component of the third phase of illness, including coffee-grounds hematemesis, melena, hematuria, metrorrhagia, petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis, oozing of blood from the gums, and bleeding from needle puncture sites. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage may contribute to circulatory collapse. Laboratory abnormalities include thrombocytopenia, prolonged prothrombin time, and global reductions in clotting factors synthesized by the liver (factors II, V, VII, IX, and X). Some patients have findings suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation, including diminished fibrinogen and factor VIII and the presence of fibrin split products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Myocardial injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical significance of myocardial injury is poorly understood and probably has been underestimated in clinical studies. In some cases, acute cardiac enlargement has been documented during the course of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The electrocardiogram may show sinus bradycardia without conduction defects, ST-T abnormalities, particularly elevated T waves, and extrasystoles. Bradycardia and myocarditis may contribute to hypotension, reduced perfusion, and metabolic acidosis in severe cases. Arrhythmia has been suggested to explain the rare reports of late death during convalescence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Central nervous system dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients exhibit variable signs of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction including delirium, agitation, convulsions, stupor, and coma. In severe cases, the cerebrospinal fluid is under increased pressure and may contain elevated protein but no cells. Pathologic changes include microscopic perivascular hemorrhages and edema. Given the absence of inflammatory changes suggesting viral neuroinvasion and encephalitis, CNS alterations are probably due to metabolic encephalopathy. True yellow fever viral encephalitis is exceedingly rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcome is determined during the second week after onset, at which point the patient either dies or rapidly recovers. Approximately 20 to 50 percent of patients who enter the period of intoxication succumb to the disease. Poor prognostic signs include anuria, shock, hypothermia, agitation, delirium, intractable hiccups, seizures, hypoglycemia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, Cheyne-Stokes respirations, stupor, and coma.</p><p>Convalescence may be associated with fatigue lasting for several weeks. In some cases, jaundice and serum transaminase elevations may persist for months, although such patients may have yellow fever superimposed on other hematologic or hepatic diseases. The outcome of yellow fever appears to be comparable in patients with or without hepatitis B surface antigenemia.</p><p>Complications of yellow fever include bacterial superinfections, such as pneumonia, parotitis, and sepsis. Late deaths during convalescence occur rarely and have been attributed to myocarditis, arrhythmia, or heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis is made by serology, detection of viral genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), by viral isolation or histopathology, and immunohistochemistry on postmortem tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic diagnosis is best accomplished using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM. The presence of IgM antibodies in a single sample provides a presumptive diagnosis; confirmation is made by a rise in titer between paired acute and convalescent samples or a fall between early and late convalescent samples.</p><p>Persistence of antibodies from earlier receipt of the live-attenuated vaccine can complicate interpretation of IgM results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In addition, cross-reactions with other flaviviruses complicate the diagnosis of yellow fever by serologic methods, particularly in Africa where multiple flaviviruses circulate. The neutralization test is more specific but requires a specialized laboratory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapid diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid diagnostic tests include PCR to detect viral genome in the blood or tissue and ELISA for determination of IgM antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Next-generation sequencing of RNA directly amplified from blood has been used to confirm the diagnosis and compare the patient&rsquo;s strain to known geographic clades of the virus. These tools are increasingly available in national and regional laboratories in the endemic areas. A reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) yellow fever diagnostic test, which does not require thermocycling equipment and can be read visually, has shown promise as a sensitive and rapid test for use in field conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Virus isolation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virus isolation is accomplished by inoculation of mosquito or mammalian cell cultures, intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice, or intrathoracic inoculation of mosquitoes. The virus may also be recovered from postmortem liver tissue. During a yellow fever outbreak in Ivory Coast in 1982 including 90 confirmed cases, 30 percent were diagnosed by virus isolation from the blood; the majority of patients had detectable virus prior to onset of jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver biopsy during illness due to yellow fever should never be performed, since fatal hemorrhage may ensue. Postmortem histopathologic examination of the liver often demonstrates the typical features of yellow fever including midzonal necrosis. A definitive postmortem diagnosis may be made by immunocytochemical staining for yellow fever antigen in the liver, heart, spleen, or kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Virology, pathogenesis, and histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5389867\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of yellow fever includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E) &ndash; These entities are characterized by elevated transaminases; hepatitis A and E are acute infections transmitted most frequently by the fecal-oral route, whereas hepatitis B, C, and D can present acutely or chronically and are transmitted by body fluids. In Africa, severe and fatal hepatitis E in pregnancy has frequently been misdiagnosed as yellow fever. (See related topics.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influenza &ndash; Influenza is associated with fever, headache, malaise, and myalgias. It is not generally associated with severe hepatic involvement or jaundice.

Cases in infants have diminished since restriction of vaccine administration to children more than nine months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1764332857\"><span class=\"h4\">Viscerotropic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>YEL-AVD refers to a syndrome resembling wild-type yellow fever infection that occurs in the setting of yellow fever 17D vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/104,110-112\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,110-112</a>]. Case definitions have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Onset of illness generally occurs three to five days after vaccination with fever, malaise, jaundice, oliguria, cardiovascular instability, and hemorrhage. The case-fatality rate of YEL-AVD is 63 percent, and there is no specific treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/104,114,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,114,115</a>].</p><p>The estimated incidence of YEL-AVD in the United States is 0.4 per 100,000 but may be sixfold higher among individuals &ge;60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Based on the relatively small series of cases, there appears to be a higher incidence in young adult females. In Peru, an unexplained, high incidence of YEL-AVD was reported during a mass immunization campaign (7.9 per 100,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. In a large experience of 38 million vaccinations given in West Africa between 2007 and 2010, during which pharmacovigilance was undertaken, few serious adverse events and only five suspected YEL-AVD cases were found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>], emphasizing the high safety record of the vaccine.</p><p>Nevertheless, there have been more reports of deaths due to YEL-AVD than due to wild-type disease in unvaccinated travelers. This emphasizes the importance of careful assessment for vaccination need based on full understanding of disease epidemiology and travel itinerary, to avoid unnecessary risk of vaccine adverse effects but to ensure that patients with risk for exposure are protected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Identifying risk factors for YEL-AVD is difficult because of the relatively low incidence. YEL-AVD does not appear to be caused by mutational changes in the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/89,104,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,104,116</a>]. Rather, YEL-AVD is probably related to defects in host innate immunity; in affected individuals, the early antiviral response appears to be impaired, allowing unchecked viral replication before activation of the adaptive immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].</p><p>Acquired host factors appear to increase the risk of developing YEL-AVD after vaccination: advanced age and thymus disease and possibly female gender in younger persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/104,108,109,114,118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,108,109,114,118,119</a>]. A study in older adults showed that viremia caused by yellow fever 17D vaccine was prolonged and the antibody response delayed, foreshadowing the role of immune senescence in cases with YEL-AVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Thymus disease (eg, thymoma, myasthenia gravis) was present in 4 of the 23 reported cases; all underwent thymectomy 2 to 20 years before vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. In addition, thymic involution increases with age and the associated immune suppression might contribute to the increase in risk of YEL-AVD in older adults. A fatal case in a patient with a thymoma detected only at autopsy illustrates the difficulty in assessing underlying acquired risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. There is some evidence that immune dysregulation associated with autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Addison's disease, may also be a risk factor for YEL-AVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/18,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,116</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2948952405\"><span class=\"h3\">Development of safer vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious adverse events (except acute hypersensitivity reactions) are caused by replicating virus. Therefore, efforts are underway to develop safer, inactivated vaccines. A whole-virion inactivated vaccine adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was protective in animal models and was shown to be well tolerated and immunogenic in a phase I clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune globulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no specific yellow fever <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> product available. Immune globulin produced in the United States (where many military personnel have been vaccinated) may contain yellow fever-neutralizing antibodies. Passive immunization has been used off label to protect persons traveling to high-risk areas who have contraindications to vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. If exposure to yellow fever virus occurred at a defined time (eg, in the case of accidental exposure in the laboratory or to blood from an acutely ill patient), postexposure treatment with immune globulin (from United States donors) or interferon-alfa (preferably not longer-acting pegylated interferon) would be warranted. Treatment would be expected to be effective only within the first 24 hours after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne viral hemorrhagic fever with a high case-fatality rate. Travelers to tropical regions of South America and sub-Saharan Africa are at risk for acquisition of infection and require immunization. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mosquito-borne epidemics in Africa occur where human populations reside in high density and immunization coverage is low (so-called &quot;urban yellow fever&quot;). Fewer cases occur in South America than in Africa because transmission occurs principally from monkey to human via mosquito vectors, the vector density is relatively low, and vaccination coverage is relatively high (so-called &quot;jungle yellow fever&quot;). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yellow fever is characterized by three stages: periods of infection, remission, and intoxication. The period of infection consists of viremia with nonspecific symptoms and signs including fever, malaise, headache, joint pain, nausea, and vomiting. This is followed by a period of remission with abatement of fever and symptoms lasting up to 48 hours. The subsequent period of intoxication is characterized by hepatic dysfunction, renal failure, coagulopathy, and shock. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis may be made by serology, by detection of viral genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in serum, by virus isolation, or by histopathology and immunocytochemistry (postmortem samples only). Serologic diagnosis is best accomplished using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM. The presence of IgM antibodies in a single sample provides a presumptive diagnosis; confirmation is made by a rise in titer between paired acute and convalescent samples or a fall between early and late convalescent samples. More specific neutralization tests may be performed but require a specialized laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of yellow fever consists of supportive care; there is no specific antiviral therapy available. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In accordance with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and the World Health Organization (WHO), we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=yellow-fever-vaccine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">yellow fever vaccine</a> for travelers to yellow fever-endemic areas of Africa and South America and for residents of those areas (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). The vaccine may be administered to individuals over the age of nine months. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Whom to vaccinate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious adverse reactions to the 17D vaccine are very rare; they include two syndromes, yellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease (YEL-AND) and yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD). In the United States, the risks of YEL-AND and YEL-AVD in civilian travelers are estimated at 0.8 and 0.4 per 100,000, respectively, although the risk is higher in older adults, persons with immune dysregulation, and possibly young females. Serious adverse events have been significantly less frequently observed during immunization campaigns in endemic countries. In an ongoing epidemic in Angola, multiple cases of yellow fever have been exported to various countries, including China. This illustrates the danger of travel to endemic regions without vaccination and the risk of global spread of the virus. (See <a href=\"#H4021643727\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some countries in yellow fever-endemic zones require an international certificate of vaccination as evidence of yellow fever immunization prior to entry. In addition, some countries outside of yellow fever zones also require evidence of immunizations prior to entry for individuals with recent travel in endemic countries. The international certificate of immunization is valid for 10 years; a booster 0.5 mL dose is required every 10 years for the certificate to be reissued. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Immunization certificates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunity after a single dose is long lasting. In May 2014, the World Health Assembly adopted the recommendation to remove the 10-year booster dose requirement from the International Health Regulations by June 2016. Until this time, travelers to countries with a yellow fever vaccination entry requirement must have received a dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=yellow-fever-vaccine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">yellow fever vaccine</a> within the past 10 years. In June 2015, the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued recommendations stating that a single primary dose of yellow fever vaccine is adequate for most travelers; the ACIP does recommend additional doses of yellow fever vaccine at-risk laboratory personnel and certain travelers. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Whom to vaccinate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractional dosing is a strategy for extending <a href=\"topic.htm?path=yellow-fever-vaccine-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">yellow fever vaccine</a> supply in outbreak situations. In 2016, the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization stated that vaccination with one-fifth the standard dose is sufficient to provide protection against yellow fever for at least 12 months, and they advocated short-term use of this approach among individuals &ge;2 years in emergency conditions when vaccine supplies are limited. (See <a href=\"#H759184017\" class=\"local\">'Fractional vaccine dosing in outbreaks'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yellow-fever/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mutebi JP, Wang H, Li L, et al.
