Although the association may be diminished or prevented by concomitant use of inhaled glucocorticoids, the data are not definitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

However, this increased risk was not seen in children and adolescents who also received inhaled glucocorticoids as an assigned study treatment. Conclusions regarding the protective effect of inhaled glucocorticoids are limited by the small number of patient events in this subgroup. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the impact of LABA (either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">formoterol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a>), taken for at least 12 weeks, on asthma-related total morbidity and mortality among patients concomitantly using inhaled glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, ACPJC, and Cochrane (Central) databases yielded 62 relevant blinded, randomized trials with over 29,000 participants (15,710 taking LABA and over 8000 patient-years observed in the LABA groups). Three asthma-related deaths and two asthma-related, nonfatal intubations (all in LABA groups; &le;1 event per study) occurred. The OR for total mortality was 1.26 (95% CI 0.58-2.74), reflecting 14 deaths in LABA groups and eight deaths in control groups, respectively. Differences in asthma-related hospitalizations (OR, 0.74; 95% CI 0.53-1.03) and asthma-related serious adverse events (mostly hospitalizations; OR, 0.75; 95% CI 0.54-1.03) failed to reach statistical significance. There were very few asthma-related deaths and intubations, and events were too infrequent to establish LABA's relative effect on these outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 66 trials (20,966 participants) comparing the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-and-salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone-salmeterol</a> with inhaled glucocorticoid alone found that combination therapy was associated with a decrease in the risk of severe exacerbation, no change in the risk of hospitalization, and no apparent increase in the risk of intubation or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The adjusted death rate among patients taking formoterol was not significantly increased (RR 2.68; 95% CI 0.53-13.5), although the confidence intervals were broad. Formoterol was associated with a significant reduction in asthma-related nonfatal severe adverse events. No increase in the rate of serious adverse events was noted with increasing doses of formoterol. Despite the size of the combined study population, the meta-analysis did not have the power to conclude absolutely that formoterol is not associated with an increase in mortality risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial, more than 25,000 patients with asthma were assigned to receive the long-acting beta agonist, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a>, or the short-acting beta agonist, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There was a nonstatistically significant three-fold increased likelihood of death among patients that received salmeterol (12 of 16,787) compared to patients that received albuterol (2 of 8393). Interpretation of the study was limited by bias due to higher withdrawal from the albuterol group and by inability to evaluate subgroups that did or did not receive inhaled glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Salmeterol</a> Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART) was a randomized trial in which 26,355 patients with asthma were assigned to receive salmeterol or placebo for 28 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Salmeterol use was associated with increased respiratory-related death (relative risk 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.4), asthma-related death (relative risk 4.4, 95% CI 1.2-15.3), and combined asthma-related death or life-threatening experience (relative risk 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-2.9). Subgroup analysis suggested that the risk might be greater in African Americans. Like the trial above, SMART was not designed to evaluate subgroups that did or did not receive inhaled glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p>The interpretation of these and other data is complicated, particularly regarding the impact of concurrent inhaled glucocorticoids. Many experts believe that inhaled glucocorticoids diminish or prevent the potential risk of long-acting beta agonists, while others believe the data are insufficient to warrant this conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. However, despite these potential risks in small numbers of patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a> in combination with inhaled glucocorticoids significantly reduces exacerbation rates in the majority of adults. Thus, as with all medications, the proper balance between risk and benefit with combination therapy should be individually evaluated and prospectively monitored over time.

In a meta-analysis of 22 studies (8032 participants), an increase in serious adverse events (SAEs) was noted when regular use of formoterol was compared with placebo (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.31), but not when compared with regular use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Overall, nonfatal SAEs were rare, occurring in 1 percent of patients on placebo. Too few asthma-related deaths were reported to assess drug-related mortality. </p><p>The effect of combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">formoterol</a> PLUS inhaled glucocorticoids is discussed below.

These data, along with the results observed in the SMART trial described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], in which many patients were receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a> monotherapy and experienced adverse outcomes, strongly indicate that LABAs should not be used as monotherapy.

This uncertainty is related to results of studies in which the LABA and inhaled glucocorticoid were administered using separate inhaler devices as opposed to fixed dose combination inhalers that contain both in one device. Thus, additional research is needed to resolve the questions whether LABA therapy is associated with an increased risk of severe or fatal asthma exacerbations and whether associated inhaled glucocorticoid therapy is fully protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/14,16,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,31,32</a>]. Unfortunately, the formidable sample size that would be required makes it highly unlikely that such a trial will be possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/18,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,33</a>].

Based on the review, the FDA removed the &quot;boxed warning&quot; on combination LABA-inhaled glucocorticoid medications. The &quot;boxed warning&quot; had been in place since the 2010 FDA Drug Safety Communication of concerns about an increased risk of severe exacerbation of asthma leading to hospitalization or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

In addition, the FDA advises that LABAs should only be used as additional therapy for patients whose asthma is not adequately controlled despite use of a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled glucocorticoid. Once asthma control is achieved and maintained, step-down therapy with discontinuation of the LABA is advised, if that is possible without loss of asthma control. However, a systematic review regarding the wisdom of discontinuing LABAs in patients on combination therapy found that stopping LABA slightly reduced asthma control and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3905123\"><span class=\"h3\">National and international guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on a thorough review of the literature regarding safety and efficacy of long acting beta agonists, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) expert panel recommended various options for Step 3 care in both children and adults with asthma whose disease was not well controlled on low doses of inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One choice consisted of the addition of a LABA, the other choice an increase in the inhaled glucocorticoid dose to the medium range. Following the release of the 2010 FDA advisory statement outlined above, members of the NAEPP expert panel did not feel that any data generated from the time of their report in 2007 to the release of the 2010 FDA advisory statement would change the 2007 recommendations or the interpretation of the data that led to them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

In theory, the inhaled glucocorticoid should suppress the underlying inflammatory response while the chronic beta agonist provides enough symptom control to permit lower doses of the inhaled glucocorticoid to be used, thus reducing glucocorticoid-related adverse effects. Herein, &quot;combination therapy&quot; refers inhaled glucocorticoids plus long-acting inhaled beta agonist. We follow the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program expert panel report III regarding the specific indications for adding a LABA for the treatment of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/1,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37</a>].

As an example, one treatment may be better at improving pulmonary function, while both may be equally good at controlling exacerbations. Thus, the choice of therapy may depend on which outcome needs greater control in an individual patient. In addition, the patient's current medication regimen should be considered (eg, receiving or not receiving controller medications).</p><p>In glucocorticoid na&iuml;ve patients with mild airway obstruction, the initiation of combination therapy does not reduce the rate of exacerbations compared to initiation of inhaled glucocorticoids alone. Combination therapy does improve lung function and symptom-free days, but does not reduce use of short-acting inhaled beta agonists as a rescue medication compared to inhaled glucocorticoids alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beta-agonists-in-asthma-controversy-regarding-chronic-use/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].
