Other patients have fewer and less obvious clinical signs but definite biochemical hyperthyroidism. Still others have little or no clinical hyperthyroidism, and their only biochemical abnormality is a low serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration, a disorder called subclinical hyperthyroidism.</p><p>Following a brief discussion of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism, the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with hyperthyroidism will be presented here. An overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism, disorders that cause hyperthyroidism, the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, and subclinical hyperthyroidism are discussed in detail separately.

Isolated symptoms and signs that should lead to evaluation for hyperthyroidism in patients of any age include unexplained weight loss, new onset atrial fibrillation, myopathy, menstrual disorders, and gynecomastia.</p><p>Other conditions that should suggest the possibility of hyperthyroidism include osteoporosis, hypercalcemia, heart failure, premature atrial contractions, shortness of breath, and a deterioration in glycemic control in patients with previously diagnosed diabetes.

They also tend to have more weight loss and less of an increase in appetite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most dramatic example of this phenomenon is &quot;apathetic thyrotoxicosis,&quot; in which older patients have no symptoms except for weakness and asthenia.

Many patients have stare (lid retraction) and lid lag, representing sympathetic hyperactivity. The skin is typically warm and moist, and the hair may be thin and fine. Tachycardia is common, the pulse is irregularly irregular in patients with atrial fibrillation, systolic hypertension may be present, and the precordium is often hyperdynamic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The serum TSH concentration alone cannot determine the degree of biochemical hyperthyroidism; serum free T4 and T3 are required to provide this information. However, in laboratories utilizing serum TSH assays with detection limits of 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> (third generation), most patients with overt hyperthyroidism have values &lt;0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many patients with overt hyperthyroidism have high free T4 and T3 concentrations. In some patients, however, only the serum T3 or serum T4 is elevated. In patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH is below normal (but usually &gt;0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> and serum free T4, T3, and free T3 are normal.

As an example, patients with hyperthyroidism tend to have low serum total, low-density (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, which increase after treatment. In addition, the red blood cell mass may be increased in hyperthyroidism, but the plasma volume is increased more, resulting in a normochromic, normocytic anemia. Serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin concentrations may be high, indicative of increased bone turnover.

In patients in whom there is a clinical suspicion of hyperthyroidism, the best initial test is serum TSH. If the value is normal, the patient is very unlikely to have primary hyperthyroidism. Many laboratories have instituted algorithms in which serum free T4 and T3 are automatically measured if a low serum TSH value is obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If a laboratory is unable to add these determinations to a low TSH value and it will be inconvenient for the patient to return for follow-up testing, it is reasonable to order serum TSH, free T4, and T3 as initial tests in patients in whom the clinical suspicion of hyperthyroidism is high. In addition, if hyperthyroidism is strongly suspected despite a normal or elevated serum TSH value, serum free T4 and T3 should be measured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16195383\"><span class=\"h2\">Overt hyperthyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of overt hyperthyroidism is usually straightforward. Except for laboratory error, all patients with low serum TSH and high free T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T3 concentrations have primary hyperthyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16194933\"><span class=\"h2\">T3-toxicosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with overt hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease or nodular goiter have greater increases in serum T3 than in serum T4, due both to a disproportionate increase in thyroidal T3 secretion and increased extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Patients with T3-toxicosis by definition have symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism but only high serum T3 (and low TSH) concentrations. An occasional patient will have normal serum T3 and free T4 levels but will have an elevated serum free T3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This pattern of test results tends to occur early in the course of hyperthyroidism, a time at which most patients have relatively few symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16194990\"><span class=\"h2\">T4-toxicosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pattern of low TSH, high serum free T4, and normal T3 concentrations is called T4-toxicosis. It may be found in patients with hyperthyroidism who have a concurrent nonthyroidal illness that decreases extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Despite the nonthyroidal illness, these patients remain hyperthyroid and their serum TSH concentrations are low; with recovery from the nonthyroidal illness, serum T3 concentrations rise unless the hyperthyroidism is recognized and treated.

Thus, patients with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism may also have T4-hyperthyroidism (or at least have serum T3 concentrations that are not as elevated as in patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism). This pattern is present whether the hyperthyroidism is caused by amiodarone-induced thyroiditis or iodide excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Most of these patients have no clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism, and those symptoms that are present are mild and nonspecific. Many patients have a multinodular goiter with autonomy (toxic nodular goiter) or mild Graves' disease. Most patients are detected through routine screening of thyroid function.

Serum T4 and even free T4 concentrations may be normal because of decreased protein-binding of T4, caused by either low serum concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, displacement of T4 from binding proteins by endogenous metabolites or drugs, and other factors. Similar results (low-normal serum T4, normal or low serum T3, and low serum TSH concentrations) are found in euthyroid patients in intensive care units. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid function in nonthyroidal illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since critically ill hyperthyroid patients and many euthyroid critically ill patients have low serum TSH concentrations, identification of those that are hyperthyroid may be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The nonthyroidal illness may overshadow or mimic hyperthyroidism (by causing tachycardia, tremor, weakness). Since many critically ill patients have low serum T4 and T3 concentrations, a serum T4 value well within the normal range suggests the possible presence of hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis is further supported by very low serum TSH values, eg, less than 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span>. In contrast, detectable but subnormal TSH values (eg, TSH 0.1 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> in an assay with a detection limit of 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> are more consistent with nonthyroidal illness alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>In critically ill patients with suspected hyperthyroidism (TSH &lt;0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> and normal serum T4), antithyroid drug therapy should be instituted, with a plan for reassessment after recovery from the nonthyroidal illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16194820\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several situations in which the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism may be missed or incorrectly suspected:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of hyperthyroidism may be incorrectly suspected in patients who have one of several abnormalities in serum thyroid hormone-binding proteins that result in high serum total (and sometimes free) T4 concentrations and normal (or slightly high) T3 concentrations.

We typically measure TRAb first. If the antibodies are positive, it confirms the diagnosis of Graves' disease. If negative, it does not distinguish among the etiologies, as TRAb may not be elevated in patients with mild Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In this setting, we proceed with a radioactive iodine uptake. An alternative is to assess thyroidal blood flow on ultrasound in those centers where expertise is available.

The physical examination may be notable for hyperactivity and rapid speech. The presence and size of a goiter depends upon the cause of the hyperthyroidism. Exophthalmos, periorbital and conjunctival edema, limitation of eye movement, and infiltrative dermopathy (pretibial myxedema) occur only in patients with Graves' disease. (See <a href=\"#H25975024\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with primary hyperthyroidism have a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Many patients with overt hyperthyroidism have high free thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. In some patients, however, only the serum T3 or serum T4 is elevated. In patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism, TSH is below normal (but usually &gt;0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> and serum free T4, T3, and free T3 are normal. Both overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism are biochemical definitions since hyperthyroid symptoms are nonspecific and may be present in patients with subclinical disease and absent in those with overt disease, especially older adults. (See <a href=\"#H16195540\" class=\"local\">'Thyroid function tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients in whom hyperthyroidism is suspected, serum TSH is the best initial test. If subnormal, serum free T4 and T3 concentrations are run by most laboratories. If serum free T4 and T3 are not automatically measured when a low serum TSH value is obtained but the index of suspicion for hyperthyroidism is high, a free T4 and T3 should be ordered with the initial TSH measurement.

The diagnosis may be obvious on presentation; a patient with new-onset ophthalmopathy, a large non-nodular thyroid, and moderate to severe hyperthyroidism has Graves' disease. However, if the diagnosis is not apparent based on the clinical presentation, diagnostic testing is indicated and can include, depending on available expertise and resources, measurement of thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb, also called TSI, TBII, or TBI), determination of the radioactive iodine uptake, or measurement of thyroidal blood flow on ultrasonography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76972 \">table 1</a>).
