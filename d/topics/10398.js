This point should be emphasized to the patient who is likely to have many fears and anxieties regarding the risks. Nonetheless, women with epilepsy are at increased risk for a range of perinatal complications compared with the general population, including preeclampsia, preterm labor, and fetal and maternal mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is important for physicians and women with epilepsy to be aware of these as careful planning and management of pregnancy can increase the odds of a favorable outcome.</p><p>There are a number of important issues to be addressed by the physician when a woman with epilepsy becomes pregnant; these include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are antiseizure drugs necessary?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What effect do antiseizure drugs have on the fetus?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What effect does maternal epilepsy have on the fetus?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What effect does pregnancy have on seizures?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How should the patient be managed during pregnancy and delivery?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How should the patient be managed during the postpartum period?</p><p/><p>This topic will discuss the management of pregnancy and epilepsy.

Over 90 percent of women with epilepsy will have good outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Preconception counseling is important for all women of child bearing years because many pregnancies are unplanned and the risks of complications can be minimized by interventions before and early on in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; in addition, many women with epilepsy report limited knowledge about key issues and unmet informational needs regarding pregnancy and childbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

A higher dose (4 mg daily) is suggested in women considered to be at increased risk of neural tube defects (eg, previous child with a neural tube defect, those taking antiseizure drugs, especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Low serum folate levels in women with epilepsy are independently associated with an increased risk of major fetal malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It has not yet been conclusively determined if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation prevents neural tube defects in women receiving antiseizure drugs. However, animal studies have shown that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> decrease the concentration of certain forms of folate and are associated with neural tube defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. A limited number of observational studies in women with epilepsy have failed to demonstrate a reduction in the risk of neural tube defects with preconceptual use of folic acid compared with folic acid supplementation beginning later in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Published clinical guidelines regarding the dose of folate supplementation in women with epilepsy vary and are not definitive. The 2009 American Academy of Neurology and American Epilepsy Society guidelines state that data are insufficient to determine whether doses higher than 0.4 mg offer greater protective benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends 4 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> daily for women at risk of having offspring with neural tube defects (including women taking antiseizure drugs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The higher dose of folic acid has not been associated with adverse effects.</p><p>In the absence of randomized clinical trial evidence in women taking antiseizure drugs, and extrapolating from other high risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], we suggest that women with epilepsy on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> who are planning to become pregnant should receive daily high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation (4 mg) for one to three months prior to conception and throughout the first trimester in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. If possible, valproate should be avoided in pregnancy.

In some patients, routine EEG recordings or continuous <span class=\"nowrap\">video/EEG</span> monitoring may be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient require antiseizure drugs and if so, is she on the most appropriate medication(s) and at the minimum dose to maintain seizure control?</p><p/><p>The frequency of seizure recurrence within six and twelve months of discontinuing therapy is approximately 15 and 30 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The risk may vary according to the specific epilepsy syndrome and other factors, however, and these estimates should be individualized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Discontinuing antiseizure drug therapy'</a>.)</p><p>If a woman has been seizure-free for a satisfactory period and the decision is made to discontinue antiseizure drugs, we suggest doing so at least six to twelve months prior to becoming pregnant, as the risk of seizure recurrence after withdrawal is highest during this period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of antiseizure drug</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If it is felt that medications cannot be withdrawn, the patient should take the most suitable medication for the seizure type, with the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, which should be avoided whenever possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal treatment of women with epilepsy who are of childbearing age is unclear because of a lack of conclusive data on the comparative teratogenicity of different antiseizure drugs. A number of pregnancy registries are beginning to accumulate data that should help guide therapy in the coming years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks associated with epilepsy and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Effect of antiseizure drugs on the fetus'</a>.)</p><p>Data on the comparative efficacy of various antiseizure drugs for controlling seizures during pregnancy are also quite limited, and there are no randomized trials in this setting. Most pregnancy registry studies collect only crude information on seizure outcomes, or none at all. In an Australian registry study that included over 1000 pregnancies in women with epilepsy treated with antiseizure drug monotherapy, seizure control was better among women treated with &quot;older&quot; antiseizure drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, valproic acid) compared with &quot;newer&quot; antiseizure drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a> (35 versus 48 percent of pregnancies affected by at least one seizure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among the &quot;newer&quot; antiseizure drugs, levetiracetam was associated with fewer seizure-affected pregnancies than lamotrigine (32 versus 51 percent), although the number of levetiracetam-exposed pregnancies was relatively small (n = 82). One other large registry study also observed that lamotrigine was associated with worse seizure control compared with other antiseizure drugs despite a mean dose increase of 26 percent from the first to third trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Lamotrigine clearance is known to increase two- to threefold during pregnancy, and close monitoring of clinical status and drug levels is indicated in women treated with lamotrigine as well as other antiseizure drugs. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Drug levels and dose adjustment'</a> below.)</p><p>At present, we recommend the following approach. Antiseizure drug therapy should be optimized prior to conception, if possible, before exposure of the fetus to potential teratogenic effects of antiseizure drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Since there is no agreement as to which antiseizure drug is most or least teratogenic, the antiseizure drug that stops seizures in a given patient is the one that should be used.</p><p>An exception is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>. Results from pregnancy registries and cohort studies suggest higher teratogenicity and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes with valproate than with other antiseizure drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Also, while concentrations of most antiseizure drugs are generally lower in umbilical compared with maternal serum, valproate is associated with higher umbilical than maternal concentrations, perhaps because of increased placental transfer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The risks associated with in utero exposure to valproate and other antiseizure drugs are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks associated with epilepsy and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Long-term effects'</a>.)</p><p>For these reasons, we generally avoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> in women planning to become pregnant if seizures can be adequately controlled with other antiseizure drugs. If valproate is used, it should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose.

Preconception counseling may play a role in minimizing this risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is important to emphasize the importance of adequate sleep, medical compliance, and minimizing stress and other factors known to precipitate seizures.</p><p>In a study that included 95 women with epilepsy followed at a single tertiary care epilepsy clinic, 38 percent of pregnancies were associated with increased seizure frequency compared with the pre-pregnancy baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The risk of worsened seizure frequency was highest in those with seizures in the 12 months prior to conception and in those with focal epilepsy.</p><p>Although the mechanisms are not yet clear, there appears to be a significant increase in the risk of maternal mortality around the time of delivery in women with epilepsy, along with a more modest increase in the risk of a range of obstetric complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This highlights the importance of close intrapartum care and the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these risks, so that preventive interventions can be devised.

While at least one retrospective study found that serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> levels of mothers of malformed offspring were significant lower than those of mothers of normal offspring during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], no prospective studies have been performed to evaluate whether monitoring levels during pregnancy improves outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for malformations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for major anomalies provides the patient with the opportunity to terminate the pregnancy if a malformation is present. Even if the patient would not consider termination, it may be helpful to know if a major defect is present in order to plan the optimum mode of delivery and to refer the patient to a center with specialty pediatric services for delivery. There are two major screening modalities: serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration and ultrasonography:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated serum AFP is associated with neural tube defects and other fetal abnormalities (eg ventral wall defects, congenital nephrosis). Measurement of the serum AFP concentration or amniocentesis for alpha-fetoprotein should be performed between 14 and 16 weeks, especially in women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Amniocentesis is associated with a 0.5 percent risk of miscarriage.

The detection rate increases to 94 to 100 percent if the serum level is measured in combination with high-resolution ultrasonography by an experienced ultrasonographer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The highest degree of accuracy is obtained by using amniocentesis for determination of amniotic fluid AFP and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). If both levels are elevated, there is greater than a 99 percent chance of an open neural tube defect.

First, most case reports occurred in an era when polytherapy was more prevalent and regular monitoring of drug levels less common; higher drug levels may increase bleeding risk. In addition, use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> was more common in the past, while most patients in this study were on monotherapy and took <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>. Finally, the incidence of birth trauma may be lower with the current increase in cesarean section rates worldwide.</p><p>Regardless of the reasons for the discrepancy, these findings suggest that antenatal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> prophylaxis may not be necessary in all women on antiseizure drugs. On the other hand, oral vitamin K is relatively cheap and harmless.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Necessity for antiseizure drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because there are no clear data indicating that any drug is without risk in pregnancy, we suggest that patients planning pregnancy should be managed on the most effective antiseizure drug for their seizures (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). As an exception, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> should be avoided if an alternate effective antiseizure drug regimen can be found (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Monotherapy and the lowest possible drug dose may limit risk of teratogenicity. The antiseizure drug regimen should be optimized six months prior to planned conception. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Choice of antiseizure drug'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest NOT making changes to antiseizure drug regimen for the purpose of reducing teratogenic risk in established pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
