The etiology, diagnosis, and complications of PROM in this period, which can loosely be defined as &lt;23 weeks of gestation, will be reviewed here. The management of preterm PROM later in gestation is discussed separately.

Multiple etiologies are probably involved and operate along various pathways involving both mechanical and nonmechanical factors. It is likely these pathways lead to a final common pathway that culminates in membrane rupture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spontaneous preterm birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for PROM before or at the limit of viability are similar to those for preterm labor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68992 \">table 1</a>). The major risk factors appear to be a prior history of preterm labor, PROM before or at the limit of viability, or cervical insufficiency, or a current pregnancy complicated by multiple gestation or antepartum bleeding. It is likely that both PROM before or at the limit of viability and preterm labor are expressions of a more general process of intrauterine inflammation and thus share many antecedents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Interestingly, evidence is accumulating to suggest that aberrant trophoblastic development in the late first trimester, a pathology more traditionally associated with preeclampsia, may be associated with up to half of the cases of membrane rupture in this gestational interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">After invasive procedures</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Amniocentesis</strong> --Diagnostic amniocentesis is the most common procedure associated with PROM before or at the limit of viability, which occurs in about 1 percent of procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In contrast to spontaneous PROM before or at the limit of viability, leakage of amniotic fluid shortly after amniocentesis is usually not associated with adverse outcome because the membranes typically &quot;reseal.&quot; Possible reasons resealing after amniocentesis is more likely than after spontaneous rupture are that the rupture site is very small, not proximate to the cervix, and composed of otherwise healthy fetal membranes. (See <a href=\"#H940726278\" class=\"local\">'Resealing and reaccumulation of fluid'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-amniocentesis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic amniocentesis&quot;, section on 'Leakage of amniotic fluid'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fetoscopy, fetal surgery, and percutaneous umbilical vein blood sampling</strong> -- These procedures are more likely to cause PROM before or at the limit of viability than amniocentesis. The risk is highest with fetal surgery and fetoscopy. In the latter case, clinical experience suggests that the risk is related to the number and diameter of ports and the duration of manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Single port operative procedures are associated with a 6 to 10 percent incidence of membrane rupture; the risk is lower for diagnostic procedures, but much higher (20 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]) for operative procedures involving two or more ports and long operating times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cerclage</strong> -- Rupture of membranes at or after physical examination-, ultrasound-, or history-indicated cerclage placement is rare, but has a poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Cessation of leakage is probably not due to actual repair and regeneration of the membranes, but rather to changes in the decidua and myometrium that block further leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This subgroup of pregnancies has outcomes comparable to pregnancies uncomplicated by amniorrhexis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>A second subset of patients continue to leak fluid, but have partial reaccumulation of amniotic fluid. Approximately 25 percent of patients with PROM before or at the limit of viability reaccumulate fluid on ultrasound examination during expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>As noted above, patients with iatrogenic PROM before or at the limit of viability after amniocentesis usually reseal membranes within a week and have good pregnancy outcomes. The relatively discrete and focal nature of the iatrogenic membrane disruption when compared with the more ragged and larger defect that occurs with spontaneous membrane rupture likely contributes to these differences in resealing rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-amniocentesis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic amniocentesis&quot;, section on 'Leakage of amniotic fluid'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2843497413\"><span class=\"h2\">Latency/preterm birth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The time interval between membrane rupture and delivery is a critical factor in determining outcome in PROM before or at the limit of viability. In the author&rsquo;s review of studies in which the weighted mean gestational age at PROM was 23.5 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/11,12,15-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,15-26</a>], the weighted mean latency from gestational age at PROM before or at the limit of viability to delivery was 17 days and the weighted median latency was 6.8 days.</p><p>The large difference between mean and median latency is because the majority of pregnancies complicated by PROM before or at the limit of viability deliver soon after presentation; fewer than 50 percent of patients remain pregnant beyond the first week after rupture. By 28 days post-rupture, 73 to 88 percent of pregnancies complicated by PROM before or at the limit of viability have delivered. However, for pregnancies not delivering within the first 24 hours, the mean latency is 10 to 14 days.</p><p>Several authors have suggested that there is an inverse relationship between latency and gestational age at rupture: Ruptures occurring earlier in gestation appear to have longer latencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/15,18,20,22-24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,20,22-24,27</a>]. This inverse relationship may represent &quot;right censoring&quot;; patients who deliver shortly after arriving on the labor floor are often excluded from latency studies and thus these studies may exclude patients more likely to be at an advanced gestational age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS AND OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy complications associated with PROM before or at the limit of viability include preterm birth, maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> infection, abruptio placentae, umbilical cord prolapse, <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> deformation, fetal or neonatal death, retained placenta, and need for classical cesarean delivery. </p><p>Counseling the patient with PROM before or at the limit of viability about pregnancy complications and pediatric outcome is challenging because of the small size, different gestational age ranges, and retrospective nature of the multiple studies on this subject. The majority of these reports refer to a single institutional experience, frequently prior to the widespread use of antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis, antepartum glucocorticoids to accelerate fetal lung maturation, and neonatal surfactant therapy. In addition, these studies often have differing <span class=\"nowrap\">inclusion/exclusion</span> and diagnostic criteria and limited ability to adjust for confounders. Despite these limitations, the body of data provides remarkably consistent conclusions and estimates of the magnitude of risk with expectant management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Chorioamnionitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorioamnionitis complicates approximately 30 to 40 percent of PROM before or at the limit of viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/16,20,21,23,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20,21,23,28-30</a>]. It is more common in pregnancies with PROM before or at the limit of viability than in pregnancies without PROM delivering at a similar gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/12,24,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,24,31</a>], or in pregnancies with PROM occurring later in gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. </p><p>Chorioamnionitis can be a cause or a result of PROM before or at the limit of viability. It may cause PROM because infection of intact membranes weakens them, thereby facilitating rupture; it can be a sequelae of PROM because ruptured membranes are less effective as a barrier to transcervical migration of cervicovaginal flora. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spontaneous preterm birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While subclinical chorioamnionitis may be present prior to membrane rupture, it typically becomes clinically apparent early in the latency period; more than one-half of cases occur within the first seven days after rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/11,17,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17,18,21</a>]. The maximum clinical occurrence is on the second through fifth day after rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/11,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,34</a>]. After the first week of latency, the incidence of clinical chorioamnionitis falls dramatically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/11,18,20,21,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18,20,21,35,36</a>]. The higher frequency of clinical chorioamnionitis early in the latency period suggests that subclinical infection was likely present prior to membrane rupture, and may have been the cause.</p><p>Clinically evident chorioamnionitis is associated with onset of preterm labor and delivery, thus it is a major cause of shortened latency. The risk of developing chorioamnionitis after PROM before or at the limit of viability is increased in women with very low residual amniotic fluid volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and those who undergo digital cervical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The observation that the incidence of chorioamnionitis falls with prolonged latency implies that intrauterine infection may play a smaller role in precipitating delivery in the longer latency pregnancies than in pregnancies that deliver shortly after membrane rupture. This observation has been corroborated by a report that noted that the frequency of inflammatory pathology observed on neonatal head ultrasounds was lower after a longer latency than after a shorter latency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Chorioamnionitis can also lead to maternal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], but this is unusual with appropriate intervention (eg, antibiotic therapy and delivery). Maternal sepsis complicates approximately 5 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(5/104)</span> of pregnancies with PROM between 20 and 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and 1.2 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(2/174)</span> of pregnancies with PROM between 14 and 23 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Placental abruption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abruptio placenta is more common in pregnancies with PROM before or at the limit of viability than in the general obstetric population, 2 to 44 percent versus 0.4 to 1.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Among pregnancies with PROM before or at the limit of viability , the risk of abruption correlates inversely with gestational age at rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/23,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,39</a>]. As an example, the incidence of abruption was 40 to 50 percent in PROM prior to 20 weeks in two studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/23,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,39</a>] and 17 percent in a study of PROM between 20 and 24 weeks in third study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental abruption: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic abruption is likely one cause of PROM before or at the limit of viability. There is abundant evidence that thrombin enhances fetal membrane <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decidual cytokine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protease production, which could exacerbate membrane damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>]. Abruption-associated thrombin also appears to decrease expression of decidual cell progesterone receptor, which promotes preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

A review of nine studies including 731 patients with PROM before or at the limit of viability reported a 1.9 percent incidence of cord prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In a series of 93 pregnancies with PROM at 15 to 24 weeks, 27 percent underwent a pregnancy termination; of the remaining pregnancies, fetal demise occurred in 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The limit of viability is defined as the stage of fetal maturity that ensures a reasonable chance of survival. Determining the limit of viability is desirable so that costly and painful interventions can be avoided if the neonate does not have a chance of survival. However, deciding upon a threshold of viability is challenging because it remains uncertain which extremely preterm newborn has a reasonable chance of survival.

These women are admitted to the hospital for usual management of PROM at the gestational age when they would want aggressive neonatal intervention. A common practice among neonatologists is to not offer or provide neonatal resuscitation to neonates &lt;22 weeks of gestation due to the zero or near-zero chance of survival. Likewise, between 22 and 23 or 24 weeks, it is also a common practice among neonatologists to offer neonatal resuscitation to parents if there is at least a small chance of survival based on available information and provide or withhold resuscitation based on the preference of informed parents.

The author feels strongly, as is implied in the joint statement, that the decision to administer prophylactic glucocorticoids at this margin of viability should be independent of the intention to provide emergency cesarean delivery. By the 23<sup>rd</sup> week of gestation, he routinely provides emergency cesarean delivery intervention for standard obstetric indications. Parents should be informed that antenatal glucocorticoids may provide a survival benefit while increasing the risk of survival with severe impairment. Also, if the pregnancy is not delivered, then a single repeat course of antenatal corticosteroids may be needed later in gestation.

A case series of 213 pregnancies with PROM &lt;23 weeks suggests that antibiotic therapy was associated with longer latency and improved neonatal outcomes.

It may be spontaneous or a complication of an invasive obstetrical procedure. PROM before or at the limit of viability after amniocentesis has a much better prognosis than spontaneous PROM before or at the limit of viability because membranes often reseal after amniocentesis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Causes and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The time interval between membrane rupture and delivery is a critical factor in determining outcome. The mean latency from gestational age at PROM to delivery is about 17 days and the median latency is about one week, since the majority of pregnancies deliver soon after rupture of membranes. (See <a href=\"#H2843497413\" class=\"local\">'Latency/preterm birth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal survival is primarily related to gestational age at delivery, and is comparable to that in preterm deliveries matched for gestational age without PROM before or at the limit of viability. For these very early gestations, gains in fetal maturity with expectant management dramatically improve survival. (See <a href=\"#H546701053\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal death'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy complications associated with PROM before or at the limit of viability include increased risks of infection (chorioamnionitis, endometritis), abruptio placentae, cord prolapse, fetal death, preterm birth, and need for cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy complications and outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neonate is at risk for <span class=\"nowrap\">morbidity/mortality</span> related to preterm birth, infection, pulmonary hypoplasia, and musculoskeletal deformation. (See <a href=\"#H546700680\" class=\"local\">'Pediatric outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cessation of amniotic fluid leakage with reaccumulation of amniotic fluid confers a prognosis comparable to that of pregnancies without previable PROM. (See <a href=\"#H940726278\" class=\"local\">'Resealing and reaccumulation of fluid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend antenatal glucocorticoids at &ge;23 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). A course of glucocorticoids in the 22<sup>nd</sup> week is reasonable if delivery at 23 weeks is anticipated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The safety and efficacy of tissue sealants for repair of PROM have not been established.

Most women at this gestational age who are stable and choose to continue their pregnancies are not admitted to the hospital and not given antenatal corticosteroids, tocolytics, or prophylactic antibiotics, but we obtain a rectovaginal group B streptococcus culture. They are admitted to the hospital for usual management of PROM at the gestational age when they would want aggressive neonatal intervention. (See <a href=\"#H546709479\" class=\"local\">'Previable pregnancy at membrane rupture'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pregnancies at the limit of viability at membrane rupture</strong> &ndash; Management of these pregnancies depends on patient-specific factors and preferences. These women are admitted to the hospital for usual management of PROM at the gestational age when they would want aggressive neonatal intervention. Between 22 and 23 or 24 weeks, a common practice among neonatologists is to offer neonatal resuscitation to parents if there is at least a small chance of survival based on available information and provide or withhold resuscitation based on the preference of informed parents. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">We routinely administer a full course of antenatal corticosteroids to pregnancies at &ge;23 weeks of gestation and offer corticosteroid therapy in the mid-22<sup>nd</sup> week. By the 23<sup>rd</sup> week of gestation, we routinely provide emergent cesarean delivery intervention for standard obstetric indications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Parents should be informed that antenatal corticosteroids may provide a survival benefit while increasing the risk of survival with severe impairment. Also, if the pregnancy is not delivered, then a single repeat course of antenatal corticosteroids may be needed later in gestation.
