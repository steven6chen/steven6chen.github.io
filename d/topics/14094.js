In women with preexisting (chronic) hypertension, accelerating hypertension plus proteinuria, end-organ dysfunction, or both after 20 weeks suggests superimposed preeclampsia.</p><p>Preeclampsia is a common risk factor for maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Standard prenatal care, including close follow-up of high-risk women after midgestation, increases the chance that preeclampsia will be detected early in the course of disease. Early diagnosis followed by appropriate management, including delivery, may prevent some of the serious sequelae of the disease, such as eclamptic seizures and multiorgan failure. </p><p>Since there is no curative treatment other than delivery, an intervention that could prevent preeclampsia would have a significant impact on maternal and infant health worldwide. Many different strategies to prevent preeclampsia have been investigated in randomized trials. It is not surprising that most simple approaches have been unsuccessful, given the complexities in pathogenesis and the likelihood that multiple etiologies cause the syndrome. In women at high risk of developing preeclampsia, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> prophylaxis has preventive effects, but the magnitude of benefit in this group is variable and depends on a number of factors. By comparison, no intervention has been proven to be effective in the general obstetric population.</p><p>This topic will review several interventions that have been evaluated for prevention of preeclampsia. Other important aspects of preeclampsia are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early pregnancy prediction of preeclampsia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW-DOSE ASPIRIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> reduces the frequency of preeclampsia, as well as related adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth, growth restriction), by about 10 to 20 percent when given to women at moderate to high risk of the disease. It has an excellent <span class=\"nowrap\">maternal/fetal</span> safety profile in pregnancy; thus, it is a reasonable preventive strategy for these women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H803272901\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The observation that preeclampsia is associated with increased platelet turnover and increased platelet-derived thromboxane levels led to randomized trials evaluating low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy in women thought to be at increased risk of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. As opposed to higher dose aspirin therapy, low-dose aspirin (60 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> diminishes platelet thromboxane synthesis while maintaining vascular wall prostacyclin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Although not well studied, the beneficial effect of low-dose aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia may also be partly related to modulation of inflammation, which is exaggerated in women with preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65619565\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the available data (see <a href=\"#H1898311926\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of efficacy'</a> below), we suggest low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> prophylaxis for women at high risk for preeclampsia. There is no consensus on the criteria that confer high risk. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) risk criteria are reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>USPSTF criteria for high risk include one or more of the following.

Identification of women with an appropriate combination of moderate risk factors to be considered high risk is subjective and determined case by case, as the data describing the magnitude of the association between each of these risk factors and development of preeclampsia vary widely and lack consistency.</p><p>USPSTF criteria for moderate risk include the following. The incidence of preeclampsia is estimated to be less than 8 percent in a pregnant woman with only one of these risk factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nulliparity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity (body mass index &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of preeclampsia in mother or sister</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ge;35 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sociodemographic characteristics (African American race, low socioeconomic level)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal risk factors (eg, previous pregnancy with low birth weight or small for gestational age infant, previous adverse pregnancy outcome [eg, stillbirth], interval &gt;10 years between pregnancies)</p><p/><p>Even though nulliparous women are the group comprising the largest proportion of preeclampsia cases, nulliparity alone is not an indication for prophylaxis, as major trials limited to unselected nulliparous women have found little or no benefit from prophylactic low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Incidence rates in unselected nulliparas are relatively low (approximately 4 percent) compared with high-risk groups (incidence at least 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. One hypothesis for the lack of a statistical effect may be that even though the incidence of preeclampsia in unselected nulliparous women is higher than in multiparas (incidence 1 percent), it is still relatively low compared with women with risk factors such as chronic hypertension (incidence 10 percent) or renal disease (incidence 20 percent). It is also possible that the pathogenesis of preeclampsia in nulliparous women is different from that in women with previous preeclampsia or preexisting vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Multimarker algorithms for identifying women at high risk for preeclampsia have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>], but none are widely used, as they have not been validated in a variety of unselected populations. These algorithms typically include biochemical and imaging results, as well as historical risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-pregnancy-prediction-of-preeclampsia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early pregnancy prediction of preeclampsia&quot;, section on 'Risk prediction models'</a>.) </p><p>Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> appears to be of little or no benefit in women who already have developed preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/6,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20,21</a>]. At this late stage, aspirin does not prevent progression to more severe disease and may exacerbate bleeding in patients with thrombocytopenia related to <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/HELLP</span> syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2205590804\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose and administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We begin daily low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in the 12<sup>th</sup> or 13<sup>th</sup> week of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>], although adverse effects from earlier initiation (eg, preconception) have not been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Early therapy (before 16 weeks) may be important since the pathophysiologic features of preeclampsia develop early in pregnancy, weeks before clinical disease is apparent. However, available evidence is inconsistent about the importance of early initiation of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], possibly because aspirin has major effects on prostacyclin production and endothelial function throughout gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. If aspirin is not initiated at the end of the first trimester, initiation after 16 weeks (but before symptoms develop) may also be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The optimum low dose is unclear. We suggest a daily dose of 100 to 150 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> rather than a lower dose, because in some pregnant women platelet function is not inhibited by the 81 mg dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>] but is altered by higher dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], which appears to be more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/30,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,34</a>]. In the United States, this can be achieved by taking one and one-half 81 mg tablets; however, taking one 81 mg tablet is also reasonable since this is the commercially available dose and has proven efficacy. For prevention of preeclampsia, no trials have evaluated the efficacy of a slightly higher dose of aspirin, which could be achieved easily by taking two 81 mg tablets or splitting a 325 mg tablet in half. This 162 mg dose is one of the options suggested by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke in nonpregnant individuals, aspirin appears to be equally effective at doses between 75 and 325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.

When data from these and other trials were pooled, meta-analyses supported the significance of the trend observed in individual trials. When begun early in the second trimester, use of low-dose aspirin reduced the incidence of preeclampsia by at least 10 percent, with the greatest absolute benefit in women at moderate to high risk of developing the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/13,22,29,30,40,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,22,29,30,40,47-49</a>].

The reductions were lower or insignificant with initiation after 16 weeks, although none of the trials directly compared early versus late initiation of aspirin. The authors also noted a dose-dependent effect whereby the optimum aspirin dose appeared to be 100 to 150 mg of aspirin rather than a lower dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a follow-up 2018 meta-analysis, the same group reported <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> reduced the risk of preterm preeclampsia (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45-0.87), but not term preeclampsia (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70-1.21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. As above, the reduction in preterm preeclampsia was limited to the subgroup in whom aspirin was initiated at &le;16 weeks and at a daily dose &ge;100 mg (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.19-0.57). The follow-up analysis included the Combined Multimarker Screening and Randomized Patient Treatment with Aspirin for Evidence-based Preeclampsia Prevention (ASPRE) trial, a large trial that identified high-risk women using a combination of maternal factors and biophysical and biochemical markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2017 meta-analysis, which used individual participant data from the Perinatal Antiplatelet Review of International Studies (31 trials, over 32,000 women at increased risk of preeclampsia), the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> overall was more modest (10 percent risk reduction), with no difference between women who initiated treatment &lt;16 weeks versus &gt;16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

For women with multiple moderate risk factors, the benefit of aspirin therapy is less clear, so clinicians should use clinical judgment and talk with their patients about the benefits and harms of low-dose aspirin use.

In the United States, the RDA for elemental calcium is 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in pregnant, lactating, or nonpregnant women 19 to 50 years of age (1300 mg for girls 14 to 18 years of age). The United States female population in the reproductive age range has an average calcium intake of 950 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> thus most women are candidates for modest supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The RDA is developed by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy#H717781876\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Calcium and vitamin D'</a>.)</p><p>Calcium supplementation above the RDA does not appear to be of any benefit for prevention of preeclampsia. In the Calcium for Preeclampsia Prevention (CPEP) trial performed in the United States, 4589 healthy nulliparous women at 13 to 21 weeks of gestation were randomly assigned to receive either 2 g of elemental <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/day</span> or placebo therapy during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. No benefit of calcium supplementation was identified: There were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of preeclampsia (6.9 versus 7.3 percent), pregnancy-associated hypertension, or adverse fetal outcomes. The mean calcium intake in the placebo group was 1135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> which is above the RDA. However, no benefit was noted among women whose baseline dietary calcium intake was in the lowest quintile and whose median daily intake was 422 mg, similar to or less than that reported for women in many developing countries. A 2007 evidenced-based review by the US Food and Drug Administration concluded that the relationship between calcium and risk of hypertension is inconsistent and inconclusive, and a relationship between calcium intake and risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia is highly unlikely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>In populations where baseline dietary calcium intake is low, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 1500 to 2000 mg elemental calcium supplementation per day for pregnant women to reduce the risk of preeclampsia, particularly among those at higher risk of developing hypertension (2.5 g of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> or 4.75 g of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium citrate</a> contains about 1 g elemental calcium) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preeclampsia-prevention/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

The reduction in risk was greatest for women with low baseline calcium intake variously defined but always less than 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20-0.65; 8 trials, 10,678 women) and those at high risk of preeclampsia (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12-0.42; 5 trials, 587 women). Preterm birth was also reduced (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60-0.97; 11 trials, 15,275 women), but rates of stillbirth, neonatal intensive care admission, and infant death were similar in both groups. Meta-analysis also found that supplementation with low doses of calcium (&lt;1 gram daily) reduced the risk of preeclampsia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28-0.52; 10 trials, 2234 women); however, most of the trials recruited women at high risk for preeclampsia and were at high risk of bias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4260996288\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In overweight and obese women, prepregnancy weight loss is recommended as it has a variety of reproductive, pregnancy, and overall health benefits.
