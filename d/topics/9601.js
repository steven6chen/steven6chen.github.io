Keloids (from a Greek word meaning &quot;crab's claw&quot;) are fibrous growths that extend beyond the original area of injury to involve the adjacent normal skin. Hypertrophic scars may have a similar clinical appearance, but in contrast with keloids, remain confined within the boundaries of the wound area and tend to regress spontaneously over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Keloids and hypertrophic scars may cause functional impairment and cosmetic disfigurement and are often associated with low self-reported patient quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars.

Keloids have been reported in 5 to 16 percent of individuals of Hispanic and African ancestry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An annual incidence of 15 per 10,000 has been reported in Taiwan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Keloids affect men and women equally and are more common in younger individuals. There is a familial tendency to develop keloids; family studies suggest an autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57677291\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of hypertrophic scars and keloids is incompletely understood. It involves alterations in the sequential process of wound healing and may be influenced by multiple local and genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In normal wound healing there is an initial marked local inflammatory reaction, followed by the formation of new blood vessels, activation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts at the edge of the wound, and synthesis of extracellular matrix components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. After the reepithelialization is completed, the dermal granulation tissue is remodeled into a scar and the replacement tissue adapts to biomechanical requirements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-healing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound healing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116914724\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibroblast proliferation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis are greatly increased in hypertrophic scars and keloids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Overexpression of growth factors, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) appear to play a role in the formation of these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. </p><p>TGF-beta is a regulator of fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis and promotes the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts are characterized by contractile actin filaments and a high production of collagen and have a central role in the contraction and remodeling of the granulation tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In normal wound healing, TGF-beta activity diminishes upon the completion of wound repair, but in keloids TGF-beta is overproduced and poorly regulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/8,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19</a>]. </p><p>Other factors that may be involved in the pathogenesis of keloids and hypertrophic scars include a decreased production of molecules that promote matrix breakdown, such as matrix metalloproteinases; increased numbers of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors on fibroblasts; over-activation of signals for insulin-like growth factor-I; decreased fibroblast apoptosis rate; and increased expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin and fibrocyte activation via stromal cell-derived factor-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33178317\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Keloids occur more frequently in certain ethnic populations; people of African and Asian descent are most susceptible to the development of keloids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This observation and reports of familial cases suggest a genetic contribution to keloid development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/7,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24-26</a>]. Studies of familial keloids have reported varied modes of inheritance; one study of 14 families suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variable expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. </p><p>Multiple genes are likely to be involved in the development of keloids, and attempts to definitively identify the genes involved have been unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A genome-wide association study identified four susceptibility loci on chromosomes 1q41, 3q22.3-23, and 15q21.3 in a Japanese population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, no genes in these regions were definitively linked to keloid formation. </p><p>In contrast with keloids, there is no evidence of a genetic predisposition to develop hypertrophic scars. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66627200\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both hypertrophic scars and keloids exhibit excess collagen formation with varying numbers of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. In hypertrophic scars, the collagen fibers are arranged in a wavy pattern predominantly oriented parallel to the epithelial surface. There are also nodular structures containing myofibroblasts and vertically aligned vessels. In contrast, keloids show characteristic hypocellular zones of fibrous tissue containing thickened, glassy, eosinophilic collagen bundles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97006\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97006 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66627087\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features and classification of keloids and hypertrophic scars are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F95115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95115 \">table 1</a>). Hypertrophic scars usually form at sites of surgical wounds, lacerations, burns, or inflammatory or infectious skin conditions (eg, acne, folliculitis, chicken pox, and vaccinations). They are raised, may be erythematous, and typically do not exceed the margins of the original wound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97014\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97014 \">picture 2</a>). Hypertrophic scars usually show a rapid growth phase of up to six months, followed by possible regression over the following 12 to 18 months. </p><p>Keloids present as raised dermal lesions that extend beyond the boundaries of the original wound and invade the surrounding healthy skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97537\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97537 \">picture 3A</a>). They may arise at sites of minor injuries to the skin, such as earlobe piercings, or may develop in the absence of an obvious inciting stimulus. </p><p>Keloids occur predominantly on the upper chest, shoulders, upper back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97537%7EDERM%2F61382\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97537 graphicRef61382 \">picture 3A-B</a>), and head and neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97009\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97009 \">picture 4C</a>), especially on the ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54044%7EPEDS%2F109966\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54044 graphicRef109966 \">picture 4A-B</a>). Keloids may develop as early as one month after trauma or inflammation, but some may occur up to one year after the inciting event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In contrast with hypertrophic scars, keloids do not regress spontaneously but enlarge progressively over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Pain and pruritus are frequently associated symptoms. Full-thickness burn injuries impair or destroy hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, capillaries, and nerve endings, leading to loss of temperature regulation, dry skin, and neuropathic pain. These scars may also cause functional impairment from contracture or mechanical irritation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57677605\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC SYNDROMES ASSOCIATED WITH KELOID FORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The formation of&nbsp;keloids can be a clinical clue to rare inherited syndromes such as Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and Goeminne syndrome. Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (MIM #180849) is a multiple congenital anomalies syndrome, characterized by broad thumbs and big toes, characteristic facies, and variable growth and intellectual retardation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Individuals with Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome have an increased risk of malignancies and an increased tendency to develop keloids spontaneously or after minor trauma. Keloids are usually multiple and mainly located on the chest and shoulders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

In one study, the applied pressure was 35 mmHg, which was estimated using a digital manometer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>The evidence to support the use of pressure therapy is limited.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keloids present as raised dermal lesions that extend beyond the boundaries of the original wound and invade the surrounding healthy skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F61382%7EDERM%2F54044%7EDERM%2F97537%7EDERM%2F97009\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61382 graphicRef54044 graphicRef97537 graphicRef97009 \">picture 3A-B, 4A, 4C</a>). In contrast, hypertrophic scars are usually confined within the margins of the original wound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F95115\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95115 \">table 1</a>). Symptoms include pain, tenderness, and pruritus. (See <a href=\"#H66627087\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of keloids and hypertrophic scars is usually clinical. However, a skin biopsy should be performed if the diagnosis is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H86757791\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple medical and surgical therapies have been used for the treatment of keloids and hypertrophic scars. However, data on the efficacy of these treatments are limited and there is no universally accepted treatment approach. (See <a href=\"#H57677928\" class=\"local\">'Treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For linear or small hypertrophic scars resulting from surgery or trauma, silicone gel sheeting may be used as initial treatment. Pressure therapy, if feasible and tolerated by the patient, may be an alternative first-line treatment. Second-line therapies include intralesional corticosteroids, laser therapy, and surgical excision. (See <a href=\"#H57678051\" class=\"local\">'Linear or small hypertrophic scars'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For minor keloids (&lt;0.5 cm), we suggest intralesional corticosteroids as the first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Triamcinolone</a> acetonide 10 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> is injected using a 27- or 30-gauge needle until skin blanching is noted (usually 0.1 to 0.5 mL). Silicone gel sheeting or pressure therapy may be used as adjunctive therapies. Second-line therapies include intralesional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in combination with intralesional corticosteroids, contact or intralesional cryotherapy, or laser therapy. (See <a href=\"#H57678063\" class=\"local\">'Minor keloids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For major keloids (&gt;0.5 cm), intralesional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> is the first-line therapy to control pruritus and pain, increase scar pliability, and reduce volume. Adjunctive treatments include intralesional 5-FU and contact or intralesional cryotherapy. For large earlobe keloids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54044\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54044 \">picture 4A</a>) that cause considerable cosmetic disfigurement, the initial treatment is often surgical excision in combination with perioperative intralesional corticosteroids, compression, or radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"#H57678069\" class=\"local\">'Major keloids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of extensive hypertrophic burn scars and keloids is discussed separately.
