Herpes is caused by a virus that is passed from person to person during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Sometimes, people do not know they have herpes because they do not have any symptoms.</p><p>Herpes cannot be cured. But the disease usually causes most problems during the first few years. After that, the virus is still there, but it causes few to no symptoms. Even when the virus is active, people with herpes can take medicines to reduce and help prevent symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472670104\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of herpes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with herpes never have any symptoms. But other people can develop symptoms within a few weeks of being infected with the herpes virus.</p><p>Symptoms usually include blisters in the genital area. In women, this area includes the vagina, butt, anus, or thighs. In men, this area includes the penis, scrotum, anus, butt, or thighs. The blisters can become painful open sores, which then crust over as they heal.</p><p>Sometimes, people can have other symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blisters on the mouth or lips</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever, headache, or pain in the joints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble urinating</p><p/><p>In people with herpes, symptoms usually go away and come back. A return of symptoms is called an &quot;outbreak.&quot; Outbreaks usually include blisters and open sores in the genital area. In most people, the first outbreak is the worst and can last as long as 2 to 3 weeks. Outbreaks that happen later are usually not as severe and do not last as long.</p><p>Outbreaks might occur every month or more often, or just once or twice a year. Sometimes, people can tell when an outbreak will occur, because they feel itching or pain beforehand. Sometimes they do not know that an outbreak is coming because they have no symptoms. Whatever your pattern is, keep in mind that herpes outbreaks usually become less frequent over time as you get older.</p><p>Certain things, called &quot;triggers,&quot; can make outbreaks more likely to occur. These include stress, sunlight, menstrual periods, or getting sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472670111\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for herpes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have blisters or ulcers when your doctor or nurse examines you, he or she can order a test to look for herpes. There are a few different tests that can do this. For all of them, the doctor or nurse takes a sample of cells or fluid from a sore and sends it to the lab. Sometimes they will also take a blood sample to find out if you have been exposed to the virus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472670118\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse the first time you have symptoms, or if your symptoms are severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472670125\"><span class=\"h1\">How is herpes treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor can prescribe different medicines to help reduce symptoms and speed up the healing of an outbreak. These medicines work best when people start them soon after an outbreak starts. You and your doctor should work together to decide which medicine is right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472670132\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To reduce the pain during an outbreak, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a portable bath (such as a &quot;Sitz bath&quot;) where you can sit in warm water for about 20 minutes. Your bathtub could also work. Avoid bubble baths.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the genital area clean and dry, and avoid tight clothes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take over-the-counter pain medicine such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin). But avoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>.</p><p/><p>You should also let your doctor or nurse know if you are worried or upset about your herpes. He or she can talk with you about your feelings. Plus, you might want to join a support group for people with herpes. You can also call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STD hotline at 1-800-227-8922 for help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472670139\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant, talk with your doctor. It is possible for a baby to get herpes from its mother during birth, especially if the mother's first outbreak starts near the time of delivery. Talk with your doctor or nurse about things you can do to help prevent this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472670146\"><span class=\"h1\">Can future outbreaks of symptoms be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with herpes take a medicine every day to help prevent future outbreaks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472670153\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to prevent spreading herpes to my sex partner?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People are most likely to spread herpes to a sex partner when they have blisters and open sores on their body. But people can also spread herpes to their sex partner when they do not have any symptoms. That is because herpes can be present on the body without causing any symptoms, like blisters or pain. You can decrease the risk of spreading herpes to your partner by taking an antiviral medicine every day.</p><p>You can also reduce the chance of your sex partner getting herpes by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telling your sex partner that you have herpes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a condom every time you have sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having sex when you have symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having oral sex if you have blisters or open sores (in the genital area or around your mouth)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472670160\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Screening for sexually transmitted infections (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anogenital-warts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anogenital warts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Trichomoniasis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Genital herpes (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
