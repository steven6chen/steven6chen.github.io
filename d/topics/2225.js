Evaluation of breast pain is important to determine whether the pain is due to normal physiological changes related to hormonal fluctuation or to a pathologic process such as breast cancer. Breast pain is usually mild, although approximately 11 percent of affected women will describe their pain as moderate to severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the etiology, evaluation, and treatment of breast pain in women. Evaluation of a breast mass is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-a-palpable-breast-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of a palpable breast mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not completely characterized, the prevalence of breast pain appears to depend on the population studied. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series of 10,000 consecutively seen female patients (mean age, 46 years) referred for breast evaluation, 5 percent had a chief complaint of breast pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a separate study of almost 1700 women (mean age, 34 years) surveyed by online questionnaire, over half (51.5 percent) had experienced breast pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pain was more commonly reported among older women, those with larger breast sizes, and those less fit <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physically active. In addition, of those who reported symptoms, 41 and 35 percent reported negative impacts from breast pain on their sexual health and sleep, respectively. Of interest, 10 percent of those symptomatic had reported breast pain as an issue for over half of their lives.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast pain may be cyclical (two-thirds) or noncyclical (one-third) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cyclical pain is usually associated with hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle, usually presenting in the week prior to onset of menses. It is frequently bilateral, and most severe in the upper outer quadrant of the breasts. Noncyclical pain is more likely to be related to a breast or chest wall lesion and may be constant or intermittent. Solitary cysts, particularly when the presentation is abrupt, are frequently painful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cysts-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast cysts: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclical breast pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor cyclical breast discomfort is normal; it begins during the late luteal phase and dissipates with onset of menses. This is usually bilateral and diffuse pain. Cyclical breast discomfort is caused by normal hormonal changes associated with ovulation that stimulate the proliferation of normal glandular breast tissue and result in pain. The stimulation of ductal elements by estrogen, stimulation of the stroma by progesterone, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stimulation of ductal secretion by prolactin all contribute to cyclical pain during the menstrual cycle. Cyclical breast pain can also be associated with pharmacologic hormonal agents (eg, postmenopausal hormone therapy or oral contraceptive pills). </p><p>For many women, cyclical breast pain can cause problems with their activities of daily living. As an example, in a study of 1171 healthy premenopausal women, 11 percent reported moderate to severe pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This interfered with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual activity (48 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical activity (37 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social activity (12 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>School activity (8 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Noncyclical breast pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noncyclical breast pain does not follow the usual menstrual pattern and is more likely to be unilateral and variable in its location in the breast. Multiple etiologies can cause noncyclical breast pain, as detailed below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large pendulous breasts &ndash; Large pendulous breasts may cause pain due to stretching of Cooper's ligaments. Neck, back, and shoulder pain and headache may be present, as well as a rash under the pendulous breast. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diet, lifestyle &ndash; The role of diet and lifestyle in causing breast pain is uncertain, although some women have reported benefit from modifying aspects of their usual diet. Controlled studies have not demonstrated an effect of caffeine on fibrocystic breast changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], though patients report pain relief with caffeine avoidance, possibly through a placebo effect. Nicotine may increase breast pain by increasing epinephrine levels and through epinephrine's stimulatory effect on cyclic AMP (3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate). Thus, smoking cessation may be associated with a reduction of mastalgia, although this effect may also be related to a placebo effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormone replacement therapy &ndash; Up to one-third of menopausal women receiving postmenopausal hormone therapy experience some degree of noncyclical breast pain, which may spontaneously resolve over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ductal ectasia &ndash; Ductal ectasia is characterized by distention of subareolar ducts due to inflammation unrelated to infection. Ductal ectasia may be associated with fever and acute local pain and tenderness caused by penetration of the duct wall by lipid material, which may resolve to leave a subareolar nodule. In one study, the site and degree of duct dilatation correlated with the intensity of noncyclical breast pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mastitis &ndash; Mastitis or breast abscess is most common in lactating women in the first month after giving birth, but can also occur in women not lactating. It is usually caused by an obstructive lactopathy. When initiating lactation, the nipple and areolar skin often undergo local inflammation and swelling until the nipple is conditioned to frequent suckling. This swelling results in relative obstruction to milk flow that can then be seeded by skin bacteria (eg, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcal species) leading to bacterial mastitis. The breast becomes diffusely painful, swollen, and red; with an area of fluctuance and eventually pointing if an abscess develops. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactational-mastitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactational mastitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common problems of breastfeeding and weaning&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory breast cancer &ndash; Women with de novo inflammatory breast cancer (primary disease) may present with pain and a rapidly progressing tender, firm, enlarged breast. The skin over the breast is warm and thickened, with a &quot;peau d'orange&quot; (orange skin) appearance, but there is often no fever or leukocytosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70894\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70894 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82220\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82220 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inflammatory-breast-cancer-clinical-features-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inflammatory breast cancer: Clinical features and treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hidradenitis suppurativa &ndash; Hidradenitis suppurativa can involve the breast and present as breast nodules and pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other &ndash; Other etiologies of breast pain include pregnancy, thrombophlebitis, trauma, macrocysts, prior breast surgery, and a variety of medications (hormones as well as some antidepressants, cardiovascular agents, and antibiotics) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Extramammary pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients who present with self-diagnosed breast pain actually have referred pain from sources outside of the breast. Extramammary pain may be from musculoskeletal sources such as chest wall pain, spinal or paraspinal problem, trauma or scarring from prior biopsy. It may also be related to medical problems such as biliary, pulmonary, esophageal, or cardiac disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest wall pain &ndash; Chest wall pain is often lateral and may be burning or knife-like, localized or diffuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major causes of musculoskeletal chest pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chest wall pain is frequently due to the pectoralis major muscle, related to activities such as water-skiing, raking, rowing, shoveling, or other actions that strain or use the pectoral muscle repetitively. The pain can be reproduced by asking the patient to place her hand flat on the iliac wing and push inward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Chest wall pain, usually presenting as bilateral, parasternal discomfort, can also arise from costochondritis (typically the second through fifth costochondral junctions) or Tietze's syndrome (typically second and third costochondral junctions), which usually cause bilateral, parasternal discomfort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other etiologies include slipping and clicking ribs and arthritis. Radicular chest wall pain may be due to cervical arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Local heat and analgesics may relieve pain, but most women do not require therapy beyond reassurance that the source of pain is muscle strain or articular. In severe cases, injection of the affected area with local anesthetic and corticosteroid can be diagnostic and therapeutic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal and paraspinal disorders &ndash; This pain typically occurs in older women in whom vertebral, spinal, and paraspinal problems in the neck and upper thorax accumulate with age. Paraspinal muscle spasm and other impingements on the free course of the sensory nerves from the neck and upper thorax can cause a radiculopathy leading to pain or hyperesthesia. Burning pain, which is typical of nerve root pressure, is a common feature. Imaging studies of the neck may reveal the etiology of the pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other &ndash; Chest wall pain induced by trauma or trauma-induced fat necrosis, intercostal neuralgia often due to a respiratory infection, and underlying pleuritic lesions can mimic benign breast disease. Similarly, gallbladder disease or ischemic heart disease may present as intermittent chest pain attributed to the breast.</p><p/><p>Postthoracotomy syndrome is an unusual disorder in which a healing chest wound simulates the effect of a suckling infant. It can be associated with an elevated prolactin concentration, breast pain, and milk production. A similar effect can be seen with other forms of chest wall irritation, including burns and chafing from clothing overlying the nipple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It may be helpful to ask women with cyclical pain to record the occurrence and severity of breast pain in a diary and note potential aggravating and ameliorating factors. Questions the patient should be asked about her pain include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where in the breast does the pain occur?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the pain bilateral?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What does the pain feel like?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How severe is the pain?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it phasic, with peaks at midcycle and premenstrually?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it associated with use of oral contraceptive pills or hormone replacement therapy?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did it begin after a recent birth or pregnancy loss or termination?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is it related to vigorous or repetitive use of the pectoral muscle group?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there concurrent neck, back, or shoulder problem?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there systemic or other local symptoms, such as fever or erythema?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there a history of recent trauma to the chest?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the pain affect her ability to perform daily activities?</p><p/><p>In addition, a complete medical and surgical history and systematic review of systems should be obtained. Breast cancer risk should be assessed.

If the pain is diffuse and symptoms classic for cyclical breast pain, neither a mammogram nor ultrasound are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, some patients may not be comfortable without an imaging study. In that clinical setting, a targeted ultrasound is the optimal study for women under age 30 with no high risk factors for breast cancer (eg, family history of premenopausal breast cancer) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women&quot;</a>). For women over age 30, a mammogram and a targeted ultrasound can be performed. In the clinical setting of a suspicious finding, a mammogram is performed for women of any age.</p><p>For women with <strong>focal pain without a mass</strong>, or a history and examination not consistent with classic cyclical pain (eg, sudden onset of focal pain), a targeted ultrasound or a mammogram should be performed. In a retrospective review of 257 patients with focal breast pain and no palpable mass, a breast cancer was found by ultrasound in three patients (1.2 percent) at the site of the pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. No patient with a category BI-RADS 1, 2, or 3 ultrasound had a cancer detected. In addition, mammography was performed in 206 patients. Three patients who had a mammographic BI-RADS 4 or 5 category were diagnosed with breast cancer, the same three patients identified with cancer by ultrasonography. Of the 36 patients with focal pain, no palpable mass, and category BI-RADS 1 mammogram, 25 percent had a mass detected by ultrasound, 26 cysts and 6 benign solid masses, and no cancer. The addition of an ultrasound to the mammogram did not result in the detection of any additional cancers.</p><p>If the pain is cyclical and no abnormality is found on physical examination or imaging studies, a breast cancer diagnosis is unlikely. Those with negative findings can be treated supportively, as described below. Positive imaging studies require appropriate follow-up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-imaging-for-cancer-screening-mammography-and-ultrasonography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast imaging for cancer screening: Mammography and ultrasonography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After obtaining normal findings on clinical and imaging studies, simple reassurance that the patient does not have breast cancer provides adequate relief for most women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. For those who seek treatment, several therapies have been shown to relieve breast pain. However, most recommendations for treatment of mastalgia are based upon data from observational or case-controlled studies, with minimal or no data from randomized controlled trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of diet and lifestyle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of diet and lifestyle in relieving cyclical breast pain is unclear, with a strong likelihood of a placebo response for many interventions. A low fat (15 percent of calories), high complex carbohydrate diet has been effective in some observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/16,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23,24</a>]. Elimination of caffeine has not been effective in controlled trials, although it seems to be helpful in some women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Inconclusive evidence exists for the role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin E</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and evening primrose oil&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] in reducing pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic relief</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Support garments &ndash; A well-fitting brassiere to better support the breast is widely advocated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The use of support bra with steel underwire tends to reduce mastalgia in women with pendulous breasts. In addition, use of a &quot;sports bra&quot; during exercise has been shown to reduce pain related to breast movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compresses &ndash; Some women obtain relief from application of warm compresses or ice packs or gentle massage. Ice packs are recommended during the obstructive (prebacterial) phase of puerperal mastitis to decrease milk production regionally and thereby relieve ductal intraluminal pressure and subsequent pain.

Topical NSAIDs may also be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. At least one topical NSAID has been available in the United States (US) for many years: salicylate, the active ingredient in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, is found in Aspercreme and Nuprin.

Similarly, decreasing the dose of estrogen in an oral contraceptive regimen can be effective in controlling breast pain. Oral contraceptives can reduce breast pain severity and duration in some women with cyclical symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

Breast pain may occur at the time of presentation of a breast cancer, although the pain is typically associated with adjacent benign, cystic breast tissue rather than the cancer. One caveat in retrospective studies is that recall of breast pain might be increased after the diagnosis of breast cancer. In addition, pain may also occur following a core biopsy of the cancer rather than being associated with the cancer itself. For example, one case-control study showed that in women referred for mammography, the incidence of breast cancer was similar in the painful breast (0.5 percent), the nonpainful breast (0.5 percent), and in women without breast pain undergoing routine screening (0.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-pain/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that women who present with mastalgia can be reasonably reassured that their risk of breast cancer is similar to a woman without mastalgia, in the absence of an abnormal examination.

It is uncommon for a breast cancer to specifically cause breast pain. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast pain is common in premenstrual women. Elements from the history can help distinguish pain that is cyclical versus noncyclical, and that which is breast related versus extramammary. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We initiate the evaluation of breast pain with a thorough history and physical examination. Clinical judgment is used when deciding if imaging tests are necessary. For women of any age with a suspicious clinical examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> history, a mammogram and targeted ultrasound are performed. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For young women (under age 30) with cyclical breast pain, an ultrasound is the optimal imaging study. However, unless there are pertinent high risk factors (eg, family history of premenopausal breast cancer), diagnostic studies are not necessary for most young women. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a focal finding on the clinical examination (eg, discrete mass or focal tenderness), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history not consistent with classic cyclical pain (eg, sudden onset of focal pain), a mammogram and a targeted ultrasound are performed. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with analgesics and a supportive brassiere can be helpful for many women with mastalgia. Other medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, may be used in women with severe mastalgia, but these drugs have significant adverse effects. Patients should be informed of potential risks and included in the decision as to whether the risks outweigh the potential benefits of symptom relief.
