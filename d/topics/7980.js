There are different types of arthritis. The most common type, called osteoarthritis, often comes with age. It can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in the finger joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid arthritis &ndash; Rheumatoid arthritis is another type of arthritis. It can also cause pain, stiffness, and swelling in the finger joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70434\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70434 \">picture 1</a>). The stiffness is usually worst in the morning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trigger finger &ndash; This condition keeps a finger from straightening normally. When people try to straighten their trigger finger, the finger &quot;locks&quot; or &quot;catches&quot; in a bent position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F80186\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80186 \">picture 2</a>). Trigger finger can also cause pain in the finger or palm. Trigger finger is caused by a problem with a tendon. Tendons are strong bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cysts &ndash; A cyst is an abnormal fluid-filled sac. If a cyst forms on or next to a tendon, it can cause a painful lump in the palm of the hand. Cysts can also form on joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61957\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61957 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dupuytren's contracture &ndash; This condition causes the tissue under the skin on the palm to get thick. Over time, this makes the fingers (usually the ring and little fingers) stiff and keeps them from straightening all the way (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60082\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60082 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mallet finger &ndash; Mallet finger can happen when the finger joint nearest the fingernail gets hurt. People usually have pain and swelling on top of that joint. They can also have trouble straightening that joint all the way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carpal tunnel syndrome &ndash; This condition affects a nerve that passes through the wrist to the hand. It usually causes pain, numbness, and tingling in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and side of the ring finger. People can also have pain in their arm.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6762507\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To ease your symptoms, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest your hand &ndash; Don't grip things too tightly or too often.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put heat on the area to reduce pain and stiffness &ndash; Don't use heat for more than 20 minutes at a time. Don't use anything too hot that could burn your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do gentle exercises &ndash; Close your fingers to make a fist. Then straighten your fingers all the way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicine to reduce pain and swelling &ndash; To treat pain, you can take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol). To treat pain and swelling, you can take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</p><p/><p>To keep your hands from getting hurt:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear thick leather gloves when you do work that could hurt your hands</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not let your hands get too cold for too long</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6762522\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should see a doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms do not get better or get worse after you treat them on your own for a few days.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your hand is weak.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You can't make a fist or straighten your fingers all the way.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6762537\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will examine your hand and fingers carefully and see how they move and work.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse might do 1 or more of the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An X-ray of your hand</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure to make sure the diagnosis is correct &ndash; For example, if the doctor thinks that you have a cyst, he or she might drain the fluid with a needle.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6762552\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hand pain treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the cause of the hand pain.
