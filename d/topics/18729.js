This carboxylase activity is found in essentially all mammalian tissues, and its reaction product, Gla, has been observed in both vertebrates and invertebrates; both play an important biological role in protein function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The functions of Gla and the vitamin K-dependent biosynthesis of Gla will be discussed here.

The mechanism by which vitamin K participates as a cofactor with the carboxylase is incompletely understood. The most attractive hypothesis is that an activated species of vitamin K abstracts a hydrogen from the gamma-carbon of Glu residues on specific proteins (factors VII, IX, X, and prothrombin; proteins S and C; and, in bone, osteocalcin [bone Gla protein] and matrix Gla protein), followed by transformation of the vitamin K intermediate to an epoxide. Carbon dioxide is subsequently added to the gamma-carbon of glutamic acid, utilizing the carboxylase activity of gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, to form Gla (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61632\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61632 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Based on a nonenzymatic model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], a &quot;base strength amplification mechanism&quot; has been proposed to explain the conversion of the weak base form of vitamin K (vitamin KH2) into an oxygenated intermediate (the alkoxide) of sufficient basicity to abstract a hydrogen from the gamma-carbon of Glu (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61632\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61632 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It was initially proposed that a free cysteine in the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase was responsible for deprotonation of vitamin KH2, a hypothesis that is supported by numerous publications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/18-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-28</a>]. However, other studies suggest that the role of a free cysteine residue in carboxylation is uncertain, and implicate two lysine residues in the gamma-glutamyl carboxylase as important for catalysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Gamma-glutamyl carboxylase has two actions: it promotes the formation of Gla on the Glu residues; and it promotes the formation of the highly reactive alkoxide which then collapses into the epoxide form of vitamin K [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/16,18,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,31</a>]. Thus, under normal conditions, for each molecule of Gla generated, one molecule of vitamin K epoxide is also formed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>The short-lived highly reactive alkoxide is potentially toxic, and it would be undesirable for it to be generated in the absence of Glu residues. Evidence indicates that no highly reactive vitamin K intermediate is generated by the carboxylase until a carboxylase substrate is bound to the enzyme and converts its vitamin K epoxidase function to an active state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The epoxide is then recycled back to vitamin KH2 via a vitamin K reductase (see below).</p><p>The propeptide region of the vitamin K-dependent proteins functions as a recognition sequence, binding the carboxylase to its substrate on the adjacent glutamic acid rich (Gla) domain (see below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. It also stimulates gamma-glutamyl carboxylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93532094\"><span class=\"h1\">RECYCLING OF VITAMIN K</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In its naturally occurring form, vitamin K is in the quinone oxidation state and must be reduced to the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> form (vitamin KH2), the active cofactor for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The enzyme responsible for this conversion is known as vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) because it also reduces the vitamin K epoxide formed during the carboxylation reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

VKOR is effective at low concentrations of vitamin K epoxide and vitamin K quinone and is the physiologically important enzyme for recycling vitamin K [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>Homologs of VKOR have been identified in a variety of organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Like VKOR, all the homologs contain an active site CXXC motif as well as an additional pair of cysteines that are conserved. Bacterial VKOR homologs catalyze disulfide bond formation in secreted proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The reducing equivalents required by the bacterial VKOR are provided by periplasmic thioredoxin-like proteins or by a thioredoxin-like domain fused to the VKOR domain. Reducing equivalents required for conversion of vitamin K quinone or epoxide to the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> by mammalian VKOR are provided by endoplasmic reticulum thioredoxin-like proteins. Determination of the crystal structure of a naturally occurring bacterial VKOR-thioredoxin domain fusion protein has suggested an electron transfer pathway that could apply to all VKOR homologs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Newly synthesized proteins in the periplasm or endoplasmic reticulum reduce the CXXC motif of a thioredoxin-like protein, which in turn reduces a conserved disulfide bridge in a loop of VKOR. The loop cysteines reduce the CXXC motif of VKOR and finally the disulfide in this CXXC motif is reestablished by reduction of a quinone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In mammalian systems, TMX, an endoplasmic reticulum membrane anchored thioredoxin-like protein, is the likely source of the reducing equivalents required for reduction of the epoxide and quinone by VKOR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>A second enzyme, DT-diaphorase, an NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, reduces the quinone form of vitamin K but not vitamin K epoxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This enzyme requires high concentrations of vitamin K and probably does not play a role in recycling at physiologic tissue concentrations of vitamin K [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. It may, however, be important when vitamin K, in the quinone form, is used to overcome <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> intoxication or poisoning with vitamin K antagonist rodenticides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. These &quot;superwarfarins&quot; are VKOR inhibitors that are two orders of magnitude more potent than warfarin and have half-lives measured in weeks. Treatment with high doses of vitamin K <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> for several months or years is often required to reverse the coagulopathy associated with superwarfarin poisoning.

The finding in warfarin-treated patients of a significant positive correlation between the INR and plasma vitamin K epoxide concentrations suggests that the latter reflects the pharmacodynamic activity of warfarin in anticoagulated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93532117\"><span class=\"h2\">Mutations and polymorphisms of the VKOR complex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations of a protein in the VKOR complex have been described in a number of families with deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>].

In the vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins (factors VII, IX, X, prothrombin) and regulatory proteins (proteins S and C), the recognition site is within the propeptide region; in contrast, the gamma-carboxylation recognition site resides within the mature protein sequence itself in matrix Gla protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>The amino acids of this recognition site bind directly to the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Although no consensus sequence prevails in the carboxylation recognition sites, these sites are best defined by a Z-F-Z-X-X-X-X-A motif, where Z is an aliphatic hydrophobic residue (isoleucine, valine, or leucine), F is phenylalanine, A is alanine, and X is any amino acid. Phenylalanine at residue 16 is preferred in carboxylase substrates, but leucine, valine, and lysine at this position also support carboxylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>Disruption of the carboxylation recognition site in the propeptide region of factor IX yields a final protein that either lacks or is deficient in Gla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, this recognition site is required for gamma-carboxylation to occur. It is most likely that this region of the blood coagulation protein precursor docks with the membrane-bound carboxylase, bringing the active site of the carboxylase in close proximity to the substrate Glu residues on the precursor form of the vitamin K-dependent proteins. There is no evidence that the amino acid sequence or three-dimensional structural elements in the immediate vicinity of the Glu residues contribute significantly to the recognition of the protein substrate by the carboxylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>To test this hypothesis concerning the function of the recognition site, a prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">propeptide/thrombin</span> chimera was constructed, which had the signal peptide and gamma-carboxylation recognition site-containing propeptide of prothrombin juxtaposed to a glutamate-rich C-terminal region of thrombin. Of the eight glutamic acids within the first 40 residues of the NH2-terminus of prothrombin adjacent to the propeptide, which are not normally gamma-carboxylated, at least seven underwent complete carboxylation when this chimeric protein was expressed in CHO cells.</p><p>These results indicate that the prothrombin gamma-carboxylation recognition site on the propeptide is sufficient to direct carboxylation of adjacent Glu residues in the <span class=\"nowrap\">propeptide/thrombin</span> chimera by the carboxylase, without regard for the sequence context of the Glu substrate or structures defined by disulfide bonds.

As an example of the importance of alanine at position 10 as part of the carboxylation recognition site, an experimentally induced mutation at this site is associated with diminished gamma-carboxylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/10,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,62,63</a>].

Studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing prothrombin showed that uncarboxylated proprothrombin is completely gamma-carboxylated in the endoplasmic reticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

The question therefore arises as to the mechanism which prevents the fully gamma-carboxylated intracellular precursor vitamin K-dependent proteins, such as proprothrombin, from binding to endoplasmic reticular membranes during transit through the biosynthetic pathway. The calcium concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum is high, in contrast to the cytoplasm, and is sufficient to support protein-membrane interaction.</p><p>Fully carboxylated profactor IX does not bind to membranes in the presence of calcium ions, whereas factor IX does [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

In addition, several proteins that contain Gla domains homologous to those of blood coagulation but of unknown function have been identified. These include Gas6 and four proteins that contain transmembrane regions as well as a Gla domain.</p><p>Gamma-carboxyglutamic acid distinguishes itself from aspartic acid and glutamic acid by containing two carboxyl groups in its side chain. The bivalent nature of Gla is similar to the immunoglobulins or fibrinogen. In these cases, a structural framework is formed via the linking of one ligand to another through a common bivalent, symmetrical molecule. As is described below, this also applies to the formation of the calcium-carboxylate network that stabilizes the Gla domains and, in the vitamin K-dependent proteins of blood coagulation, allows expression of the phospholipid binding site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24075397\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma proteins of blood coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation and regulatory proteins contain 10 to 12 Gla residues in the Gla domain, which is located within the first 40 residues of the N-termini of the mature proteins. The Gla domain, in association with the adjacent aromatic amino acid stack domain, functions as a membrane binding component of these proteins.</p><p>Gla is an amino acid that confers metal binding properties on the vitamin K-dependent proteins. With the addition of calcium ions, these proteins undergo a structural transition that leads to exposure of a phospholipid binding site. In most cases, neither aspartic acid nor Glu will substitute for the function of Gla, emphasizing the importance of the presence of both carboxyl groups on a single amino acid.</p><p>The inability of Glu to substitute for Gla and the importance of vitamin K are best illustrated clinically by the usefulness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. Warfarin prevents the recycling of vitamin K from the oxidized (epoxide) to the reduced form (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a>), leading to decreased gamma-glutamyl carboxylation because of insufficient active cofactor (the hydroquinone) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61632\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61632 \">figure 1</a>). The abnormal forms of the vitamin K-dependent proteins that result from the use of warfarin are undercarboxylated, having Glu residues at some or all of the positions that are usually carboxylated (ie, Gla). These proteins are for the most part biologically inert. Thus, in patients treated with warfarin, circulating coagulant activity correlates closely with the quantity of fully carboxylated proteins remaining in the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Elimination of even one Gla residue can significantly reduce the biological function of these proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

The vitamin K-dependent carboxylase is an integral membrane protein, requiring carbon dioxide, molecular oxygen, and the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> form of vitamin K to convert glutamic acid (Glu) residues to Gla (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61632\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61632 \">figure 1</a>). Mutations of the carboxylase gene have been described, leading to a congenital bleeding disorder with deficiency of all vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. (See <a href=\"#H93532088\" class=\"local\">'Biosynthesis of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid'</a> above and <a href=\"#H93532141\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin K-dependent carboxylase'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For each molecule of Gla generated, one molecule of vitamin K epoxide is also formed. Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) is responsible for the conversion of vitamin K to the active cofactor for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase; it also reduces the vitamin K epoxide formed during the carboxylation reaction. Therapeutic doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> inhibit this reductase, resulting in insufficient generation of vitamin K <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a> to support full carboxylation and therefore full function of the vitamin K-dependent proteins of blood coagulation. (See <a href=\"#H93532094\" class=\"local\">'Recycling of vitamin K'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gla is an amino acid that confers metal binding properties on the vitamin K-dependent proteins. With the addition of calcium ions, these proteins undergo a structural transition that leads to exposure of a phospholipid binding site. Factors that require Gla for their function include prothrombin (factor II) and factors VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S. (See <a href=\"#H24075374\" class=\"local\">'Function of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other Gla-requiring proteins (eg, the bone and matrix Gla proteins, protein Z) are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H24076029\" class=\"local\">'Gla-containing proteins of mineralized tissue'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24076035\" class=\"local\">'Other mammalian vitamin K-dependent proteins'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-k-and-the-synthesis-and-function-of-gamma-carboxyglutamic-acid/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Vermeer C, De Boer-Van den Berg MA.
