Gallstone disease during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of preterm birth, maternal morbidity and readmission, as well as neonatal morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In pregnant women with biliary colic, supportive care will lead to resolution of symptoms in most cases, but the symptoms frequently recur later in pregnancy. Some pregnant women will require an invasive procedure because of repeated attacks of biliary colic or because of complicated gallstone disease: acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, or gallstone pancreatitis. After acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis is the second most common nonobstetrical indication for surgery in pregnant women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71938\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71938 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Issues related primarily to gallstones in pregnant women will be reviewed here.

A relative overproduction of hydrophobic bile acids, such as chenodeoxycholate, reduces the ability of bile to solubilize cholesterol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progesterone slows gallbladder emptying, which further promotes the formation of stones by causing bile stasis.</p><p/><p>These changes normalize one to two months following delivery.</p><p>Symptoms related to gallstones develop when the gallbladder contracts in response to hormonal or neural stimulation, usually due to a fatty meal. Contraction forces stones (or possibly sludge or microlithiasis) against the gallbladder outlet or cystic duct opening, leading to increased intra-gallbladder pressure and pain. The stones often fall back from the cystic duct as the gallbladder relaxes, with amelioration of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140710445\"><span class=\"h1\">PERSONAL RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major independent risk factor for gallstones is prepregnancy obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Although the prevalence of gallstones has been reported to be higher in multiparous versus nulliparous women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>], increasing age and obesity as well as genetic background may account for the persistence and further growth of the stones that develop during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In a prospective study, dietary fat and protein intake during pregnancy did not appear to affect women's risk of forming biliary sludge and stones during pregnancy or up to four to six weeks postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Likewise, efforts to decrease the likelihood of stones and sludge developing during pregnancy by increasing metabolic expenditure have proven unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H210627438\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND COURSE IN PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of gallstone-related disease in pregnant women is low (0.05 to 0.33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>], with reported values depending on patient selection, frequency of assessment, and diagnostic definitions and techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In one of the largest studies, a prospective serial ultrasound study of over 3200 pregnant women without gallstones at their first ultrasound examination, new <span class=\"nowrap\">sludge/new</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">stones/progression</span> of baseline sludge was noted in 7.1 percent of women on at least one ultrasound by the second trimester, in 7.9 percent of women by the third trimester, and in 10.2 percent of women by four to six weeks postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, among women with sludge or stones, only 1.2 percent developed any symptoms attributable to the gallbladder during pregnancy.</p><p>In the postpartum period, gallbladder sludge resolved in 61 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and approximately 30 percent of stones smaller than 10 mm disappeared due, at least in part, to unsaturation of bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Most women with sludge during pregnancy had a normal ultrasound examination one year after delivery, but abnormal ultrasound findings remained in approximately 80 percent of patients with stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>].</p><p>Serious complications of gallstones, such as acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, gangrenous gallbladder, or pancreatitis, developed in &lt;10 percent of symptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/7,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31120837\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140711783\"><span class=\"h2\">Categorization of presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of gallstone disease during pregnancy is similar to that in the nonpregnant state. It is helpful to categorize presentation into the following clinical groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No symptoms, but gallstones on ultrasound examination (incidental gallstones)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical biliary symptoms and gallstones on ultrasound examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical symptoms and gallstones on ultrasound examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical biliary symptoms, but no gallstones on ultrasound examination</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140711703\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all pregnant women undergo one or more obstetrical ultrasound examinations, which may include the right upper quadrant (RUQ). Thus, an incidental finding of gallstones is not uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140710840\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients, the first symptoms experienced from gallstones are recurrent pain attacks (biliary colic). Patients with biliary colic complain of epigastric or RUQ pain. The onset of pain is typically between one and three hours postprandially. A history of fatty food ingestion before the initial onset of pain is common. The discomfort progresses in less than one hour to a steady plateau that ranges from moderate to excruciating and remains constant for more than one hour, then slowly subsides over several hours.</p><p>Less frequently, the initial symptoms are those of one of the complications of gallstones, most commonly acute cholecystitis. The presentation of acute cholecystitis is similar to that in nonpregnant women: RUQ or epigastric pain that is steady and severe, prolonged (more than four to six hours), and possibly radiating to the right shoulder or back. Associated symptoms include fever, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Abdominal examination usually demonstrates voluntary and involuntary guarding and, frequently, a positive Murphy's sign. The constitutional symptoms and prolonged duration of pain help to distinguish acute cholecystitis from biliary colic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholecystitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cholecystitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H63322883\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cholecystitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Murphy's sign'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients present with a variety of atypical symptoms, and gallstones are observed on ultrasound examination, but they do not have typical biliary colic. These patients should be evaluated for alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncomplicated-gallstone-disease-in-adults#H22973364\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncomplicated gallstone disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Atypical symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140711789\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory studies should be normal in patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease, both during asymptomatic periods and during attacks of pain. Abnormal blood tests such as leukocytosis, elevated liver, or pancreas tests suggest the development of a complication of gallstone disease, such as cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis. Laboratory results need to be interpreted with respect to the normal range for pregnant women, which is sometimes different from the nonpregnant state. (See <a href=\"#H127317\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H215897\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF PREGNANT WOMEN WITH RUQ OR EPIGASTRIC PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In pregnant women with right upper quadrant (RUQ) or epigastric pain, both pregnancy-related and nonpregnancy-related clinical diagnoses must be considered, even if gallstones are observed on ultrasound examination, since they may be an incidental finding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376465651\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy-related conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy-related conditions that may be associated with RUQ or epigastric pain include severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome (ie, <strong>H</strong>emolysis, <strong>E</strong>levated <strong>L</strong>iver enzymes, <strong>L</strong>ow <strong>P</strong>latelet count), acute fatty liver, abruptio placentae, uterine rupture, and intra-amniotic infection. These conditions can usually be differentiated from gallstone disease by the clinical setting in which they occur and by obtaining the appropriate diagnostic studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute abdominal pain in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Preeclampsia/HELLP</strong></span> &ndash; Hypertension is the requisite criterion for preeclampsia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79977\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79977 \">table 2</a>) and is common in HELLP syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64665\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64665 \">table 3</a>). Thrombocytopenia is a requisite criterion for HELLP syndrome and is common in preeclampsia. Both disorders occur after 20 weeks of gestation. Gallbladder disease is not associated with either hypertension or thrombocytopenia and can occur anytime in pregnancy. Women with severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome can have elevated liver enzymes (typically at least twice normal), which can also occur with complicated gallstone disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute fatty liver</strong> &ndash; Acute fatty liver occurs in the second half of pregnancy, usually in the third trimester. The most frequent initial symptoms are nausea or vomiting (approximately 75 percent of patients), abdominal pain (particularly epigastric, 50 percent), anorexia, and jaundice. Serum aminotransferase elevations are usually higher in fatty liver than in gallbladder disease, ranging from modest increases to up to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span>. About one-half of patients have signs of preeclampsia at presentation or at some time during the course of illness. Hypoglycemia is a feature of severe acute fatty liver but is not present in preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, or gallbladder disease. Severe acute fatty liver is also characterized by renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation, which are not features of gallbladder disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-fatty-liver-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute fatty liver of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abruption</strong> &ndash; An acute abruption (ie, decidual hemorrhage leading to the premature separation of the placenta prior to delivery) classically presents with vaginal bleeding, uterine contractions, and <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/uterine</span> pain that is typically not limited to the RUQ or epigastrium. In severe cases, the fetal heart rate pattern is abnormal, and disseminated intravascular coagulation occurs. These features distinguish abruption from gallbladder disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental abruption: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uterine rupture</strong> &ndash; Most uterine ruptures occur in laboring women with a prior cesarean delivery or prior transmyometrial surgery. Signs and symptoms of uterine rupture can include an abnormal fetal heart rate tracing or fetal death, uterine tenderness, peritoneal irritation, vaginal bleeding, and shock. Uterine rupture prior to the onset of labor is rare and usually due to sharp or blunt abdominal trauma. This clinical setting is quite different from that in biliary disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-rupture-after-previous-cesarean-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine rupture after previous cesarean delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intra-amniotic infection</strong> &ndash; Signs and symptoms of intra-amniotic infection include fever, abdominal pain, uterine tenderness, leukocytosis, maternal and fetal tachycardia, and uterine contractions. Intra-amniotic infection is common after premature rupture of the fetal membranes. Women with acute cholecystitis have some of these signs and symptoms, but the location of pain is different <span class=\"nowrap\">(RUQ/epigastrium</span> versus uterine) and the fetal membranes are typically intact. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intra-amniotic-infection-clinical-chorioamnionitis-or-triple-i\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intra-amniotic infection (clinical chorioamnionitis or triple I)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415577526\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpregnancy-related conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpregnancy-related conditions include non-gallstone-related biliary disease, gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, hepatitis, and right-sided pneumonia. Of note, the location of the appendix migrates cephalad with the enlarging uterus as shown in the figure; thus, appendicitis may be more likely to present with RUQ pain in pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51960 \">figure 1</a>).

However, laboratory studies can be helpful for diagnosis of complicated gallbladder disease and for excluding conditions in differential diagnosis. Although the choice and order of testing varies depending upon the clinical presentation and suspicion of a particular diagnosis, the following are a reasonable baseline evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspartate <span class=\"nowrap\">aminotransferase/alanine</span> aminotransferase <span class=\"nowrap\">(AST/ALT),</span> total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (to evaluate for complicated gallbladder disease, HELLP [<strong>H</strong>emolysis, <strong>E</strong>levated <strong>L</strong>iver enzymes, <strong>L</strong>ow <strong>P</strong>latelet count], severe preeclampsia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum amylase and lipase (to evaluate for pancreatitis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count (to evaluate for infection, HELLP syndrome, severe preeclampsia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine protein (to evaluate for preeclampsia)</p><p/><p>Bilirubin and transaminases are not affected by normal pregnancy, while amylase and lipase levels have been reported to remain in the normal range or increase slightly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81137\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81137 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. Elevation in the serum total bilirubin is <strong>not</strong> common in uncomplicated cholecystitis, since biliary obstruction is limited to the gallbladder. However, mild elevations in serum aminotransferases and amylase, along with hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice, may occur as a result of the passage of small stones, sludge, or pus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

It should be noted that transaminases are elevated to at least twice normal in HELLP syndrome and can be elevated in severe preeclampsia, and the normal alkaline phosphatase level may be markedly elevated in pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81137\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81137 \">table 4</a>).

However, a left shift <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bandemia suggests infection. The platelet count may be slightly lower in normal pregnancy but generally remains within the normal range. A low platelet count suggests one of several causes of pregnancy-related thrombocytopenia (eg, HELLP, severe preeclampsia).

Experienced ultrasonographers can often make an accurate diagnosis of acute or chronic cholecystitis (sensitivity 85 to 95 percent, specificity 95 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is suggested by additional findings of gallbladder distention, gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and the ultrasonographic Murphy's sign.

In a review of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample that compared cholecystectomy in 9714 pregnant with 53,598 nonpregnant female controls from 1996 to 2006, pregnant women had higher rates of unadjusted surgical complications (10.7 versus 9.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In this study, pregnant women were more likely than nonpregnant women to undergo an open procedure; have multiple biliary diagnoses; be white; have Medicaid insurance; or be treated at hospitals that were rural, teaching, in the South, and that treated more high-risk obstetric volume. Pregnant women also were more likely to be treated by low-volume surgeons. After adjustment for patient and provider characteristics, pregnancy was not a significant predictor for having a surgical complication, but was an independent predictor for longer adjusted length of stay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H134513\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia and preoperative preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with uncomplicated gallbladder disease who are already receiving antibiotic therapy should be administered prophylactic antibiotics prior to cholecystectomy. Women with complicated gallbladder disease should already be receiving antibiotics, and should be re-dosed prior to surgery. Appropriate antibiotic choices are discussed above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H134355\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Other anesthetic and preoperative considerations in the pregnant patient, including positioning, monitoring, thromboprophylaxis, and pharmacologic management of preterm labor, are discussed in detail elsewhere.

A laparoscopic approach, in general, offers earlier recovery, reduced postoperative pain with a reduction in opioid usage, smaller incisions, and fewer wound complications such as hernia or surgical site infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. The surgical approach needs to consider uterine size, maternal body habitus, past surgical history, surgeon experience, and the availability of appropriate staff and equipment. A laparoscopic approach may provide better surgical exposure than the open approach during pregnancy and reduces the need to manipulate the uterus away from the operative field. However, if the laparoscopic procedure cannot be safely <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> effectively completed, the approach should be converted to an open cholecystectomy to avoid injury to surrounding structures. This reflects good judgment and should not be viewed as a failure or complication of the laparoscopic approach. Indications for choosing an open surgical approach or conversion to an open procedure are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-cholecystectomy#H24392458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open cholecystectomy&quot;, section on 'Indications for open surgery'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery#H104329859\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Conversion to an open procedure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-surgery-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reviews of older studies comparing open with laparoscopic cholecystectomy found no significant differences for maternal or fetal outcomes, dispelling the earlier notion that laparoscopic surgery was unsafe for pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/60,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,79</a>]. Laparoscopy was <strong>not</strong> associated with any increased risk for fetal mortality, low birth weight, preterm delivery, or low Apgar scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/80-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-86</a>]. A 2008 systematic review identified 20 studies (each including at least five patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy) during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among 195 patients, there were no maternal deaths, and the three fetal deaths were not attributable to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Four retrospective studies directly comparing open with laparoscopic cholecystectomy during pregnancy also did not identify any significant differences for maternal and fetal outcomes between the approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/67,78,83,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,78,83,87</a>]. The rate of conversion from open to laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 10 to 26 percent in these studies. A 2009 study of the National Inpatient Sample identified 9714 pregnant women who underwent cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The overall rates of maternal or fetal complications were 4.3 and 5.8 percent, respectively. Compared with pregnant women who underwent open cholecystectomy (n = 1069), pregnant women who underwent laparoscopic cholecystostomy (n = 8645) had significantly fewer surgical (10.1 versus 18.9 percent), maternal (3.8 versus 9.1 percent), and fetal complications (5 versus 11.3 percent). However, as noted above, the overall complication rates were high in this study, and demographics between the groups differed.</p><p>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be offered to women in any trimester requiring cholecystectomy, although it is technically more challenging near term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/57,83,84,88-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,83,84,88-94</a>]. In small reviews of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the third trimester, the number of cases with preterm contractions were 0 of 15, 2 of 5, and 5 of 6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/90,92,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,92,94</a>].

The patient should be placed slightly head-up and tilted to her left, allowing the uterus to fall away from the cava. For laparoscopic cholecystectomy, we prefer to use the open (Hasson) technique to gain initial access to the abdomen. An alternative during the later stages of pregnancy is subcostal access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Other aspects of laparoscopy in pregnancy are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Peritoneal access'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-surgery-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic surgery in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cannulas are generally placed in the usual locations, although as the uterus enlarges in the third trimester (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72006 \">figure 2</a>), it can be advantageous to move the epigastric port into the left upper quadrant to provide greater perspective (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56881\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56881 \">figure 3</a>). This modification should be determined after the pneumoperitoneum has been established. The gallbladder and the liver are retracted in the usual fashion, and the dissection is begun around the cystic duct-infundibular junction. Typically, an avascular area can be identified on the lateral aspect of this junction.</p><p>The remainder of the technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including intraoperative evaluation and laparoscopic management of common bile duct stones, is similar to surgery in nonpregnant patients, as is discussed in detail elsewhere and shown in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52727 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66207\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66207 \">figure 5</a>).

Patients are placed slightly head-up and tilted toward the left, allowing the uterus to fall away from the inferior vena cava. A subcostal incision is preferred, as it allows an easier approach to the gallbladder when the uterus is very large. The procedure is otherwise performed in standard fashion, as discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open cholecystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intraoperative cholangiography should be considered if the biliary anatomy is unclear <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if there is a substantial possibility of common duct stones. Radiation exposure to the fetus is not significant if shielded by a lead apron (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101246 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gallstones-in-pregnancy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. If available, intraoperative ultrasound of the bile duct can be performed as an alternative to cholangiography and has equivalent diagnostic accuracy for common duct stones in experienced hands.

Patients who have had laparoscopic surgery can usually be discharged home on the day of surgery or the following day unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as uterine contractions, vaginal bleeding, pain, or unremitting nausea. A two- to four-day stay is usually necessary after open surgery.</p><p>Opioids and antiemetics can be used, as needed, to control postoperative pain and nausea. Analgesic requirements should be met in consultation with the obstetrician. Short-term use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or narcotics is safe in pregnancy, although prolonged use of these medications (&gt;2 weeks) postoperatively should be avoided. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided, especially after 32 weeks of gestation, because they may cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus. Epidural analgesia is an option for postoperative pain control after an open procedure and carries less risk of opioid-induced hypoventilation when compared with intravenous opioids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2029515553\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The major independent risk factor for gallstones is prepregnancy obesity. (See <a href=\"#H210627445\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H140710445\" class=\"local\">'Personal risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of gallstone disease during pregnancy is not significantly different than in the nongestational state. Among pregnant women who develop gallstones or have sludge, fewer than 2 percent develop symptoms. In most patients, recurrent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain (biliary colic) is the first symptom related to gallstones. Less frequently, initial manifestations may be related to complications of gallstones (acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, gallstone pancreatitis). (See <a href=\"#H31120837\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Criteria for diagnosis of gallstone-related diseases in pregnancy are the same as in nonpregnant women. Ultrasonography is a reliable and safe method for identifying stones in the gallbladder. Common bile duct stones are poorly identified with transabdominal ultrasound. Other imaging that may be useful and is considered safe in pregnancy includes magnetic resonance imaging, cholescintigraphy, and cholangiography (endoscopic, laparoscopic). (See <a href=\"#H743428\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies can be helpful for diagnosing complicated gallbladder disease and excluding conditions in differential diagnosis. Routine laboratory studies are generally normal in patients with uncomplicated biliary colic. Significant elevations of the transaminases and alkaline phosphatase or direct bilirubin should raise the possibility of a common bile duct stone, cholangitis, or Mirizzi syndrome, keeping in mind that the normal ranges for some laboratory values are altered in pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81137\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81137 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H127317\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In pregnant women with RUQ or epigastric pain, pregnancy-related conditions must be considered, even if gallstones are observed on ultrasound examination, since they may be an incidental finding. These conditions can usually be differentiated from gallstone disease using the clinical setting in which they occur. (See <a href=\"#H215897\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis of pregnant women with RUQ or epigastric pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of pregnant patients with gallstone disease is supportive and includes pain control, intravenous fluid therapy, and, for selected patients, antibiotic therapy (acute cholecystitis, evidence of biliary infection). Additional imaging and repeat laboratory studies are indicated to assess for potential complications if symptoms worsen. (See <a href=\"#H7581628\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholecystectomy can be performed safely and effectively during any trimester of pregnancy. Pregnancy alone does not appear to increase postoperative morbidity for cholecystectomy. However, cholecystectomy can be technically challenging near term. (See <a href=\"#H133717\" class=\"local\">'Cholecystectomy during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For pregnant patients with a first episode of biliary colic, we suggest initial supportive care (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For recurrent biliary colic during pregnancy, we suggest cholecystectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H420893547\" class=\"local\">'Biliary colic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For pregnant patients with acute cholecystitis, we suggest cholecystectomy during their initial hospitalization rather than conservative therapy alone or interval cholecystectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Prompt surgical intervention decreases relapse rates and hospital readmissions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If biliary colic or acute cholecystitis occurs near term, we make every effort to avoid surgery. Once the woman has delivered her baby, we wait six weeks to perform cholecystectomy to allow her to recover from the delivery, bond with the infant, and regain her strength.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urgent or emergent intervention (cholecystectomy, biliary tract or gallbladder drainage) is indicated for patients with gallstone disease and signs of sepsis, gangrene or perforation, or for patients who develop intractable pain or fever while being observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnant patients who require cholecystectomy, we suggest a laparoscopic approach rather than open surgery, when feasible and available (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If a laparoscopic procedure cannot be safely <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> effectively completed, an open cholecystectomy should be performed.
