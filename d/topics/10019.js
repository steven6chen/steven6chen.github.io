The most common are neoplasms that are collectively referred to as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). They are most often located in the stomach and proximal small intestine, but can occur in any portion of the alimentary tract and occasionally in the omentum, mesentery, and peritoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>A far less common group of mesenchymal GI tract neoplasms is comprised of a spectrum of tumors that are identical to those that might arise in the soft tissues throughout the rest of the body. These include lipomas, liposarcomas, leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, desmoid tumors, schwannomas, and peripheral nerve sheath tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Local treatment options for GIST, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas of the GI tract will be discussed here. The epidemiology, classification, molecular pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagnostic workup of GISTs, leiomyomas, and leiomyosarcomas of the GI tract, and the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), both in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting, and for patients with metastatic GIST, are discussed elsewhere.

However, a biopsy is preferred to confirm the diagnosis if metastatic disease is suspected or if preoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> is considered prior to attempted resection in a patient who has a large locally advanced lesion thought to represent a GIST.

Although these small GISTs may be followed endoscopically until they grow or become symptomatic, the optimal frequency of follow-up and specific risks of this strategy is uncertain. Successful endoscopic resection is reported, but it remains controversial because of the risk of positive margins, tumor spillage, and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Because GISTs are submucosal, standard techniques of endoscopic mucosal resection do not necessarily extend deep enough into the submucosal tissue to guarantee removal of all the deep tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An algorithmic approach to management of gastric GISTs based upon size and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) appearance has been proposed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66521\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef66521 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This approach has been adopted by the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7727\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a> for gastric GISTs but not those at other sites in the GI tract. When endoscopic assessment is not possible, excision is the standard approach. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'GIST and leiomyoma'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for potentially resectable tumors; however, initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> may be preferred if a tumor is borderline resectable, or if resection would necessitate extensive organ disruption.

Segmental resection of the stomach or intestine should be performed with the goal of achieving negative resection margins. Wider resection of uninvolved tissue is of no additional benefit. However, peritumoral as opposed to segmental resection should be avoided, as there is a higher risk of local recurrence, particularly with leiomyosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Routine lymphadenectomy is unnecessary because nodal metastases are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although they may appear ominous on CT, GISTs often project extraluminally from the stomach or small intestine and displace rather than invade adjacent organs. They can often be lifted away from surrounding structures, although in some cases, en bloc resection is necessary because of dense adhesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At laparotomy, the abdomen should be thoroughly explored, with particular attention to the peritoneal surfaces and liver to exclude metastatic spread. The tumor should be handled carefully to avoid rupture, which markedly increases the risk of a disease recurrence.

The management of a positive margin according to the final pathology report is not well defined and depends on whether the surgeon believes the finding accurately reflects the surgical procedure that was undertaken [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. Although patients who undergo a microscopically incomplete resection may be at greater risk for a locoregional recurrence, other factors such as tumor grade and size may play a more significant role in determining the risk of recurrence. The risks and benefits of reexcision versus initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> must be carefully considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Data from the landmark ACOSOG Z9001 trial provide good evidence that one year of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> therapy is effective in reducing GIST recurrence within the first year of therapy, and imatinib is approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States for adjuvant treatment of completely resected GISTs &ge;3 cm in size.

The tumors appear as rounded submucosal lesions with intact overlying mucosa and feel rubbery when gently palpated with the endoscope. Ulceration or bleeding is uncommon.</p><p>The histologic distinction between well-differentiated leiomyosarcoma and leiomyoma can be difficult. Endoscopic resection of all small submucosal tumors has been suggested to firmly establish their benignity. In one series of 62 patients with submucosal tumors of the esophagus, tumors less than 2 cm that were polypoid or had at least a round protrusion with moderate elevation were selected for endoscopic snare polypectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/local-treatment-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-leiomyomas-and-leiomyosarcomas-of-the-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Larger tumors, or those having only mild elevation, were treated by complete stripping of the overlying mucosa followed by enucleation using an electrocautery snare and a coagulation electrode. Tumors were completely resected in all but one patient, and there were no serious complications. Histologically, there were 56 leiomyomas, four granular cell tumors, one neurogenic tumor, and one cyst.</p><p>Despite these encouraging results, no malignant tumors were encountered in this series (with the exception of the granular cell tumors, which can be malignant), and the risk of complications is uncertain. The safety of this technique depends upon the endoscopist's experience.</p><p>A more conservative approach for small asymptomatic lesions that lack features suggesting malignancy is to perform follow-up examinations using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Follow-up studies consist of repeat EUS at six and 12 months. If no changes occur within one year, the follow-up intervals can be lengthened. Surgical removal should be performed if the tumor becomes symptomatic, enlarges to &gt;1 cm, or shows structural changes. Snare polypectomy should be reserved for lesions with mucosal elevations that meet the previously described criteria.

They differ clinically and pathogenetically from true leiomyosarcomas (which are very rare in the GI tract and predominantly found in the stomach) and leiomyomas, which occur predominantly in the esophagus, colon and rectum. The majority of mesenchymal tumors of the stomach are GISTs while the majority of smooth muscle tumors in the esophagus are leiomyomas.
