Thus, each variant is generally limited to a single pedigree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Exceptions include the following mutations, which are seen more commonly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin K&ouml;ln (HBB val98met), which has been detected in several different pedigrees and geographic locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Mutations conferring instability can also affect the gamma globin and delta globin chains. Delta globin chain instability does not have a clinical phenotype because the delta globin containing hemoglobin (HbA2) is present at very low concentration. Unstable gamma globin variants can cause neonatal hemolytic anemia that resolves as fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is replaced by adult hemoglobin in the first months of life. In addition to instability, many of these variants also have increased or decreased oxygen affinity as the mutations may interfere with the transitions of the hemoglobin tetramer between oxygenated (R) to deoxygenated (T) states, in addition to causing instability. Auto-oxidation and methemoglobinemia are also common features. In the discussion below, the affected globin chain is designated by the gene name followed by the amino acid substitution. As an example, HBB ala138pro refers to an alanine to proline substitution at position 138 in the beta globin chain.</p><p>The mechanisms that contribute to hemoglobin instability vary, and these are outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H9081451\" class=\"local\">'Altered globin folding/assembly'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Altered heme-globin interactions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hyperunstable variants'</a> below.)</p><p>The majority of unstable hemoglobins are inherited as autosomal dominant traits, and affected individuals are heterozygous for the mutation; however, homozygosity may rarely also occur, especially for the more common variants or in populations with a high degree of consanguinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9081451\"><span class=\"h2\">Altered globin folding/assembly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some mutations causing unstable hemoglobins affect globin folding or assembly. This may be at the level of the secondary structure (initial folding of the protein into an alpha-helix), tertiary structure (overall three-dimensional shape of the globin chain), or quaternary structure (interaction between globin subunits) of the hemoglobin molecule. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 75 percent of the hemoglobin protein is in the form of an alpha-helix, and disruption of this secondary structure can reduce the solubility of the subunit. Unstable hemoglobin variants can result from the introduction of proline in the helical structure, the substitution of glycine by a mutation in invariant positions in the interhelical bends, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by amino acid insertions and deletions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twenty-seven unstable hemoglobin variants involve the introduction of a proline residue. Proline residues disrupt the alpha-helix of the globin chain, except when present at the ends of the helical section. Alpha-helical regions of the globin subunits must be folded so that the hemoglobin tetramer can assume its tight globular configuration. An example of a variant that disrupts this folding is hemoglobin Brockton (HBB ala138pro), an abnormality that is associated with mild anemia. Crystallographic examination showed that the tertiary structure was disrupted in the vicinity of the mutated residue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substitutions in the amino acid residues that point inward can occur with no change in solubility as long as the incoming residue is not charged, is not bulky, or there is no loss of critical nonpolar residues that prevent water from entering the interior of the molecule.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Introduction of charged residues in the interior of the hemoglobin molecule or loss of intersubunit contact hydrogen bonds or salt bridges in the alpha1beta1 contact area makes the protein unstable. This area of contact is normally very strong and difficult to dissociate. When a substitution weakens the contact area, it promotes dissociation of the alpha1beta1 chains into monomers, loosening their heme-globin interaction and favoring methemoglobin formation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Altered heme-globin interactions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin E (HbE), formed as a result of a splice site mutation in exon 1 of the beta globin gene, is an important and common variant in Southeast Asia. Although it is unstable at high temperatures, the pathophysiology of HbE disorders is a result of reduced synthesis rather than instability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of the thalassemic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Hb E: A special case'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Altered heme-globin interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heme binding to globin is important for the oxygen binding properties and the stability and solubility of the molecule. Several of the mutations involving residues with defined interactions with the heme groups that result in protein instability are depicted in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58767 \">figure 1</a>). These include substitutions that introduce a charged side chain into the heme pocket where a nonpolar side chain existed previously, deletions involving residues that directly interact with heme, and non-tyrosine substitutions of the proximal histidine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Observations in patients with hemoglobin K&ouml;ln and hemoglobin Zurich illustrate these mechanisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemoglobin K&ouml;ln</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoglobin K&ouml;ln is the most frequently diagnosed unstable hemoglobin in the Western world. It is characterized by mild anemia, reticulocytosis, splenomegaly, and pigmenturia; it comprises 10 to 25 percent of the total hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The presence of the hemoglobin K&ouml;ln mutation at a CpG dinucleotide leads to deamidation of cytosine to thymine, perhaps accounting for its high incidence compared with other unstable variants. This mutation involves a residue in the heme pocket (FG5) that is very close to the proximal histidine (F8His) that is involved in a valency bond with heme iron.</p><p>The functional properties of hemoglobin K&ouml;ln involve a high oxygen affinity in the absence of compensatory erythrocytosis and easy heme dissociation. Of special interest are the abnormalities in the membrane of erythrocytes containing hemoglobin K&ouml;ln. When the patient's red blood cells (RBCs) are exposed to hydrogen peroxide stress, they produce twice the malonylaldehyde (a lipid peroxidation product) than normal RBCs. Two sorts of abnormal membrane aggregates have been found in those patients with hemoglobin K&ouml;ln who have undergone splenectomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A disulfide bond between membrane band 3 (also known as anion exchanger [AE]-1) and globin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggregates of spectrin and other membrane components, which have an amino acid composition similar to normal membranes exposed to malonylaldehyde.</p><p/><p>Membrane-associated aggregates are thought to reduce the deformability of hemoglobin K&ouml;ln erythrocytes, thereby contributing to the hemolysis. In addition, the denatured hemoglobin protein co-clusters with the RBC membrane band 3, resulting in increased binding of autoantibodies against band 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This process may be important physiologically in aged RBCs when hemoglobin begins to denature; it promotes recognition by macrophages and contributes to the removal of senescent cells.</p><p>Red cells containing hemoglobin K&ouml;ln have a green fluorescent pigment due to dipyrroles, the same pigment found in the pigmented urine of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The partial lack of heme molecules in some of the tetramers of hemoglobin K&ouml;ln makes the use of pulse oximetry unreliable in these and some other patients with unstable hemoglobin variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1807594\" class=\"local\">'Other manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1807938\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemoglobin Zurich</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In hemoglobin Zurich (HBB his63arg), substitution of the distal histidine in the beta globin chain enlarges the space available for ligand binding around the iron, fundamentally modifying its ligand properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This steric change has little effect on the binding of oxygen to iron, but it increases the affinity for carbon monoxide (CO). Carboxyhemoglobin levels are very high in smokers with hemoglobin Zurich due to the CO content of tobacco smoke, but they are also elevated in nonsmokers who carry the mutation due to endogenous CO production from heme catabolism. CO stabilizes the hemoglobin tetramer, and this partially protective effect of carboxyhemoglobin Zurich reduces the rate of hemolysis and the frequency of Heinz body formation, especially among smokers with the hemoglobin Zurich mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Individuals heterozygous for hemoglobin Zurich usually have normal hemoglobin levels with little hemolysis, but they have a special susceptibility to hemolytic crisis induced by oxidant agents like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfanilamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfanilamide</a>. This is because the increased size of the heme pocket in the hemoglobin of these individuals allows oxidant agents to enter the heme pockets and directly oxidize heme, producing methemoglobin at levels reported to be as high as 40 percent. As noted above, smoking is protective due to stabilization of the tetramer by CO.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperunstable variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some hemoglobins are so unstable that they are either barely detectable or undetectable in the hemolysate. These rare hemoglobins are called hyperunstable hemoglobin variants; they have also been called thalassemic hemoglobinopathies because of the rapid destruction of the variant globin chain.</p><p>Hyperunstable variants presumably are synthesized normally but are destroyed rapidly after synthesis because of extreme instability, creating the phenotype of a dominantly inherited thalassemia. Patients with these variants are heterozygous for the mutated globin but have a phenotype of severe thalassemia.</p><p>Examples of hyperunstable variants include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoglobin Indianapolis</strong> &ndash; Hemoglobin Indianapolis (HBB leu106arg, previously identified as cys112arg) was one of the first examples of a hyperunstable hemoglobin phenotype to be described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Hemoglobin Indianapolis was not detectable in the hemolysate but its beta globin chain could be detected by biosynthetic means and had a calculated half-life of less than 10 minutes. The proband and his daughter were transfusion dependent with all the features of severe beta thalassemia. Unlike the typical severe thalassemia, the phenotype was inherited in a dominant manner. Erythrocyte membrane damage by the labile beta globin chain and unpaired alpha-globin chains were thought to account for the severe phenotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoglobin Petah Tikva</strong> &ndash; Hemoglobin Petah Tikva (HBA ala110asp) was found in two unrelated Iraqi Jewish children, the phenotype appeared to be an alpha thalassemia with hematologic characteristics of mild hemoglobin H disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias#H3786212779\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Hemoglobin H disease'</a>), suggesting that the children had inherited only a single normal alpha-chain gene instead of the usual four [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The hemoglobin variant could not be separated by electrophoresis, but the abnormal alpha-chain was detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The hemolysate was unstable, and the precipitated material was enriched in the mutant globin chain. Each child had one parent with alpha thalassemia trait and one parent who was heterozygous for hemoglobin Petah Tikva. Each affected patient appeared to be compound heterozygotes for both alpha thalassemia trait and hemoglobin Petah Tikva.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Synthesis studies in heterozygotes for hemoglobin Petah Tikva revealed that only traces of the Petah Tikva alpha-globin were synthesized by reticulocytes. In the compound heterozygous patients, both mutated and normal alpha-chains were synthesized by bone marrow erythroid precursors at rates related to their concentration in blood. Thus, the phenotype of these patients was the consequence of the triad of alpha thalassemia, the unstable Petah Tikva alpha-globin variant, and its premature termination of synthesis during erythroid differentiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoglobin Bristol-Alesha</strong> &ndash; Hemoglobin Bristol-Alesha is caused by a GTG to ATG mutation at codon 67 in HBB, resulting in a change from val67met that is followed by post-translational oxidation of the encoded methionine and subsequent conversion to aspartic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Four cases of this variant have been described. All of the affected individuals had hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly, and all received transfusions. In one case, hemolytic anemia was enhanced following splenectomy at four years of age. Splenectomy caused accumulation of abnormal beta globin chains with a markedly increased proportion of beta67val. It was speculated that the high fraction of the beta67met molecule caused the extreme hemoglobin instability, resulting in a thalassemic hyperunstable hemoglobinopathy and very severe clinical findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemoglobin Toms River</strong> &ndash; Hemoglobin Toms River (HBG2 val67met-asp) is an unstable HbF variant with some features similar to hemoglobin Bristol-Alesha, but the abnormality occurs in the A gamma globin gene. It was first identified in a neonate with cyanosis and anemia; her father also had neonatal cyanosis and anemia, and as an adult he had well-compensated hemolytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and reticulocytosis (20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Her father did not have measurable HbF so the cause of hemolysis was unclear. It was speculated that the encoded mutation to methionine was responsible for cyanosis, and the post-translational oxidative conversion to aspartate caused instability. The phenotype was not as severe as that of hemoglobin Bristol-Alesha, likely due to the lower concentration of hemoglobin Toms River in erythrocytes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604233\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF HEMOLYSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11446176\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoglobin precipitation and Heinz body formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Denaturation of hemoglobin leads to its precipitation in the red blood cell (RBC). As a general rule, weakening of the heme-globin bond will accelerate hemoglobin denaturation.</p><p>Heinz bodies are intraerythrocytic hemoglobin precipitates that form when hemoglobin denatures and produces hemichromes. Hemichromes are molecules generated when the heme dissociates from the heme pocket and rebinds elsewhere in the globin molecule after the alpha or beta chains have undergone some degree of uncoiling or denaturation. Formation of irreversible hemichromes appears to be an indispensable stage in the formation of Heinz bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Heinz bodies adhere at least partially to the cytosolic (internal) surface of the RBC membrane by hydrophobic interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Band 3, one of the most abundant erythrocyte transmembrane proteins, has a highly glycosylated portion on the external surface of the RBC, a hydrophobic portion spanning the lipid bilayer, and an N-terminal cytosolic domain that has two conformational independent portions separated by a protease sensitive hinge region. The N-terminal domain is highly negatively charged and has a high content of proline and other amino acid residues that do not accommodate well in an alpha-helix. Hemoglobin and hemichromes bind the most N-terminal portion of the band 3 cytosolic domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The band 3 cytosolic domain can thread into the positively charged central cavity of hemoglobin, which is why this domain preferentially and reversibly binds deoxyhemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Heinz bodies generally are cleared by splenic macrophages as part of their normal reticuloendothelial function. This provides a possible explanation for the absence of Heinz bodies in some individuals with unstable hemoglobin variants. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Blood smear and Heinz body preparation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605804\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all of the unstable hemoglobin variants are sufficiently abnormal to result in hemolytic anemia. As a result, not all patients will have hemolysis; in those who do have hemolysis, it may be mild or severe. Hemolysis is typically both intravascular and extravascular.</p><p>The mechanisms are several-fold:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formation of Heinz bodies may lead to reduced deformability, which in turn may cause RBCs to be trapped preferentially in the spleen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heinz bodies may also cause adjacent portions of the RBC membrane to be excised in the spleen (a process known as &quot;pitting&quot;), leading to the formation of &quot;bite&quot; or &quot;blister&quot; cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Cycles of membrane loss convert RBCs into spherocytes, which are more rigid than normal RBCs and hence have a shorter lifespan.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free heme that becomes liberated from an unstable hemoglobin may cause heme iron to become decompartmentalized, in turn damaging the RBC membrane and RBC proteins, including hemoglobin. This may result from several intermediates, including peroxidized membrane components, generation of free radicals, methemoglobin formation, and hemoglobin denaturation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605892\"><span class=\"h2\">Pigmenturia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pigmenturia is a color change in the urine due to the accumulation of fluorescent compounds in the plasma. These are thought to be dipyrrole methenes of the mesobilifuscin group. The origin of these fluorescent compounds is not clear. Their structure, two pyrrole rings still bound to each other by a methenyl bridge, suggests the malfunctioning of methenyl oxygenase, the enzyme involved in the breaking of -CH= bridges. Fluorescent dipyrroles are also present in Heinz bodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

By contrast, individuals with unstable beta globin variants may appear at birth not to have a hemolytic anemia and may develop progressive hemolysis during the first year of life as beta globin chain production increases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oxygen affinity</strong> &ndash; The degree of anemia associated with an unstable hemoglobin variant may be affected by the oxygen affinity of the hemoglobin produced, which in turn can shift the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve and lead to more or less erythropoietin production.

Hemolytic crisis upon exposure to oxidant drugs has been seen with hemoglobin Zurich, hemoglobin Hasharon, hemoglobin Shepards Bush, and hemoglobin Peterborough. These crises are generally self-limited. Implicated medications are similar to those that cause hemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. However, the association is poorly documented in many cases.

As an example, the disease manifestations vary widely in adults with hemoglobin Hasharon and hemoglobin Zurich, from mild hemolytic anemia to no hemolysis at all. The presence of an unstable beta globin variant as a compound heterozygote with a beta thalassemia mutation will increase the concentration of the unstable variant, making hemolysis more readily detectable. Similarly, unstable alpha globin variants will be higher in the presence of alpha thalassemia. Some variants interact abnormally with alpha hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP), which causes their instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Epistatic effects of other non-linked modifier genes might also be responsible for these differences in carriers of the same globin-gene mutation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1807536\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemolytic anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemolytic anemia is the chief clinical feature of unstable hemoglobins.

Some individuals may have chronic hemolysis, while others may have an abrupt increase in hemolysis over steady state levels following an acute infection or exposure to oxidant medications. (See <a href=\"#H11446779\" class=\"local\">'Clinical variability'</a> above.)</p><p>As with other forms of hemolytic anemia, the reticulocyte count is elevated unless there is a concomitant vitamin or mineral deficiency that impairs hematopoiesis. The haptoglobin is often low, the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be increased, and the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT) is negative because there is no immune component. The white blood cell (WBC) count and platelet count are usually normal but may be increased. The peripheral blood smear may show a variety of abnormal RBC morphologies including bite cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790 \">picture 1</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spherocytes.

The clinical presentation is of a slight to moderate, usually normocytic anemia that may be accompanied by splenomegaly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pigmenturia</strong> &ndash; Some unstable hemoglobin variants produce pigmenturia, the severity of which is unrelated to the severity of hemolysis. As examples, pigmenturia can be seen in individuals with hemoglobin K&ouml;ln who have severe hemolysis and in individuals with hemoglobin Zurich who have very mild hemolysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Less common complications related to NO depletion</strong> &ndash; Several other complications may occur due to depletion of nitric oxide (NO); these are less common than the manifestations listed above.

This may cause symptoms of hypoxemia out of proportion to the degree (if any) of anemia, and the blood may appear dark red or chocolate colored. At low levels of methemoglobinemia (eg, &le;20 percent), oxygen saturation may appear normal by pulse oximetry. At higher levels of methemoglobinemia (eg, &gt;20 percent), oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be low but will still underestimate the degree of true oxygen desaturation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spuriously low pulse oximetry readings</strong> &ndash; An unexpectedly low oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry can be caused by certain unstable hemoglobins such as hemoglobin K&ouml;ln.

For most of these, the arterial blood gas will give a normal SaO<sub>2</sub> reading. An exception is hemoglobins that have intrinsically low oxygen affinity, for which pulse oximetry will give an accurately low SaO<sub>2</sub>. Variants with low oxygen affinity may have normal or even increased tissue oxygen delivery, and the benefit of their identification is in avoiding other extensive evaluations.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604330\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of an unstable hemoglobin variant is suspected in a patient with unexplained hemolytic anemia.

In individuals with an unstable hemoglobin variant, the other cell lines are unaffected and the reticulocyte count is increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional CBC findings consistent with an unstable hemoglobin variant include normocytic anemia and increased red cell distribution width (RDW), especially if there is a reticulocytosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients may also have other findings of hemolytic anemia on routine evaluations, including increased bilirubin, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), decreased haptoglobin, and pigmenturia, depending on the severity of intravascular hemolysis. Tests for autoimmune hemolysis such as the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT) typically are negative in patients with an unstable hemoglobin.

The RBCs may be hypochromic leading to a thalassemia-like picture, especially with the hyperunstable variants (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Hyperunstable variants'</a> above). Howell-Jolly bodies may be seen, especially in individuals who have had a splenectomy, and nucleated RBCs may be present, especially if hemolysis is severe. Importantly, these abnormalities on the peripheral blood smear are not specific for unstable hemoglobins and may be seen with various other conditions associated with hemolysis. (See <a href=\"#H1807676\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A Heinz body stain, if available, may be helpful for cases of suspected unstable hemoglobin variants, provided that the laboratory has the expertise to interpret the results correctly. Heinz bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790 \">picture 1</a>) are RBC inclusions caused by denatured hemoglobin proteins (see <a href=\"#H11446176\" class=\"local\">'Hemoglobin precipitation and Heinz body formation'</a> above). Their presence is consistent with a diagnosis of an unstable hemoglobin but not required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Detection of Heinz bodies requires incubation of RBCs with a supravital stain such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, crystal violet, or brilliant cresyl blue. Heinz bodies appear as single or multiple pale purple inclusions that are 2 microns in diameter or less; they frequently appear to be attached to the cell membrane. The test is inexpensive and can be performed rapidly, but many laboratories do not have experience with evaluation and interpretation. Heinz bodies may be found in freshly drawn samples of peripheral blood but, in most cases, incubation for 24 hours in the absence of glucose is required for them to form. Due to the extreme variability inherent in this test, a normal blood sample as a control should always be run simultaneously.

Routine preventive measures and age-appropriate vaccinations are used; these are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-prevention-precautions-for-preventing-transmission-of-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection prevention: Precautions for preventing transmission of infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaccines for children</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-immunizations-for-children-and-adolescents-overview#H645243885\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard immunizations for children and adolescents: Overview&quot;, section on 'Routine schedule'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaccines for adults</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard immunizations for nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Prompt evaluation and treatment of infections is also appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605623\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with severe hemolysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aplastic crisis (eg, in the setting of parvovirus B19 infection) may develop anemia severe enough to require red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. These decisions are made on a case-by-case basis depending on the severity of symptoms, anemia, and bone marrow suppression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Splenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The question of splenectomy arises in patients with more severe hemolysis. Although the spleen plays an important pathophysiologic role in the destruction of Heinz body-containing red cells, the potential benefit of splenectomy must be weighed against the increased susceptibility to pneumococcal infections, risks of thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension, and the need for pneumococcal vaccines as well as prophylactic penicillin when splenectomy is performed during childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-spherocytosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary spherocytosis&quot;, section on 'Splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p>On balance, splenectomy is often beneficial for the most severe cases, and partial correction of the anemia has been achieved in some instances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, for unknown reasons, splenectomy does not always reduce hemolysis or anemia.</p><p>Thromboembolic events have also been noted following splenectomy for unstable hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unstable-hemoglobin-variants/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The etiology of the increased tendency to thrombosis in congenital hemolytic anemia is likely to be multifactorial, but postsplenectomy erythrocytosis, RBC procoagulant-containing microparticles, and post-splenectomy thrombocytosis may play some role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605231\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing of family members and genetic counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Family members of an individual with an unstable hemoglobin documented by genetic analysis may be tested by standard hematologic evaluation such as complete blood count (CBC) and review of the peripheral blood smear, with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) if the picture is consistent with an unstable hemoglobin and that hemoglobin is separable by HPLC.</p><p>As noted above, the majority of unstable hemoglobins are transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63306\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63306 \">figure 2</a>).

Hemoglobin K&ouml;ln and hemoglobin Zurich have been reported in several families, and hemoglobin Hasharon is seen in individuals with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. (See <a href=\"#H1807171\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstable hemoglobin variants include mutations in the alpha, beta, gamma, or delta globin chains. These cause instability of the globin proteins by affecting the folding, assembly, or subunit interactions in the globin molecules <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the interactions between heme and globin. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Genetic variants and their effect on protein structure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Denaturation of hemoglobin leads to precipitation in the red blood cell (RBC). This in turn may cause Heinz body formation and extravascular hemolysis as the spleen clears abnormal RBCs. (See <a href=\"#H604233\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology of hemolysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical clinical manifestations of an unstable hemoglobin variant include varying degrees of hemolysis, hemolytic anemia, and manifestations of hemolysis such as gallstones, splenomegaly, and pigmenturia. Sources of clinical variability include the globin chain that is affected, whether the mutation alters the oxygen affinity of the hemoglobin, environmental factors such as smoking and oxidant medications, and other unidentified modifiers. (See <a href=\"#H1807453\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of an unstable hemoglobin variant is suspected in a patient with unexplained hemolytic anemia. Most patients present in childhood or adolescence, but many are diagnosed as adults because chronic mild hemolytic anemia was unappreciated or attributed to another condition. Initial testing includes routine laboratory studies for hemolytic anemia, review of the peripheral blood smear, and Heinz body preparation (if the laboratory has appropriate expertise). Specialized testing is done if the initial evaluation does not reveal another cause and in family members of individuals with a documented unstable variant. In many patients with suspected unstable variant, we proceed directly to genetic testing, as this is the most definitive means of establishing the diagnosis and characterizing the variant. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of an unstable hemoglobin variant includes a number of other causes of inherited and acquired hemolytic anemia, especially those associated with Heinz bodies, which are described above. (See <a href=\"#H1807676\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of a patient with an unstable hemoglobin variant is largely supportive and includes avoidance of oxidant drugs when possible, prevention and prompt treatment of infections, and possibly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation. Less commonly, transfusions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splenectomy may be appropriate.
