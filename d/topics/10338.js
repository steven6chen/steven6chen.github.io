Aortic valve replacement is generally required to treat symptomatic aortic stenosis except in selected young adults who may benefit from percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty. Aortic valve replacement is generally the definitive therapy for severe aortic regurgitation.

There are many different phenotypes of bicuspid aortic valve aortic enlargement (bicuspid valve &quot;aortopathy&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-bicuspid-aortic-valve-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most common site of aortic dilation is at the ascending aorta and monitoring by transthoracic echocardiography is often inadequate at this level unless high right parasternal views are obtained. Echocardiography should be performed at intervals, based upon the lesion requiring greatest frequency of surveillance among aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, and dilation of the aorta. The rate of aortic growth in bicuspid aortic valve patients is variable, ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year,</span> depending upon patient characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-bicuspid-aortic-valve-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Higher rates of growth are observed in older adults and those with larger aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-bicuspid-aortic-valve-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Development of significant aortic stenosis is much more common than development of significant aortic regurgitation.</p><p>Earlier re-evaluation (beyond the below recommended surveillance) is indicated for changes in symptoms or examination and for hemodynamic assessment related to pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-a-bicuspid-aortic-valve\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with a bicuspid aortic valve&quot;</a>.) Of note, although surveillance of the aorta is based upon aortic diameter, other factors (eg, genetic factors, hemodynamic effects) likely contribute to the risk of acute aortic events (eg, aortic dissection and aortic rupture) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-bicuspid-aortic-valve-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The following

Both guidelines recommend measuring the aortic annulus at the hinge points of the aortic valve leaflets using the inner edge to inner edge.</p><p>If the aortic root and ascending aorta above the sinotubular junction cannot be adequately visualized by transthoracic echocardiography, noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or contrast CT is recommended. On MRI or contrast CT images, the external diameter is used. In patients requiring serial imaging, MRI is preferred to avoid repeated radiation exposure. In patients with impaired renal function, the risk of iodinated intravenous contrast for contrast CT should be considered.</p><p>Gadolinium contrast agent administration is generally not required for determination of aorta size by MRI.

In the setting of normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, patients generally remain asymptomatic as aortic stenosis progresses until the valve area approaches 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>, the peak gradient exceeds 64 mmHg, or the mean gradient exceeds 40 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95224\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95224 \">table 2</a>). Some remain asymptomatic despite a critically stenosed aortic valve and markedly elevated aortic valve gradients, while others develop symptoms when the aortic stenosis is less severe. Indexing the aortic valve area to body size is important to correctly determine appropriate thresholds. Patients with mixed aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation may develop symptoms at larger valve areas. Once symptomatic aortic stenosis develops, the survival rate decreases markedly, and there is an increased risk of sudden death.

These studies did not specifically examine bicuspid aortic valve aneurysms. A study of 133 patients found that the five-year risk of rupture was 0 percent for aneurysms less than 4.0 cm, compared with 16 and 31 percent for aneurysms 4.0 to 5.9 and &ge;6.0 cm, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-bicuspid-aortic-valve-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In another series of 370 patients, the median diameter at the time of rupture or dissection was 5.9 cm for ascending aneurysms and 7.2 cm for descending aneurysms; a diameter greater than 6.0 cm increased the risk of rupture or dissection by 25 percent for an ascending aneurysm, while a diameter greater than 7.0 cm increased the risk by 37 percent in a descending aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-bicuspid-aortic-valve-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a prospective study of 721 patients, the rate of dissection or rupture were 2, 3, and 7 percent per year for aneurysms less than 5.0 cm, 5.0 to 5.9 cm, and &ge;6.0 cm, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-bicuspid-aortic-valve-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Among patients with aneurysms &ge;6.0 cm, the combined endpoint of rupture, dissection, or death occurred at a rate of 15.6 percent per year. The five-year rate of survival in patients with aneurysms &gt;6.0 cm was 56 percent. In patients who did not undergo surgery (diameter not specified), 54 percent were alive at five years. In comparison, elective surgery restored survival to a rate similar to a matched control population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of thoracic aortic aneurysm in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the dissection rate increases with aortic diameter, most patients who present with acute aortic dissection have smaller aneurysms because there are many more individuals in the population with thoracic aortic aneurysm diameters between 4.0 and 5.5 cm. This was demonstrated in a review of 591 patients with type A dissection (mean diameter 5.3 cm) enrolled in the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissection (IRAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-adults-with-bicuspid-aortic-valve-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Nearly 60 percent of patients had diameters &lt;5.5 cm, and 40 percent had aortic diameters &lt;5.0 cm. Current recommendations for elective surgery include patients with ascending aortic aneurysm size between 5.0 to 6.0 cm.

Late aortic aneurysm formation depended upon the aortic size at the time of valve replacement.

In this group, the freedom from adverse aortic events at 10 and 15 years was 88 and 70 percent, respectively.
