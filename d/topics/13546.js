It is also frequently associated with postnasal drip, cough, irritability, and fatigue.</p><p>The pharmacologic management of allergic rhinitis is presented in this topic review. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic rhinitis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-allergic-rhinitis-rhinosinusitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis (rhinosinusitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25107333\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of allergic rhinitis involves the following components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergen avoidance, which is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergen-avoidance-in-the-treatment-of-asthma-and-allergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergen avoidance in the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacotherapy, which is discussed in detail in this review.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergen immunotherapy (when appropriate), which is reviewed elsewhere. Immunotherapy may be given as subcutaneous injections or (for a limited number of allergens) as sublingual tablets. Of note, subcutaneous immunotherapy helps prevent the development of asthma in children with allergic rhinitis and thus should be given special consideration in the pediatric population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic disease: Indications and efficacy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sublingual-immunotherapy-for-allergic-rhinoconjunctivitis-and-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Most patients with allergic rhinitis require pharmacotherapy, in addition to allergen avoidance, for satisfactory symptom control. As more medications become available without a prescription, patients can extensively self-treat, although the side effects of some over-the-counter allergy medications, particularly the excessive sedation and anticholinergic effects caused by older antihistamines, can be significant. Therefore, the challenge for clinicians is to assure that patients with moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis are adequately treated with medications that do not cause undue side effects.</p><p>Consensus guidelines have been published for the management of allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis/abstract/1-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-11</a>]. The recommendations in this topic review are consistent with these guidelines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104438136\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO SPECIFIC PATIENT GROUPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of allergic rhinitis in a specific patient is influenced by the frequency and severity of symptoms, the age of the patient, and the presence of concurrent conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>]. In this review, an approach to specific patient groups is presented initially, followed by a detailed discussion of available medications. (See <a href=\"#H25107340\" class=\"local\">'Available medications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104438408\"><span class=\"h2\">Young children (&lt;2 years of age)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of allergic rhinitis requires repeated exposure to inhaled allergens and is therefore uncommon in children under two years of age. If a child under two years appears to have persistent nasal symptoms, other disorders should be considered initially, such as adenoidal hypertrophy or chronic sinusitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-pediatric-physical-examination-heent#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The pediatric physical examination: HEENT&quot;, section on 'Adenoidal hypertrophy'</a>.)</p><p>If after an evaluation for other causes, a young child is determined to have allergic rhinitis, treatment options include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cromolyn</a> sodium nasal spray, one to two sprays three to four times daily, is attractive to some parents and clinicians because it has essentially no adverse effects. However, cromolyn is less effective than glucocorticoid nasal sprays and the dosing is inconvenient. Despite these limitations, it can be sufficient for controlling mild symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H25107445\" class=\"local\">'Cromolyn sodium'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second-generation antihistamines (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a>) are available in liquid formulations. Cetirizine and fexofenadine are approved for children &ge;6 months of age. (See <a href=\"#H25107403\" class=\"local\">'Second- and third-generation antihistamines'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>For children with severe symptoms not responsive to the above measures, a glucocorticoid nasal spray may be administered instead. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mometasone</a> furoate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> furoate, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children &ge;2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The dose for each of these agents in young children is one spray per nostril once daily. If necessary, two sprays each nostril can be tried for a limited period (we limit to two weeks and reassess symptoms) in view of the age-limited dose approval and the concern for potential systemic side effects (eg, adrenal suppression) in children at the higher dose.</p><p>We avoid first-generation antihistamines in young children because these agents can cause paradoxical agitation and may be dangerous in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The FDA has approved the use of azelastine in children &gt;5 years of age and the use of intranasal olopatadine in children &gt;12 years of age (its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated in younger children). (See <a href=\"#H25107431\" class=\"local\">'Antihistamine nasal sprays'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A glucocorticoid nasal spray (more effective than antihistamines), administered regularly or as needed.

(See <a href=\"#H25107445\" class=\"local\">'Cromolyn sodium'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>It should be explained to patients that each of these therapies is more effective when taken regularly, although as-needed use may be sufficient for very mild symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104438655\"><span class=\"h3\">Persistent or moderate-to-severe symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoid nasal sprays are the most effective single pharmacologic therapy for allergic rhinitis and are, in our opinion, the best initial therapy for patients with persistent or moderate-to-severe symptoms. All of the available preparations are equally effective, although the newer agents are more convenient and probably safer for long-term use than the older agents. The glucocorticoid nasal sprays with low bioavailability and once daily dosing, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mometasone</a> furoate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> furoate, are preferred for use in children.

Fluticasone propionate is approved for children &ge;4 years.

These agents downregulate inflammatory responses by binding to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm of inflammatory cells. The receptors undergo conformational changes upon activation, entering the cell nucleus where they bind with glucocorticoid response elements located on anti-inflammatory genes. These activated genes transcribe messenger RNA for anti-inflammatory proteins. At the same time, activated glucocorticoid receptors suppress the transcription of most cytokine and chemokine genes, whose products promote inflammation.

Sometimes patients can minimize these complications by using proper administration technique and by gradually reducing the dose once symptoms are controlled to the lowest effective dose for that individual. It is helpful to demonstrate proper use of all inhaled medications at the time of initial prescription and again at follow-up visits. Aqueous pump and dry powder sprays have different instructions for use.

Frank epistaxis is often hard to prevent, and once it occurs, may require future avoidance of glucocorticoid nasal sprays.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent or chronic epistaxis, even mild in degree, requires evaluation for chronic nasal inflammation, which can occur in a number of conditions. These include vasomotor rhinitis, chronic nasal staphylococcal infection, Beh&ccedil;et syndrome, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis), or chronic invasive fungal sinusitis. In our experience, episodic epistaxis also occurs in any dry nose syndrome, such as rhinitis associated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, sicca syndrome associated with Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, or atrophic rhinitis. The drying effects of cigarette smoking, caffeinated beverages, and medications with anticholinergic properties can also predispose to bleeding. Recurrent or chronic epistaxis should prompt rhinoscopy to determine the origin of the bleeding, even in patients thought to have epistaxis induced by installation of various medications, since malignancy of the nasal mucosa is also in the differential diagnosis.</p><p/><p>Nasal sprays should always be directed away from the septum. There are rare reports of nasal septal perforation with glucocorticoid nasal sprays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], although long-term studies of large numbers of patients have not found evidence of damage to the nasal mucosa despite years of use in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

In a large study of 474 prepubescent children ages 5 to 8.5 years at screening, subjects were randomized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> furoate or placebo for 52 weeks for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The dose of active agent was 110 mcg daily, which is the maximum recommended dose for this age group. A statistically significant reduction in growth velocity of -0.27 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> (95% CI, -0.48 to -0.06 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year)</span> was demonstrated. There was no detectable change in 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion to suggest adrenal suppression. Of note, the protocol used in this study did not allow for dose reduction once symptoms were controlled, which is the desired approach to therapy. Most previous studies, especially those with the second-generation agents, had shown no or limited HPA suppression at recommended doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis/abstract/54-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-62</a>]. Taken together, these studies indicate that a small decrement in growth velocity in children is possible with the use of some glucocorticoid nasal sprays, and this side effect needs to be considered in the context of specific glucocorticoids and doses used. Agents that are dosed once daily are preferred in this age group, since these are believed to, although not documented to, be less likely to impact the HPA and growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25107375\" class=\"local\">'Optimal use'</a> below.)</p><p>Longer-term studies of the effects on growth caused by inhaled glucocorticoids administered for asthma treatment (which deliver higher doses per actuation) are also reassuring. Despite these reassuring data, the adverse effects of glucocorticoid nasal sprays can be additive with those of other glucocorticoid preparations, such as inhaled agents for concomitant asthma or topical corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis, and therefore caution is needed. Growth in children should be monitored when any glucocorticoid-containing medication is prescribed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Growth deceleration'</a>.)</p><p>A small number of studies have examined the effects of glucocorticoid nasal sprays on bone mineral density and intraocular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. Some studies have demonstrated detrimental effects, although it is unclear whether these are large enough to result in clinically important outcomes over time, such as increased rates of fractures, glaucoma, or cataracts. A practice guideline on rhinitis concluded that studies in both children and adults have failed to demonstrate that these adverse effects are consistent or clinically relevant to use of glucocorticoid nasal sprays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Similarly, we do not recommend injections of long-acting glucocorticoids for this condition because of unpredictable absorption and the inability to dose adjust if side effects occur.

Second-generation agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levocetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levocetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desloratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desloratadine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a> have few of these problems and are preferred when antihistamine therapy is desired.
