Olfaction plays a significant role in our detection of the aroma and flavor of foods. It is also responsible for our awareness of fragrances in the environment. Disruption of the experience of a pleasant sensory exposure can sometimes cause depression. Patients may no longer look forward to eating and drinking, and they often refuse to go out to dinner and associate with friends. Important nutritional deficiencies can lead to marked weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Additional dangers associated with olfactory impairment include the inability to detect the odors of spoiled food, smoke, and leaking gas. Furthermore, the importance of olfaction cannot be overemphasized to certain professions such as chefs, perfumers, and fire fighters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some individuals with olfactory disorders find it difficult to function in everyday life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of patients with abnormalities of taste or smell requires a multidisciplinary approach which may include the primary care clinician, otolaryngologist, neurologist, allergist, and oral consultant. The approach to these patients is reviewed here. The anatomy of taste and olfaction and the causes of abnormalities in these areas are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and etiology of taste and smell disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of features in the patient's history can be useful in evaluating disorders of smell or taste (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56441 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68168 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] or viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] often produce <strong>sudden</strong> smell loss; in comparison, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, or neoplasms are associated with more <strong>gradual</strong> onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairment that is <strong>intermittent</strong> is often seen in allergic rhinitis and the use of topical drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms such as headache and behavior disturbances may indicate problems with the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition, occupational exposure (chemicals, toxic fumes) and tobacco and alcohol habits need to be explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Allergies and medications also may be causally related (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81856 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59575\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59575 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Subjective complaints of taste or smell loss need confirmation before embarking on an extensive evaluation. Many individuals confuse the ability to perceive &quot;taste&quot; and &quot;flavor.&quot; The former is related to the ability to detect sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. The term flavor involves the combined features of smell, taste, irritation, texture, and temperature. The smell or aroma of food and beverages is the most important contributor to flavor; as a result, derangement of smell is often described by patients as a problem with taste. Total loss of taste is rarely seen because of the anatomy and redundancy of the taste system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and etiology of taste and smell disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examination of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses by an otolaryngologist is essential since diseases in these areas can be responsible for a significant number of chemosensory disorders. In addition, a careful neurologic examination may reveal mental changes or peripheral nerve difficulties; olfactory complaints are occasionally the first symptoms to draw attention to a more serious neurologic problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The allergist plays an important role in the diagnosis of allergic and nonallergic rhinitis; evaluation of sensitivity to features in the home and work environment is essential. Skin testing may be necessary to confirm sensitivity to specific antigens.</p><p>Dental prostheses, periodontal disease, intraoral lesions, and the distribution of taste papillae are all important features of the physical examination. Many oral conditions such as fungal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and glossitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] are associated with taste dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of tests, including those assessing smell and taste and more general tests such as imaging and laboratory studies, are performed on the patient with abnormal smell or taste. Primary care clinicians do not often conduct smell or taste testing in their offices. An occasional clinician may do some superficial testing such as using chocolate, turpentine, coffee, or moth balls to test odor sensitivity. An efficient office test that could be used is the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The test involves 40 micro-encapsulated odorants that are released by rubbing with the tip of a pencil; identification of the odor is made from among four choices.</p><p>Another easy to use and reliable smell test has more recently been developed. The test involves use of the &quot;Sniffin sticks&quot; test (or TDIT-Threshold, Discrimination, Identification Test). One group reported that the technique only takes four minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The test was used effectively in an analysis of patients with Parkinsonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Sniffin sticks can be obtained through the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at the University of Dresden Medical School in Dresden, Germany.</p><p>Referral to a smell center, where more detailed testing can be easily and efficiently performed, is indicated when important defects are noted on any of these office-based tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemosensory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of quantitative psychophysical tests are used to evaluate chemosensation. These are threshold tests which determine the <strong>minimum</strong> concentration that can be detected. The ability to discriminate and identify taste and smells is also assessed. The patient is interviewed by a taste and smell technician at the beginning of olfactory testing. The details of the taste and smell complaints are noted, including the date of onset, the degree of impairment, and the circumstances at the onset of the difficulty. As an example, a history of viral infection preceding the problem would be of value in diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Butanol threshold test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The butanol threshold test evaluates olfactory function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This test uses N-butyl alcohol, a sweet smelling substance, as the odorant. The patient is presented with bottles containing either water or odorant in an aqueous concentration series ranging from 2 x 10(-7) to 4 percent. Each nostril is tested separately. The point of transition between detection and no detection is determined and the threshold concentration is converted into a numeric score. Appropriate tests are included to identify possible malingering, particularly in litigation cases.</p><p>An odor identification and trigeminal function test also are administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Eight different odorants are presented to each nostril and the patient is asked whether he or she is aware of a sensation from the odorant and if it can be specifically identified. Odorants that are irritating are used to assess trigeminal function in the nasal mucosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Whole mouth taste test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whole mouth taste testing assesses the patient's ability to detect, identify, and rate the intensity of various concentrations of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter taste solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The patient's data is compared to data obtained from &quot;normal&quot; control subjects and is assigned to a percentile <span class=\"nowrap\">score/rank</span> (number of subjects whose responses are below those of the patient) for each taste quality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Spatial test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spatial testing is performed since localized losses of taste often go unnoticed. Function in the different taste bud fields is assessed separately with regional testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. At our taste center, a cotton swab soaked in a specific taste solution is separately applied to four quadrants of the tongue and to each half of the soft palate. Taste function in the throat is assessed by asking the patient to swallow a portion of each taste solution. All of the regions mentioned are independently tested with each taste solution; in each case, the patient is asked to identify the taste quality and estimate its intensity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Flavor discrimination test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flavor discrimination test is used to evaluate the combination of both taste and smell sensation. Four different stimulant solutions are made available which differ in the amount of sweetener present. These are presented in a random order and the patient is asked to taste the various solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Somatosensory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of somatosensation in the mouth is carried out by the use of Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A patient's contact detection (pressure) threshold is determined by applying a Semmes-Weinstein monofilament which exerts a force when applied to a peripheral nerve field proportional to the gauge of the monofilament. Various areas in the interior of the mouth are tested.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to image depends on concerns raised from the history and physical examination. We image any patient with neurologic abnormalities on physical examination, who have a history of trauma, or where there is concern for sinus disease or neoplasm. We generally start with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the brain and soft tissues, including the sinuses. Computed tomography (CT) is an alternative that can be used to evaluate for sinus disease and is also useful for studying the skull base, cranial contents, sinuses, and nose. Plain radiography does not adequately evaluate the sinuses.</p><p>Imaging in patients with idiopathic olfactory loss is often unrevealing. In one retrospective cohort study of 839 patients with olfactory loss, MRI was used to evaluate idiopathic olfactory loss 55 percent of the time but only 0.8 percent of patients were found to have an imaging abnormality that explained their olfactory loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete blood count, sedimentation rate, plasma creatinine, liver function tests, antinuclear antibodies, and a thyroid profile are an essential part of the initial evaluation. Detection of antibodies to <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/SSA</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">LA/SSB</span> may be valuable in identifying patients with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, while measurement of lead, arsenic, and other heavy metal concentrations may be warranted in selected patients with dysgeusia. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vitamin B12</a> and other vitamin concentrations should be measured in patients with suspected malnutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of taste and smell disorders usually depends upon the etiology. Nasal and paranasal sinus diseases are the most common causes of olfactory abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasal and paranasal sinus disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstructive disorders such as allergic rhinitis, nonallergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis require relief of the obstruction and treatment of the accompanying infection, if present. Some patients with smell loss do not have significant obstruction on endoscopy or CT studies. It is possible that these cases are due to damage to olfactory receptors resulting from products of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]; improvement occurs with treatment of the nasal sinus disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H290129756\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic glucocorticoids reduce mucosal edema and polypoid elements, effectively treating the majority of nasal and paranasal sinus diseases. However, long-term use can cause a variety of adverse affects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.) Thus, these drugs are best employed in short courses of two to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Recurrent symptoms may occur after cessation of therapy, but often can be prevented by adding supportive long-term treatment such as intranasal glucocorticoids.</p><p>Intranasal glucocorticoids were first introduced for the treatment of rhinosinusitis in 1954 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, these early agents had the same adverse effects as systemic glucocorticoids. Topical glucocorticoids were subsequently introduced that could be administered over a long period of time and were rapidly metabolized to inactive or less active metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. They exhibited no significant side effects and proved to be satisfactory for the treatment of rhinitis, nasal edema, and polyps.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Beclomethasone</a> dipropionate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flunisolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flunisolide</a> have been used effectively in the United States at a dose of two sprays in each nostril twice daily. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mometasone</a> furoate monohydrate nasal spray is a newer agent that is administered at a dose of 50 &micro;g (two sprays in each nostril) once daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. All of the medications are highly effective in reducing the symptoms associated with perennial allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. One study suggested that mometasone furoate was superior to beclomethasone, but the results did not reach statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Long-term administration (twelve months) of mometasone furoate has not been associated with adverse tissue changes in the nasal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Inadequate drug dispersal can limit the efficacy of intranasal glucocorticoids. The spray should be administered in the head down and forward position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. After the initial spray, the patient should bend his head forward and down so that the medication is directed to the proper area, particularly since nasal obstruction and impaired ciliary movement can block access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Alternatively, an applicator that produces a squirt rather than a spray may be used to deliver the drug higher up in the nasal cavity, to reach the localized area of olfactory mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>A coexisting bacterial sinus infection is another factor that can limit the effectiveness of intranasal glucocorticoids. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ampicillin</a> (500 mg four times daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> axetil (500 mg twice daily) have been used successfully in our clinic when given in courses of at least two to three weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antihistamines may be indicated in cases of allergic rhinitis. Attention should also be given to factors in the home (eg, molds, pets) that might add to allergic problems. Desensitization is necessary in some cases. Leukotriene inhibitors can reduce the size of nasal polyps and improve smell in some patients with polyps and <span class=\"nowrap\">anosmia/hyposmia</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Treatment of chronic sinusitis and nasal polyposis, however, has variable effectiveness for improving anosmia.</p><p>In an open label, non-controlled, prospective study of 312 patients with hyposmia from a variety of causes (31 percent post-infectious, 31 percent allergic rhinitis, 14 percent post-head trauma), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> (200 to 800 mg) was found to improve subjective smell loss in 50 percent, with higher doses associated with improved smell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Improvement persisted as long as treatment was continued, which extended from 6 to 72 months. Further research, including placebo-controlled studies, is needed prior to wide-spread use for hyposmia.</p><p>Surgery may be necessary if medical therapy for nasal or sinus disease is ineffective. Polypectomy and sinus surgery are beneficial in many patients; endoscopic nasal and sinus surgery are significant advances in therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The surgical success rate is high for symptoms not involving smell and taste. In one study, for example, the surgical success rate (defined as the absence of purulent rhinorrhea, post nasal discharge, facial pain, and headache) was 88 percent in nonasthmatics; the recurrence rate for focal and diffuse polyps and infectious disease was 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effectiveness of endoscopic sinus surgery in treatment of smell disorders, however, is variably reported.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series, anosmia improved in 52 percent of patients with nasal polyposis treated with endoscopic sinus surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Greater disease severity, determined by the Kennedy sinus disease staging system, was associated with greater smell loss and persistent anosmia. Postoperative endoscopic examination revealed normal mucosa in 92 percent of patients whose sense of smell improved, compared with 17 percent of patients with persistent anosmia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, a multi-institutional prospective cohort study (n = 111) found that patients with severe olfactory dysfunction showed significant improvement in olfaction after endoscopic sinus surgery, while patients with milder impairments in olfaction did not significantly improve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The presence of nasal polyposis correlated with surgical success.</p><p/><p>Patients may need to continue medical management (nasal steroids, antihistamines, and leukotriene inhibitors) in the postoperative period to limit mucosal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Other disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Olfactory and taste impairment resulting from head trauma cannot specifically be treated. Rapid improvement may occur with resolution of edema and hemorrhage. &#160;Olfactory neurons do have regenerative capabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Regeneration can occur in cases of neural damage over a period of days or even years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>A longitudinal study of 542 patients presenting with olfactory loss of various etiologies to a university smell and taste center found that statistically significant change in function occurred in 57 percent of anosmic and 43 percent of microsmic patients over time (3 months to 24 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Complete recovery was seen in 11 and 23 percent of patients with anosmia and microsmia respectively. Recovery was related to patient age, severity of initial loss and duration of loss at first testing; etiology of olfactory loss, gender, and smoking did not predict recovery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Parosmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parosmia (abhorrent odor perception) associated with rhinosinusitis, head trauma, viral infection, or oral problems frequently disappears with successful treatment of the inciting conditions. Antiseizure medication is sometimes helpful in persistent cases. We have used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> in our clinic in several cases with some success.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysgeusia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of dysgeusia can be challenging. Improvement in the condition or conditions causing the dysgeusia often alleviates the problem. Where gastric reflux has been a significant etiologic factor, medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> have been very helpful. However, there are many instances where the complaint persists. We have successfully used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> in several such cases. Clonazepam causes brainstem serotonergic descending inhibition, binding more to central than peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of tests, including those assessing smell and taste and more general tests such as imaging and laboratory studies, are often performed by specialists on the patient with abnormal smell or taste. Primary care clinicians do not often conduct smell or taste testing in their offices. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of taste and smell disorders usually depends upon the etiology. Obstructive disorders such as allergic rhinitis, nonallergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyposis require relief of the obstruction and treatment of the accompanying infection, if present. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic glucocorticoids reduce mucosal edema and polypoid elements, effectively treating the majority of nasal and paranasal sinus diseases. However, long-term use can cause a variety of adverse affects. Intranasal glucocorticoids such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beclomethasone</a> dipropionate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flunisolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flunisolide</a> have been used effectively in patients with allergic rhinitis at a dose of two sprays in each nostril twice daily. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No effective treatment is available for olfactory and taste impairment caused by viral infections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> head trauma. However, olfactory neurons do have regenerative capabilities and some patients have partial recovery without treatment.
