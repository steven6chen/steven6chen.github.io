Although improvement has been noted in certain indicators, compared with other age groups, adolescent health has failed to respond to the range of interventions developed for schools, communities, and the health system.</p><p>Unintentional injuries such as automobile crashes, intentional injuries such as homicide and suicide, and reproductive health issues such as unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections remain the leading causes of adolescent morbidity and mortality. Alcohol and drug use contribute to many of these injuries and deaths. Obesity has become a major cause of adolescent morbidity and is a contributor to a dramatic increase in the number of youth with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Tobacco use causes harm during the teen years and can lead to nicotine addiction that results in major morbidity and mortality later in life. The common denominator in this list is that most adolescent morbidity and mortality is related to personal behavior and, as such, is preventable.</p><p>The preventable nature of all of these conditions provides a clear mandate to pediatric health care providers. The challenge is to integrate preventive services into routine medical care. Practitioners can use clinic visits for routine examinations, such as preparticipation athletic evaluations and chronic disease management, to provide a range of preventive services. These clinical encounters offer an opportunity for early identification of risk behavior and disease, updating immunizations, and offering health guidance. Clinical preventive services are an adjunct to preventive interventions provided through schools and in the community.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTIVE SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADOLESCENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of preventive services is to reduce serious morbidity and premature mortality both during adolescence and in later years. Preventive services typically fall into four categories: screening, counseling to reduce risk, providing immunizations, and giving general health guidance. In addition, a recommendation for how frequently routine visits should occur usually is included. Various organizations have developed or revised guidelines that are designed to enable practitioners to identify and address specific health problems and behaviors that cause the greatest burden of suffering among adolescents:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) &ndash; Guide to Clinical Preventive Services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>American Medical Association (AMA) &ndash; Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"http://www.aafp.org/patient-care/browse/all-recommendations-topic.html&amp;token=/1X6NxeTGe99QmZubox5SoVdqbYiRGbft4yk52AEKNjCatXLKY9d8eZZi/viuNbnAN1Pc4MreQEODBHyDxd5/R8nsaIauE0iejdCY0brf+s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=108\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal and Child Health Bureau, United States Public Health Services, and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.brightfutures.org/&amp;token=N7SjjQowCPqVcBtYJU+CuzpBwSgpEBlOYD+oK4VQxtLzPoEAc2qbo1qnBAVqtEnq&amp;TOPIC_ID=108\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Care Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bright <span class=\"nowrap\">Futures/AAP</span> &ndash; Recommendations for Pediatric Preventive Health Care 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) &ndash; Annual adolescent immunization schedules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58209\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58209 \">figure 1</a>); these recommendations include vaccines for preventing pertussis, human papillomavirus, influenza, and meningococcal disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meningococcal-vaccines\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meningococcal vaccines&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>The organizations use different methods to arrive at their guidelines. The USPSTF guidelines, for example, are based upon the proven ability of screening procedures and interventions to improve clinical outcomes.

When seeing adolescents for routine health evaluation, practitioners tend to focus on diseases or conditions with which they are familiar, rather than on health-risk behaviors and problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].</p><p>In addition to guidelines, therefore, practitioners need a strategy to help them integrate preventive services into routine medical care. The scheme presented in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58331\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef58331 \">algorithm 1</a>) can help providers screen for a large number of potential health risks, identify those that need further assessment, and focus on those that are of immediate concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Step 1: Gather information and identify problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of this step is to identify indicators for all or a subset of the specific health risks and problems listed above. Data that are easy to obtain and have a high sensitivity for the issues of greatest concern are collected. Height, weight, and blood pressure are measured; questionnaires to assess health risks, habits, and behaviors can be completed in the waiting area. The use of questionnaires can save time and improve identification of problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>The data that are gathered are used to guide the clinical interview and for further assessment. If no areas of concern are elicited, the practitioner can offer support and reinforcement for healthy behaviors. If, however, the indications are that the teen has a problem, such as being overweight or engaging in a health-risk behavior, then the practitioner goes to Step 2.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Step 2: Further assess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of this step is to determine, for each potential problem identified in Step 1, whether the teen is at high, moderate, or low risk for adverse consequences. The problems identified by the screening information are further assessed with a complete history and physical examination. If the problem presents an imminent and serious risk, then referral for specialty evaluation and management is appropriate. To illustrate the assignment of risk category, consider three 16-year-old girls who have a blood pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">85/60,</span> a pulse rate of 60, a weight of 85 pounds, and a weight for height ratio that is below the 55<sup>th</sup> percentile:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first girl discloses during the interview that she views her ideal weight as 70 pounds, is a gymnast who exercises vigorously on a daily basis, skips meals frequently, uses laxatives daily, and is amenorrheic. She has an eating disorder and is at high risk for metabolic collapse. Immediate referral for further medical and psychiatric evaluation is warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second girl reports a 10-pound weight loss over the past year, participates on the school gymnastic team, is a picky eater but does not skip meals, and is amenorrheic. She maintains a diet to control her weight because it helps her perform her routines. The physical examination is normal. This girl is at moderate risk for an eating disorder and should have her weight and metabolic status monitored closely during follow-up visits. If the clinical situation is different at the time of follow-up, the risk category can be amended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third girl has always been thin, views her body weight as appropriate, exercises only during physical education classes at school, and is having regular menses. This girl is at low risk for an eating disorder and can be provided with information on healthy diet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Step 3: Identify and prioritize problems together</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the practitioner has determined the risk category for each of the problems, he or she should have a discussion with the adolescent to acknowledge the problems and prioritize the problem list. The existence of a therapeutic relationship between the practitioner and the adolescent will facilitate this discussion. Adolescents tend to respond to an approach that enlists their cooperation and involvement in the decision-making process. The practitioner can foster a therapeutic alliance by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assuring the adolescent the information shared with the practitioner will remain confidential, unless the information indicates that they are at risk for harming other or themselves (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Listening to and valuing the adolescent's perspective</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not responding to information regarding personal behaviors in a derogatory or punitive manner</p><p/><p>The practitioner and the adolescent must come to an agreement regarding the type and severity of each problem. Although the practitioner might believe that smoking, monthly use of alcohol, and skipping breakfast are the top issues of concern, the adolescent may rank these behaviors in a different order or may not even view them as problems. Without the teenager's acceptance of the problem list and its prioritization, chances of compliance with the management plan are nil. Unless the behavior is life-threatening in the immediate future, the practitioner and the adolescent must negotiate what they will work on together. The negotiation process provides the occasion to determine whether the adolescent is ready to change his or her behavior and to identify opportunities for and barriers to change. This information is necessary to proceed to the development of a management plan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Step 4: Solutions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Developing a management plan for the set of problems involves five steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negotiate the intervention &ndash; Discuss management options with the teen and determine, together, the best course of action. If the adolescent views the ultimate outcome to be too difficult, then negotiating more immediate, attainable objectives is reasonable. As an example, losing 2 pounds per month for six months may be more acceptable to a teen than losing 12 pounds as the long-term goal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Promote the teen's confidence that the management plan can work &ndash; Motivation to work on a behavioral change plan is key to success.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss strategies with the teen to overcome barriers to the management plan &ndash; Have the teenager identify a list of the barriers that he or she believes will interfere with the strategy for changing the behavior. Help plan ways to overcome the barriers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Develop a contract or verbal agreement with the teen regarding joint expectations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow up with the actions identified &ndash; The patient can make contact through electronic mail, telephone calls to office staff, and postcards prior to future office visits.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">INTEGRATING PREVENTIVE SERVICES INTO ROUTINE MEDICAL CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most health systems for pediatric care have well-established procedures for health maintenance visits, they are less likely to be set up to provide comprehensive preventive services for adolescents. Establishing systematic changes facilitates the ability of practitioners to deliver preventive services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. National programs and materials can be modified to meet local needs and directions, as the local clinic must take ownership of the preventive services that are delivered. Objectives should be clear and protocols well delineated before broad changes are instituted. The integration process requires time and the complicity of each staff member. Experience with the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS) program and information from the clinical literature on services for adult patients provide a set of steps for successful integration of comprehensive adolescent preventive services into routine medical care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68463\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68463 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of the GAPS recommendations to improve preventive health care service to adolescents was analyzed before and after implementation of the GAPS program in five community and migrant health centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The percentage of adolescents who reported having received preventive screening or counseling increased after implementation in 19 of 31 content areas including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical or sexual abuse (22 versus 10 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual orientation (27 versus 13 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fighting (21 versus 6 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weapons (22 versus 5 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression (34 versus 16 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suicide (22 versus 7 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating disorders (29 versus 11 percent)</p><p/><p>In an additional study, researchers found that with appropriate skill-based training, clinicians can successfully implement preventive services in routine outpatient visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guidelines-for-adolescent-preventive-services/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Thus, following an educational intervention, the proportion of adolescents screened by their primary care providers for seat belt use, helmet use, tobacco use, alcohol use, and sexual behavior increased from 38 to 56 percent, 27 to 45 percent, 64 to 76 percent, 59 to 76 percent, and 61 to 75 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most adolescent morbidity and mortality is related to personal behavior and, as such, is preventable. Clinicians have an important role in early identification of risk (screening), counseling to reduce risk and provide general health guidance (anticipatory guidance), and provision of immunizations.
