Twenty were identified through the Spontaneous Reporting System of the Food and Drug Administration, and the other four patients had been treated by the authors.

The median absolute decrease in the hematocrit due to the AIHA was 14 percent (range: 8 to 29 percent). Four patients died as a result of the initial episode of AIHA.

Rather, patients with a DAT which is positive at the time of diagnosis or which becomes positive over the course of therapy should be watched with particular vigilance for any evidence of hemolysis.
