With the advent of new medicines, the vast majority of patients with HCV infection who have access to them can be cured with treatment. Newer treatments are of shorter duration, have fewer side effects, and have higher cure rates. The goal of treatment of chronic HCV infection is a sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as absence of virus in the blood 12 weeks after the cessation of treatment. Patients achieving an SVR are considered cured, as studies show that 99 percent of patients who achieve a SVR remain free of detectable virus during long term follow up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review patient selection for antiviral therapy in the context of the availability of all oral HCV regimens, as well as peginterferon and ribavirin-based regimens.

The discussion in this topic is largely consistent with these guidelines. </p><p>Other guidelines include treatment recommendations from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. World Health Organization (WHO) also released guidelines in 2014 on screening and treatment of HCV, intended primarily for clinicians and policy-makers in low- and middle-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Links to these and other guidelines can be found below.

Treatment is safe and effective, and can mitigate the serious consequences of this disease, and thus all patients, with the exception of those with life expectancy limited to &lt;12 months due to non-related conditions, should be considered for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H586271595\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety and virologic efficacy of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In locations where combination direct-acting antiviral regimens are available, these highly effective, well-tolerated, interferon-free regimens can result in sustained virologic response (SVR) in over 90 percent of HCV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, achieving a cure of HCV, which results in improved survival, reduced morbidity, and higher quality of life in the vast majority of patients, has become more likely and much easier with the availability of newer agents. For this reason, all patients should be considered for treatment. (See <a href=\"#H620696534\" class=\"local\">'Deciding when to treat'</a> below.)</p><p>The selection of specific treatment regimens is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotype-1-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-2-and-3-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 2 and 3 infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-genotypes-4-5-and-6-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 4, 5, and 6 infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H514880734\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction in liver-related morbidity and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main risk of HCV infection is progression to cirrhosis and its attendant complications. Curing HCV prior to the development of decompensated cirrhosis results in decreased all-cause mortality, liver-related death, need for liver transplantation, hepatocellular carcinoma rates, and liver-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/6-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-21</a>]. </p><p>After acute infection with HCV, about 55 to 80 percent of patients remain chronically viremic; ie, they develop chronic infection. In a systematic review of 111 studies analyzing the natural history of chronic HCV the estimated prevalence of cirrhosis 20 years after infection was 16 percent (95% CI 14 to 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This wide variation in fibrosis progression rates probably reflects host factors, study design, referral bias, and geographic differences. Even though we have identified many factors associated with rate of fibrosis progression, it is very difficult to predict the rate of fibrosis progression in an individual patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Natural history'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Factors associated with disease progression'</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, many patients acquire HCV as young adults and often live with infection for 30 or more years, and the likelihood of developing cirrhosis continues to increase as the patient ages. As a result of such long standing infection in large numbers of patients, the burden of HCV has grown. As an example, in the United States, HCV is a major cause of cirrhosis, end stage liver disease, and liver cancer, and complications of chronic HCV are the most common indication for liver transplantation, accounting for more than 40 percent of transplants in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. After an orthotopic liver transplant, 95 percent of patients develop recurrent HCV infection of the new graft, which is the leading cause of graft failure in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Achieving SVR through successful antiviral treatment can dramatically reduce HCV-related morbidity for the individual, even when advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis) has already developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/9,18,20,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18,20,27</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 26 observational studies that assessed long-term outcomes of HCV-infected patients with advanced fibrosis after treatment, those who did not attain an SVR had a liver-related mortality rate of 2.7 percent per year. In contrast, those who did achieve an SVR had a much lower risk of liver-related mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.19; 95% CI 0.10-0.37) and were significantly less likely to develop HCC (RR 0.32) or hepatic decompensation (RR 0.13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similarly, in a prospective study of patients with advanced fibrosis who underwent antiviral treatment and were followed for a median of 79 to 86 months, morbidity and mortality rates were lower among the 140 patients who achieved SVR (2 and 3 percent, respectively) compared with the 209 patients who had no response to therapy (21 and 27 percent morbidity and mortality, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H514880740\"><span class=\"h2\">Improvement or prevention of extrahepatic complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even patients with chronic HCV who have no evidence for advanced fibrosis (bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis) are still at significant risk for developing extrahepatic manifestations of HCV, some of which can be life threatening. A cure of HCV prevents the development of extrahepatic manifestations. </p><p>In a prospective, multicenter study of 321 patients with chronic HCV, 122 of them (38 percent) had at least one extrahepatic manifestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Extrahepatic manifestations that are associated with, and in most cases caused by, HCV include essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, B cell lymphoma, renal disease, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, neuropathy, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and porphyria cutanea tarda. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extrahepatic-manifestations-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HCV is also associated with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. In a meta-analysis of 34 observational studies, HCV-infected patients had a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes mellitus than control populations (hazard ratios 1.67 [95% CI 1.28-2.06] among prospective studies and odds ratio 1.68 [95% CI 1.15-2.20] among retrospective studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Achievement of SVR results in a lower incidence of diabetes and decreased insulin resistance among HCV infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].

A variety of methods are available to identify genotypes. The commonly used method of genotyping is the line probe assay (INNO-LiPA HCV II, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics), which provides genotype and subtype. Currently, only genotype (not subtype) is used in making clinical decisions regarding treatment.

Fibrosis stage can be assessed indirectly through history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and other noninvasive studies (such as the FibroSure and ultrasound-based transient elastography). Although some practitioners still utilize liver biopsy for assessment of fibrosis stage, we do not routinely biopsy patients with HCV. (See <a href=\"#H690483381\" class=\"local\">'Role of liver biopsy'</a> below.) </p><p>The history should include questions regarding nonspecific symptoms (eg, anorexia, weight loss, weakness) or complications that could suggest underlying cirrhosis (eg, a history of jaundice, ascites, hematemesis, and mental status changes). A directed physical examination should assess for signs consistent with cirrhosis (eg, spider angiomata, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, firm liver on palpation, and splenomegaly). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Important laboratory testing includes a complete blood count, serum aminotransferase activity and measures of synthetic function (bilirubin, prothrombin time, and albumin). Common laboratory abnormalities in cirrhosis include elevated serum bilirubin, abnormal aminotransferases, elevated alkaline phosphatase, a prolonged prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/elevated</span> international normalized ratio (INR), low albumin, and thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Laboratory findings'</a>.) </p><p>Various noninvasive markers of liver fibrosis can be very helpful to assess to the degree of liver fibrosis present. Some of these, such as the <span class=\"nowrap\">AST/ALT</span> ratio, the AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-aspartate-aminotransferase-ast-to-platelet-ratio-index-apri\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), and the FIB-4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cirrhosis-probability-in-hepatitis-c-fib-4-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>), can be calculated from results of routine laboratory tests. Other specialized noninvasive diagnostic tests include the FibroSure and ultrasound-based transient elastography. Potential benefits of these noninvasive markers are ease of administration and lower cost compared with liver biopsy. Also, they can be repeated over time to monitor progress of liver disease and may predict clinical outcomes better than liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

As an example, patients with advanced fibrosis should undergo routine screening for hepatocellular carcinoma, and patients with established cirrhosis should be monitored for the development of complications. This includes evaluating for clinical signs of liver failure (including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or bleeding from gastroesophageal varices) as well as laboratory testing to identify hepatic dysfunction (hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, or hypoprothrombinemia).

Thus, all patients with virologic evidence of chronic HCV infection (ie, detectable HCV viral level over a six month period), except for those with limited life expectancy (&lt;12 months) due to non-related conditions, should be considered for treatment. Candidacy for treatment is limited mainly by the presence of contraindications to the available regimens. (See <a href=\"#H620696332\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications/precautions with anti-HCV agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Before the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), antiviral treatment of HCV infection with peginterferon and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> was variably effective for different patient populations, was associated with numerous contraindications and adverse effects, and in some cases required prolonged duration of therapy. In order to optimize administration of a difficult treatment regimen, management decisions focused on identifying patients who would be most likely to respond to therapy or who were most likely to suffer liver-related morbidity and mortality without successful treatment. With the increasing availability of DAAs, treatment regimens that achieve very high SVR rates, have more favorable adverse effect profiles and greater ease of administration than earlier regimens, and have relatively short treatment durations are possible for many patients. Thus, curative, all-oral regimens are possible for the vast majority of patients who have access to these agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-acting-antivirals-for-the-treatment-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct-acting antivirals for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nevertheless, if financial resources preclude more widespread delivery of antiviral therapy, it can be prioritized for those who would be most likely to benefit in the near-term, as recommended by the joint guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The highest priority patients include those who are at highest risk of substantial morbidity and mortality from untreated HCV infection, namely those with advanced fibrosis or compensated fibrosis, transplant recipients, and those with severe extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection. High priority patients include those at high risk of fibrosis progression, such as patients with substantial fibrosis (eg, Metavir stage F2), HIV coinfection, coexisting liver disease, and diabetes mellitus. Symptomatic HCV infection (eg, with debilitating fatigue or other less severe extrahepatic manifestations) and the potential for transmission of HCV are additional considerations that might prioritize treatment in a given patient. </p><p>If interferon-free regimens are not yet available for the patient, but are expected to be in the near future, we favor deferring therapy until that time, unless there is a compelling reason to initiate treatment earlier. Such reasons may include the presence of advanced fibrosis, severe extrahepatic complications, or patient preference. (See <a href=\"#H9641794\" class=\"local\">'Bridging fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H790096192\" class=\"local\">'Extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who do defer antiviral treatment to wait for future regimens, liver wellness (eg, alcohol abstinence, maintaining a healthy weight, control of diabetes mellitus) and close monitoring of clinical status are warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620696332\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS/PRECAUTIONS WITH ANTI-HCV AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct-acting antivirals are well tolerated by the vast majority of patients, although some comorbidities preclude certain regimens.

If financial resources are constrained, it is reasonable to prioritize treatment for those who have a higher risk of fibrosis progression (eg, those with Metavir stage F2 fibrosis, HIV coinfection, coexisting liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and debilitating fatigue), significant symptoms associated with HCV infection, and high potential for transmission of HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>However, if interferon-free regimens are not yet available for the patient, but are expected to be in the near future, we favor deferring therapy until that time, as these newer treatments have higher SVR rates and fewer adverse effects.

On one hand, there is a risk that such patients may have progression of liver disease, potentially to decompensation, while awaiting the availability of newer therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. On the other hand, patients with cirrhosis have a substantial risk of adverse effects with interferon, and there appear to be some patients with apparently compensated cirrhosis who are at risk of decompensation when treated with an interferon-based regimen, although the risk factors for decompensation among these patients are not clear. In a study that included 455 patients with HCV genotype 1 and compensated cirrhosis who were treated with peginterferon, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telaprevir-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telaprevir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=boceprevir-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">boceprevir</a>, serious adverse events occurred in 38 to 49 percent of patients, with 4 percent of patients developing hepatic decompensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-selection-for-antiviral-therapy-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

In addition, the use of growth factors (such as erythropoietin and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) may be helpful during treatment by limiting the need for excessive reductions in the dose of certain antiviral agents.
