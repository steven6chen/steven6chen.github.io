At that time, EGC was defined as a neoplasm that could be successfully treated with surgery. EGC is now defined more specifically as an adenocarcinoma that is restricted to the mucosa or submucosa, irrespective of lymph node metastasis (T1, any N) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 1</a>). These cancers have a significantly better prognosis (approximately 90 percent five-year survival rate) than do more advanced stages of gastric cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, this definition, which has been adopted by the Japanese National Cancer Centre, the Japan Gastric Cancer Association, and other international groups, acknowledges that there are a small percentage of patients with EGC who have lymph node involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These cancers should still be considered EGC, even if they have nodal metastases, as is supported by decades of investigation and data from screening programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>However, nodal metastases can affect treatment in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have proven nodal metastases, patients whose pretreatment local staging evaluation indicates a high likelihood of nodal metastases, and patients with T1 disease who are at high risk for nodal metastases (because of tumor size, configuration, or depth of invasion) may not be appropriate candidates for endoscopic resection. Gastrectomy with removal of the regional nodes is the appropriate treatment strategy for such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis#H757935970\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early gastric cancer: Treatment, natural history, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Endoscopic therapies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with node-positive resected EGC are candidates for adjuvant therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=early-gastric-cancer-treatment-natural-history-and-prognosis#H757936033\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Early gastric cancer: Treatment, natural history, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant therapies'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric cancer demonstrates marked geographic variability, both regionally and within countries. High-incidence areas include Latin America, Eastern Asia, and areas in Europe and the Middle East [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the United States, the overall incidence rates are modest, and remain greater than those of esophageal cancer. When compared with Caucasians, the incidence is higher in all non-Caucasian ethnic and racial groups including Hispanics, Asian, and African-Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For unclear reasons, a rising incidence of gastric cancer has been recently observed among young adults in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The incidence of early gastric cancer (EGC), as well as the proportion of gastric adenocarcinomas that are EGCs, vary depending on the population:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Japan and Eastern Asia, up to one-half of resections for gastric adenocarcinoma represent EGC. In Japan, the proportion rose from 15 to as high as 57 percent with the introduction of screening programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Korea, 25 to 30 percent of gastric adenocarcinomas are EGCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States and Europe, EGCs account for 15 to 21 percent of gastric adenocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/14,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17-19</a>]. </p><p/><p>There are several proposed explanations for the higher incidence of EGC in Asian versus Western countries. The 5- to 10-fold higher incidence rates of gastric cancer in Eastern Asia contribute to this phenomenon. In addition, screening programs have been in place in Japan for several decades, and more recently in other parts of Eastern Asia, facilitating early detection. Lastly, there is a well-described difference in the interpretation of gastric histology in Eastern versus non-Asian centers. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Histologic classification'</a> below.)</p><p>Gastric cancer screening in Japan began in the 1960s, and continues as gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality in that country. Photofluorography had been the dominant method recommended for screening in Japanese national guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Photofluorography is a double-contrast radiographic examination in which patients swallow effervescent granules and then drink 200 to 300 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a>. Several plain radiographs are obtained of the stomach from different positions. Patients with abnormalities detected are then referred for additional evaluation. </p><p>There has been a transition to magnification chromoendoscopy with indigo-carmine spray in experienced centers in eastern Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, there is variation in screening practices by country and region. Methods used to screen for gastric cancer include endoscopy, radiology, <em>H. pylori</em> serology, and serum pepsinogen testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Of note, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> is currently in limited supply in many areas due to a shortage of the raw materials used in its production.

The disagreement centers on the characterization of high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Western pathologists have typically required invasion of the lamina propria for the diagnosis of cancer, whereas Japanese pathologists have based the diagnosis on cytologic and architectural changes alone, without requiring invasion of the lamina propria. As a result, lesions classified as high-grade dysplasia by Western pathologists may be classified as intramucosal carcinoma by Japanese pathologists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer#H646035135\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Asian versus Western nomenclature'</a>.)</p><p>The extent of the discrepancy is illustrated by one study, in which four Japanese and four Western pathologists examined 17 gastric biopsies and 18 endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) specimens from 17 Japanese patients, with findings ranging from reactive atypia to early gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Detection of small or subtle lesions can be difficult and may be missed even by experienced endoscopists. Careful inspection of the entire gastric mucosa with biopsy of any suspicious lesion is essential. The Japanese experience underscores the practice of meticulous upper endoscopy: the patient is prepared with a defoaming agent combined with a mucolytic agent to improve visibility; there is a careful, systematic inspection of the stomach with adequate air insufflation; and there is extensive photodocumentation (&gt;25 images) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-gastric-cancer-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].
