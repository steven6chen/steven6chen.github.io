A limitation of studies that have been published is that their data were collected a decade or more ago, when the potency (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] concentration) of cannabis used in the United States was about one-third that of currently available cannabis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Comparison across the studies below suggests that intensity (amount multiplied by duration) of cannabis use is positively correlated with prevalence of cannabis withdrawal, similar to the well-established relationship for other psychoactive substances such as alcohol and opiates. In general, individuals using cannabis daily or almost daily have a greater than 50 percent prevalence of withdrawal, while those using cannabis less than weekly experience little or no withdrawal. The prevalence of withdrawal among individuals with intermediate intensities of cannabis use is not well established and may depend on the presence or absence of other factors.

Four large surveys of non-treatment-seeking adult twins or family members recruited for genetic studies also found a low prevalence of cannabis withdrawal (3 to 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. </p><p>Treatment-seeking cannabis users have a higher prevalence of withdrawal than non-treatment-seeking cannabis users, as might be expected from their usually greater intensity of cannabis use and the likelihood that the discomfort of withdrawal itself promotes treatment-seeking. As an example, among 450 United States and 229 Australian adults enrolled in outpatient clinical trials of psychosocial treatment for cannabis use disorder, almost all of whom were daily smokers of cannabis multiple times per day, the prevalence of cannabis withdrawal was 77.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and 95.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], respectively. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1527910816\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary risk factors for cannabis withdrawal are intensity and recency of cannabis use.

There were also associations between amount of cannabis used on the last occasion and physical symptoms (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.7-10.5) and psychological symptoms (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.8-11.7). Cannabis withdrawal was assessed every one to two days with the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F114025\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114025 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Other potential risk factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetics &ndash; </strong>Genetics appear to play a substantial role in susceptibility to cannabis withdrawal. A study of 2276 adult Australian twins with lifetime cannabis use, of whom 11.9 percent met DSM-5 criteria for cannabis withdrawal, found that 55 percent (95% CI 0.1-81) of the between-individual variation in withdrawal was attributable to additive genetic variations, 12 percent (95% CI 0-57) to shared environmental factors, and 33 percent (95% CI 19-51) to nonshared environmental factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Cessation of cannabis use results in a loss of (exogenous) agonist activation, leaving CB1 receptors in a hypoactive state that presumably mediates withdrawal symptoms. Over time, the receptors return to their normal pre-cannabis exposure state (up-regulation).</p><p>Positron emission tomography studies using radioligands highly selective for the CB1 receptor find that adult, non-treatment-seeking, chronic daily or almost daily cannabis smokers have 10 to 15 percent CB1 receptor down-regulation (ie, reduced receptor density or reduced receptor binding potential) in many brain regions, especially the cingulate and temporal cortex, during the first 24 hours after last cannabis use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>]. This down-regulation is normalized after four weeks of monitored abstinence. However, the interval temporal course of receptor normalization and its association with cannabis withdrawal remain unclear. One study found complete receptor normalization after two days of abstinence and a negative correlation between degree of normalization and intensity of cannabis withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Three or more of the following signs and symptoms develop within approximately one week after cessation of heavy, prolonged use:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>1. Irritability, anger or aggression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>2. Nervousness or anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>3. Sleep difficulty (ie, insomnia, disturbing dreams).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>4. Decreased appetite or weight loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>5. Restlessness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>6. Depressed mood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>7. At least one of the following physical symptoms causing significant discomfort: abdominal pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">shakiness/tremors,</span> sweating, fever, chills, or headache.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C. The signs or symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D. The signs or symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder, including intoxication or withdrawal from another substance. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1182557660\"><span class=\"h2\">Withdrawal severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cannabis withdrawal and its treatment are typically categorized in terms of its severity, ie, mild, moderate or severe withdrawal; however, DSM-5 does not define these categories by the number of withdrawal symptoms present (as they do in criteria for substance use disorders). Withdrawal severity is typically established based on clinical judgment.</p><p>We think of <strong>mild</strong> cannabis withdrawal, in general, as consisting of symptoms that <strong>minimally</strong> interfere with the patient&rsquo;s functioning and do not contribute to a high risk of relapse, while <strong>moderate</strong> and <strong>severe</strong> syndromes constitute the middle and high end of this spectrum. In our experience, patients with mild cannabis withdrawal, absent comorbid psychiatric illness, do not typically present clinically for treatment of withdrawal. Among patients presenting for treatment, common problems include impaired interpersonal functioning (eg, relationship problems), mood disturbance (eg, anxiety, depression), and disrupted sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1186868393\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cannabis withdrawal symptoms are largely nonspecific, so they must be carefully distinguished from other withdrawal syndromes, especially tobacco [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], and from other psychiatric disorders (eg, generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder) that may produce similar symptoms. Among adolescent girls, the triad of poor appetite, weight loss, and gastrointestinal symptoms associated with cannabis withdrawal may be misdiagnosed as an eating disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In all cases, the major distinguishing feature is the temporal association with abrupt cessation of chronic or heavy cannabis use and the gradual resolution of symptoms with increasing duration of abstinence.</p><p>Tobacco withdrawal may be particularly difficult to distinguish from cannabis withdrawal, as the symptoms highly overlap, and many cannabis users also use tobacco [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Small, open-label retrospective and prospective outpatient studies in adult, non-treatment-seeking daily cannabis and daily tobacco smokers find that the two withdrawal syndromes have comparable symptom profiles, intensities, and time courses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/40,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,43</a>]. These findings are confirmed by an open-label, outpatient within-subjects study of 12 adult, non-treatment-seeking chronic daily or almost-daily users of cannabis and tobacco [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. There was no difference in withdrawal severity between the two substances; concurrent withdrawal from both was more severe than from either alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3765550615\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-cannabis-use-disorder-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Cannabis use disorder and withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258335248\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannabis withdrawal is manifested by a constellation of signs and symptoms occurring within one week after abrupt reduction or cessation of heavy and prolonged cannabis use, including irritability, anger, anxiety, depression, and disturbed sleep. Physical symptoms, eg, abdominal discomfort, headache, muscle tremors, or twitching, are relatively uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H1092123156\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals using cannabis daily or almost daily have a greater than 50 percent prevalence of withdrawal, while those using cannabis less than weekly experience little or no withdrawal. Less is known about the prevalence of withdrawal among individuals with intermediate intensities of use. (See <a href=\"#H606088943\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disturbed sleep is one of the most common symptoms of cannabis withdrawal. Most polysomnography studies during the first week of cannabis withdrawal find increased sleep onset latency; decreased total sleep time, slow wave sleep, sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement (REM) latency; and increased REM time. (See <a href=\"#H1236747011\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cannabis withdrawal symptoms appear 24 to 72 hours after cessation of use, reach peak intensity over the first week, and largely resolve after one to two weeks. There appears to be substantial inter-individual variation. Sleep disturbances may last several weeks. (See <a href=\"#H63385018\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otherwise unexplained mood changes, restlessness, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite or weight loss, or physical symptoms such as abdominal pain or muscle twitching, aches, or tremors in an individual who was recently a heavy cannabis user should arouse suspicion of possible cannabis withdrawal. (See <a href=\"#H3534522382\" class=\"local\">'Assessment and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, World Drug Report 2016, Vienna 2016.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cannabis-withdrawal-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Swift W, Wong A, Li KM, et al.
