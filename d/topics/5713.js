Ductoscopy has been used more widely in breast surgery in Asia with the advent of durable submillimeter endoscopes and duct distention techniques. However, ductoscopy is not commonly performed in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/8-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-16</a>].</p><p>In this topic, we discuss the use of ductoscopy to diagnose and treat conditions such as pathologic nipple discharge and early-stage breast cancer. Other aspects of nipple discharge are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nipple-discharge\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nipple discharge&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of pathologic nipple discharge&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764883\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ductoscopy provides a way to directly visualize and sample or excise lesions in the mammary ducts. The indications for performing a ductoscopy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic nipple discharge from a single duct orifice (bloody or high-volume clear fluid)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Known breast lesions (atypical ductal hyperplasia [ADH], ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS], or invasive cancer) with expressible nipple fluid</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764890\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic nipple discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is the most common indication for mammary ductoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/4,9,13,14,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,13,14,17-19</a>]. Pathologic nipple discharge is characterized by bloody or high-volume clear fluid discharge from a single duct. Most series that did not employ ductoscopy found malignancy in 7 to 9 percent of patients with pathologic nipple discharge. Thus, it is essential to properly evaluate women with pathologic nipple discharge for filling defects and abnormalities of the ductal lining using tools such as galactography or ductoscopy, even in the absence of any abnormal imaging findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-pathologic-nipple-discharge#H10390871\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of pathologic nipple discharge&quot;, section on 'Normal ultrasound and mammogram'</a>.)</p><p>Ductoscopy may be performed in women with pathologic nipple discharge, especially in high-risk women who make abundant nipple fluid with a suspicious fluid cytology. When ductoscopy is performed, the detection rate for breast cancer may be as high as 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. The higher detection rate may be explained by the capability of ductoscopy to detect malignant lesions that are deep and peripheral in the breast, lesions that are not always detectable on traditional breast imaging. These malignant lesions may have been missed by only blindly removing the proximal duct behind the areola where papillomatous lesions are located.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764897\"><span class=\"h2\">Early-stage breast cancer with expressible nipple fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many (over 85 percent) patients with stage 0, I, or II breast cancers (especially if the invasive component is &lt;2.5 cm) have expressible nipple fluid from a duct connected to the tumor, especially when examined closely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. Sometimes the fluid cytology is malignant or severely atypical. Even when nipple fluid does not contain cytologically detectable cancer cells, fragments of cancer cell DNA could be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Ductoscopy was first used to investigate the cause of malignant or severely atypical cytologies from ductal lavage or nipple aspiration fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. Its use has been expanded to identify cancerous lesions and any associated proliferative diseases in the same duct tree in patients with early breast cancer. When performed at the time of breast lumpectomy, ductoscopy is a reliable way of both documenting the presence or absence of extensive intraductal carcinoma (EIC) and directing complete resection at first attempt at lumpectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>In a retrospective series of 201 women with breast cancer, DCIS, or ADH, ductoscopy was technically successful in 75 percent of patients, among whom half were found to have additional lesions outside of the planned lumpectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For the 83 patients who were found to have additional lesions, ductoscopy altered the extent of surgical resection, reducing the reexcision rate dramatically in this series.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764904\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10472610\"><span class=\"h2\">Prior nipple surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior nipple surgery or breast reduction surgery that divided ducts behind the nipple would preclude ductoscopy for lack of access.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10472616\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiduct or nonreproducible discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ductoscopy is not performed in patients with either discharge from multiple ducts or fluid discharge that is nonreproducible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764919\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2537617\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After clinical evaluation, women presenting with pathologic nipple discharge should undergo a focused ultrasound. In addition, a mammogram should be performed within six months for women &ge;30 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Although ductoscopy can locate minute intraductal lesions not detectable by other means, it cannot possibly visualize the entire ductal epithelium. In other words, ductoscopy is specific but not sensitive. Thus, ductoscopy should be used in conjunction with other breast imaging modalities to ensure that no lesion is missed in breast evaluation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2537630\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative hydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important that patients are well hydrated at home prior to arriving for ductoscopy (to maximally distend mammary ducts) so that the correct duct orifice can be properly identified in the cold operating room. Cold temperatures in the operating room can cause nipple papillary muscle spasm, which prevents expression of fluid from the ducts. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764926\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomical cross-sectional studies reveal 18 to 25 ducts behind the nipple, but lactational studies show only 8 to 12 ductal orifices that produce milk. Thus, many of the ducts are truncated without developing into formal lactiferous ducts with branching glands. These truncated ducts usually terminate around the areolar edge and are associated with periareolar abscess formation. The remaining larger ducts branch widely and into differing quadrants. </p><p>The ducts arising from the outer third of the nipple papilla branch widely and cover large areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88526\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88526 \">picture 1</a>). The more centrally located ducts have a branching pattern shaped like a tear drop located directly behind the nipple. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764933\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10472435\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial steps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial steps of a ductoscopy are common to all patients undergoing the procedure. The patient is positioned supine. After dekeratinizing the nipple by using a facial exfoliant to rid the papilla of keratin plugs, the breast is massaged in a centripetal fashion using hand lotion until fluid can be expressed through an orifice. The hand lotion allows for gentle, firm compression without bruising or irritating the skin of the breast. </p><p>Once fluid is successfully expressed through an orifice, that orifice is cannulated with a 2-0 Prolene suture cut to a gentle taper. If the duct is too small to cannulate with a 2-0 Prolene suture, more rigid introducers, such as the smallest lacrimal duct dilator, can be used. After initial cannulation, the duct is progressively dilated in the Seldinger fashion using a 24 gauge intravenous catheter (eg, Angiocath). Following that, the duct is injected with 1 to 5 mL of a local anesthetic agent through the intravenous catheter for distension and analgesia. Gradual dilation of the duct is more pertinent to patients with breast cancer, as their ducts tend to be small and less distensible. A Crawford lacrimal duct stent has two soft metal dilators at each end, which can be used as alternative to the Prolene suture. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764962\"><span class=\"h2\">Subsequent steps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once a mammary duct is cannulated and properly dilated, a scope sheath is inserted, through which a submillimeter ductoscope at least 6 cm in length (eg, the Acueity 0.9-mm microendoscope) can be introduced to perform a ductoscopic examination according to specific indications for different patient subgroups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764970\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathologic nipple discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who present with pathologic nipple discharge, the suspicious or target duct can be easily and reproducibly identified. These ducts are often quite large and therefore easy to cannulate. Once a duct is anesthetized and dilated by the instillation of local anesthetic, ductoscopy is readily performed. </p><p>The scope sheath is first introduced into the duct using the Seldinger technique. The hollow introducer is then removed from the sheath and replaced by the ductoscope. It is important to have the scope focused and white-balanced before insertion. The surgeon keeps the duct distended by saline or local anesthetic injection via the scope sheath while minimizing back-flow by compressing the nipple papilla against the scope between the thumb and index finger. </p><p>The scope is advanced as distension is maintained. Outward distraction of the nipple and gentle back-and-forth motion of the underlying breast mound negotiate the scope tip into varying branches. At each junction, the ductoscope is always navigated into the largest branch possible, as the branch with the largest diameter usually leads to the most proliferative lesion. </p><p>When an intraductal lesion is identified, it is either surgically excised or biopsied through a separate skin incision. If an excision is performed, the operating room lights are turned off to transilluminate the lesion within the breast using the tip of the ductoscope. In patients who have a single lesion (most commonly papilloma) found on ductoscopy, a minimal surgical excision aided by transillumination is sufficient.</p><p>If biopsy is planned, the tip of the scope is identified with ultrasound so that percutaneous biopsy of lesions located near the scope tip can be carried out. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2538151\"><span class=\"h4\">Multiple lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple intraluminal lesions are associated with a much higher rate of clinically occult cancer and should be widely excised if concentrated in a relatively small region of the ductal system. When lesions are found remote from the nipple areolar complex, a wider surgical resection is needed to assure identification of any malignant and premalignant diseases. </p><p>In a retrospective study of 27 patients who underwent ductoscopy for pathologic nipple discharge, 19 patients had multiple lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One-third of the patients had both papillomas and either usual or atypical ductal hyperplasia. Cancer was identified in two patients, both of whom had a more proximal papilloma in the same ductal system. In one patient, cancer was found at 7.5 cm deep to the nipple. These results suggest that the classic blind resection of ducts in the retroareolar space may underestimate the true extent of diseases accounting for pathologic nipple discharge. </p><p>The surgeon should not assume that a lesion seen on mammogram or ultrasound fully accounts for the nipple fluid. In our experience, over one-half of cancers found at ductoscopy have a proximal papilloma right behind the nipple.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764977\"><span class=\"h3\">Early-stage breast cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with breast cancer who have expressible nipple fluid, ductoscopy can often identify associated proliferative diseases in the same ductal tree as the known cancer, as long as the duct is connected to the nipple.</p><p>In these patients, however, the nipple fluid may be a very small volume and is often difficult to produce to allow correct identification of the ductal orifice. Thus, adequate preoperative breast massage is more important in these patients. Most breasts with cancer will only have one to three orifices that produce fluid and the clock position of the known cancer can often hint at which duct is likely to be connected to the cancer. Peritumoral Lymphazurin injection for sentinel lymph node biopsy or local anesthetic injection prior to lumpectomy, if performed before breast massage, can also help identify the correct ductal orifice by staining the duct blue and by contributing to the volume of fluid expressible through the ductal system. In general, the ductal orifice chosen should lie within 100 to 110 degrees radially from the nipple papilla of the known lesion position in the breast. </p><p>In breast cancer patients, the ducts producing fluid are not as enlarged and easy to cannulate as they are in patients with other causes of nipple discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/8,10,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,30,31</a>]. Thus, ductal cannulation may be substantially more challenging. Special care must be taken to prevent perforation of the lactiferous sinus during dilation of the papillary nipple sphincter. If the retroareolar portion of the duct were perforated, the duct would no longer distend properly and ductoscopy would be limited or impossible. Ductal distention needs to be gentle and is expected to take longer. When a duct perforation is seen or suspected from soft tissue infiltration in the retroareolar space, instillation of any fluid should be stopped. Gentle circular motion of the scope may allow the crescent-like collapsed distal duct to be cannulated with the scope. Once the distal duct is engaged for a distance of 10 to 15 mm, regular ductoscopy with saline distension can be resumed.</p><p>With proper ductal distension, ductoscopy can be conducted. It is important to direct the scope into the largest possible branch at each junction, as larger branches are more likely to be associated with significant lesions. This strategy minimizes the time spent to reach the target lesion (ie, obstructing tumor), which is then marked with transillumination to be included in the planned resection (lumpectomy). Smaller side branches can be investigated as the scope is gradually withdrawn, marking each additional site of intraluminal defect with transillumination as well.</p><p>Finally, the scope is left at the most proximal (nipple-ward) of intraluminal disease; alternatively, that location is identified by transillumination or palpation and marked with a suture. A pie-wedge shaped excision is then designed to include all of the breast tissue from the most peripheral to the most proximally marked lesions. This approach ensures that all lesions identified by ductoscopy are included in the resection. The width of this wedge is determined by the locations of the intraluminal disease foci identified in the side branches. Most breast resections should be carried out using oncoplastic techniques, which are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oncoplastic-techniques-in-breast-conserving-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oncoplastic techniques in breast-conserving surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8013099\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative (Asian) technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Asian centers, where ductoscopy was first introduced into clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], ductoscopy is performed with an alternative technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/3,32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32-36</a>]. The Asian technique of breast endoscopy uses a rigid optical fiber, which carries both light and image, and used air insufflation to distend the ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/1,4,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,36</a>]. Air distension can lead to the formation of bubbles within a fluid-secreting duct, which can appear as image-distorting reflective balls. Any lesions identified by the scope also tend to be compressed against the sidewall of the duct from air distension. Once a bleeding source is recognized, it is resected or biopsied through the skin with transillumination. Further refinements of this technique have allowed cyst puncture with a 22 gauge or larger needle, followed by ductoscopy directly through the puncture tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/6,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10472240\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We know from several studies that solitary lesions found on ductoscopy are more likely to be benign, and the probability of finding a cancer increases with multiple lesions. However, the visual appearance alone on ductoscopy is not adequate to reliably distinguish between malignant and benign lesions without tissue biopsy.</p><p>Brush biopsies can be taken through a ductoscope and preserved in a carrier fluid such as Cytolyte. Most biopsies taken by small ductoscopes are not sufficient for traditional histology, and are therefore classified as &quot;chunky cytology&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/39-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-45</a>]. This can limit the diagnostic accuracy of these biopsies. Although ductoscopy is a powerful tool, it must be used in combination with other imaging modalities until we have reliable molecular diagnostics for biopsies taken through these submillimeter scopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ductoscopy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Until further technical advances are made, any biopsy result that suggests significant proliferation (eg, atypical ductal hyperplasia) must be followed up with a core needle biopsy or surgical excision, in order to avoid under-sampling the lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764991\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a ductoscopy procedure, it is normal for bloody fluid to drain from the nipple for several (one to five) days. Women are encouraged to place a feminine napkin within their bra to catch any nipple fluid that may drain, which avoids putting tape on sensitive breast skin. Other routine postoperative care is provided to patients who undergo a surgical excision of breast tissue concomitantly with ductoscopy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25764998\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common complication associated with ductoscopy is ductal perforation. Perforation usually rapidly deflates the distended duct and prevents continuation of the ductoscopy procedure. The infiltration of saline or local anesthetic into the periductal space does not cause any major consequences. Once the duct is healed, repeat endoscopic examination can be performed in as early as 7 to 14 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25765012\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mammary ductoscopy is an endoscopic technique that allows for direct visualization and sampling of intraductal lesions.
