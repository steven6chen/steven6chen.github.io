This method represents the gold standard in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It is, however, not performed routinely in clinical practice. Instead, urine samples are generally obtained after natural micturition; in this setting, some degree of artifactual contamination with normal urethral organisms must be accepted.</p><p>This topic discusses the collection and analysis of voided urine for the diagnosis of UTIs in adults.

In theory, this would be a clean-catch, midstream sample of the first micturition of the day. In fact, there is no clinical evidence that this ideal specimen yields more accurate results. Collection of a midstream urine, with or without cleaning of the urethral meatus, at the time of clinical evaluation likely produces a reasonable specimen for analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The likelihood of detecting a bladder bacteriuria by voided urine culture is highest if urine is collected on arising. This sample is likely to be most concentrated and bacteria in the bladder will have had time to multiply overnight. However, this ideal sample is not practical since most cultures are obtained at the time the patient is seeing the clinician. With samples collected later in the day, the combination of a more dilute urine and partial bacterial washout due to multiple voids may lower the colony count below the accepted definition for bacteriuria diagnostic of a UTI. (See <a href=\"#H3018608\" class=\"local\">'Definition of a positive culture'</a> below.) </p><p>An optimal clean-catch, midstream urine is collected through the following steps in attempts to minimize the degree of contamination with bacteria from the urethra:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local disinfection of the meatus and adjacent mucosa should be performed with a non-foaming antiseptic solution, such as Dakin&rsquo;s solution (diluted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-hypochlorite-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium hypochlorite solution</a> 0.5%); this region should then be dried with a sterile swab to avoid mixture of the antiseptic with urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact of the urinary stream with the mucosa should be minimized by spreading the labia in females and by pulling back the foreskin in uncircumcised males.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial stream of the voided specimen should be discarded since the initial urine flushes urethral contaminants. It is the subsequent midstream sample that should be sent to the laboratory.</p><p/><p>However, clinical studies do not demonstrate that cleaning the meatus is associated with lower rates of contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Thus, for patients in whom the cleaning step may be impractical or difficult, a midstream urine collected (with the labia spread, for women) is likely an appropriate sample.</p><p>For men with suspected chronic bacterial prostatitis, evaluation of the last few drops of urine after prostatic massage is indicated. Firm prostatic massage per rectum, from lateral to midline on each side, causes the contents of the prostatic ducts to be expressed; vertical strokes in the midline will then project the secretions into the urethra and permit counting of leukocytes. Of note, this maneuver should be avoided when acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected because of the risk of bacteremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis#H14689268\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Obtaining and testing prostatic specimens'</a>.)</p><p>Urine sampling techniques in young children are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine collection techniques in infants and children with suspected urinary tract infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3018988\"><span class=\"h1\">URINE HANDLING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urine sample should be sent immediately to the bacteriology laboratory since bacteria will continue to proliferate in the warm medium of freshly voided urine, leading to increased bacterial counts (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-specimen-collection-and-transport\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology specimen collection and transport&quot;</a>). If such immediate referral is not possible, the container should be transported in iced water and then stored in a refrigerator at 4&ordm;C. Cooling stops bacterial growth, but the following day the bacteria can still grow on culture medium. However, urinary leukocytes may be altered by refrigeration, possibly affecting interpretation of the urinalysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3019156\"><span class=\"h1\">DIPSTICKS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H713085668\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dipsticks to evaluate for urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of UTI. Dipsticks are generally performed whenever UTI is suspected. However, we do not routinely collect urine for dipstick in young nonpregnant women with a history clearly suggestive of a UTI (ie, typical symptoms without vaginal discharge or irritation), as the dipstick generally does not provide additional useful information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p>A positive dipstick can support the diagnosis of UTI in a patient with suggestive symptoms, and a negative test can refute the diagnosis if clinical suspicion is low. However, a negative nitrite and leukocyte esterase on the dipstick may represent false negative results in a truly infected patient, and a urine culture should generally be performed if clinical suspicion is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Specific details of dipstick performance are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H713085675\" class=\"local\">'Accuracy'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, dipsticks to evaluate for leukocyte esterase and nitrite should not be performed in patients without any symptoms consistent with a UTI, as a positive dipstick, which would denote the presence of pyuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacteriuria, does not indicate a UTI in an asymptomatic patient. The rationale for this is similar to the reasons not to screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-asymptomatic-bacteriuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with asymptomatic bacteriuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H713085675\"><span class=\"h2\">Accuracy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dipsticks detect the presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrite in the urine. Leukocyte esterase corresponds to pyuria and nitrite reflects the presence of Enterobacteriaceae, which convert urinary nitrate to nitrite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Leukocyte esterase may be used to detect &gt;10 leukocytes per high power field (sensitivity of 75 to 96 percent; specificity of 94 to 98 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A positive nitrite test is a reliable index of significant bacteriuria, although a negative test does not exclude bacteriuria. </p><p>The dipstick nitrite test depends on the presence of nitrate (from dietary metabolites) in the urine that is then converted to nitrite by bacteria also present in the urine; normally no detectable nitrite is present. When bacteriuria is significant, the test is positive in about 80 percent of cases in which the urine has incubated for at least four hours in the bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Reasons for a negative nitrite test despite the presence of bladder bacteriuria include insufficient bladder incubation time for conversion of nitrate to nitrite, low urinary excretion of nitrate, inability of some organisms to convert nitrate to nitrite (such as <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em>), and decreased urine pH (due to cranberry juice or other dietary supplements). False positive nitrite tests can occur with substances that turn the urine red, such as the bladder analgesic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenazopyridine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenazopyridine</a> or the ingestion of beets. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Red to brown urine'</a>.) </p><p>Most studies have supported the diagnostic value of the nitrite and leukocyte esterase results, particularly when they are concordant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. A meta-analysis including 70 publications concluded that the urine dipstick test alone is useful when both nitrite and leukocyte esterase tests are positive (sensitivity 68 to 88 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic value of dipstick testing has been evaluated in both primary care and emergency settings. In a review of six studies that included women aged 17 to 70 with suspected UTI in primary care settings, positive dipstick findings (nitrite or leukocyte esterase and blood) had sensitivity and specificity of 75 and 66 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a systematic review of four studies that evaluated the utility of dipstick results in addition to history and physical examination findings in diagnosing uncomplicated UTI in women presenting to the emergency room, a negative dipstick urinalysis accurately ruled out the diagnosis of UTI (as confirmed by urine culture) when the pretest probability was low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Across the studies, which included 948 women, the prevalence of UTI ranged from 40 to 60 percent and only a positive nitrite reaction was useful to rule in a UTI and only a negative leukocyte esterase or blood reaction were accurate in ruling out a UTI.</p><p>However, other studies have suggested that dipstick results are of lower clinical utility. In one study, 434 adult females with suspected lower UTI in a primary care setting were assessed; sixty-six patients had confirmed UTI. The presence of nitrite, leukocyte esterase, and blood on the dipstick as well as clinical criteria (urine cloudiness, dysuria, and nocturia) were evaluated for diagnostic value. The negative predictive value was 67 percent for the absence of all features, and the positive value was 82 percent for the presence of three features. The authors concluded that dipstick results can modestly improve diagnosis, but cannot adequately rule out infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Similarly, in a study of 2252 women with overactive bladder, dipstick test was not sufficient to identify patients with UTI (sensitivity and specificity 44 and 86 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROSCOPY FOR PYURIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72782293\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation of pyuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In truly infected patients, a significant number of leukocytes <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;10/microL</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">10,000/mL)</span> should generally be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Given the very high association between infection and pyuria, an absence of pyuria on microscopic assessment can suggest colonization instead of infection when there is bacteriuria (although bacteriuria and pyuria does not necessarily signify infection, particularly if there are no symptoms). Hemocytometry is the preferred method of microscopic assessment for pyuria, but the less accurate method of counting leukocytes in the sediment of centrifuged urine is more commonly employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In a study of women with symptoms of UTI, a urine leukocyte count &ge;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> as measured by hemocytometry, was found in 61 of 62 women who had evidence of bladder bacteriuria through culture of suprapubic aspiration or urethral catheterization samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, only 7 of 34 asymptomatic women had &ge;8 urine <span class=\"nowrap\">leukocytes/microL,</span> of whom three were found to have asymptomatic <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em> infection of the cervix. In a separate study of women with urinary symptoms and low count bacteriuria (&gt;10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> colony forming <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL),</span> pyuria defined as &ge;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">leukocytes/microL</span> was associated with isolation of urinary pathogens (<em>E. coli</em> and <em>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</em>) in contrast to other organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>The threshold of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> on hemocytometry corresponds to 2 to 5 leukocytes per high power field in the sediment of centrifuged urine. However, assessment of pyuria by the latter method is subject to some technical pitfalls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Two important variables are contamination with vaginal secretions in women and the volume of supernatant in which the centrifuged pellet is resuspended, which will affect the leukocyte count. </p><p>White blood cell casts in the urine are indicative of kidney inflammation, which may reflect pyelonephritis or other renal conditions. </p><p>The presence of bacteria in the absence of pyuria, especially when various strains are found, is usually due to contamination during sampling. When the patient is asymptomatic, finding various bacterial strains should not be considered a UTI.</p><p>However, in a symptomatic patient who has complaints consistent with cystitis and bacteriuria, but does not have pyuria, a repeat urine sampling should be done. If the pattern is the same, with bacteriuria but no pyuria and with persistent symptoms of urethral inflammation, this is consistent with the &quot;acute urethral syndrome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and antibiotic treatment should generally not be undertaken at that<strong> </strong>point. However, this is a vague clinical entity that could potentially be an equivalent of bacteriuria at low counts.

In early studies, &gt;95 percent of patients with bacterial counts &ge;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> in voided urine, but only a minority of those with lower counts had concomitant bacteriuria on a catheterized specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Subsequent studies have identified a substantial number of women with symptoms and pyuria consistent with a UTI but colony counts &lt;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> in voided urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/1,23,24,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23,24,36-39</a>]. This was demonstrated in a study of 202 premenopausal, nonpregnant women who presented with at least two symptoms of acute cystitis, collected a midstream, clean-catch urine, and subsequently underwent urethral catheterization to collect a bladder urine specimen. Of the 121 women who had <em>E. coli</em> grow in a catheterized specimen, 49 (40 percent) had counts of &lt;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> in their voided urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A threshold of &ge;10<sup>2</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> in voided specimens had a 93 percent positive predictive value for bladder bacteriuria with <em>E. coli</em>. Another study estimated that 88 percent of women with symptoms and a CFU count &ge;10<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/mL</span> on voided urine have a UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>It is not well understood why some infected women have low colony counts. One possibility is that low counts reflect insufficient sensitivity of conventional urine cultures. In a study that included 220 women with symptoms of acute cystitis and 86 asymptomatic women, urine was tested with both standard culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for <em>E. coli,</em> <em>S. saprophyticus</em>, and sexually transmitted pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Among symptomatic women, 81 percent of urine cultures were positive for any uropathogen while 95 percent of samples were qPCR positive for <em>E. coli</em> (19 were positive for <em>S. saprophyticus</em> qPCR, 1 for <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>, and 1 for <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>). In contrast, urine culture and qPCR were positive for <em>E. coli</em> in only 11 and 12 percent, respectively. These findings suggest that almost all women with typical urinary complaints and a negative culture still have an infection with <em>E. coli</em>.</p><p>Management of these patients is similar to those with higher colony counts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are also several other settings in which a colony count of &le;10<sup>5</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/mL</span> often represents true infection rather than contamination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients already being treated with antimicrobials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among men, in whom contamination is a much lesser problem.

The growth of bacteria and leukocytes in urine collected in this manner from a patient with typical symptoms is the gold standard for diagnosis of a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, suprapubic aspiration cannot be considered in clinical practice and urine collected after natural micturition is the more practical and appropriate specimen collected. Evaluation of such a specimen must take into account some degree of artifactual contamination. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In theory, the ideal voided urine specimen for evaluation of a UTI is a clean-catch, midstream sample of the first micturition of the day, but there is no clear clinical evidence that such a specimen yields more accurate results. Collection of a midstream urine, with or without cleaning of the urethral meatus, at the time of clinical evaluation likely produces a reasonable specimen for analysis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Urine sampling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dipsticks, which detect the presence of leukocyte esterase and nitrite in the urine, can be used as a screening tool and are generally performed whenever UTI is suspected. However, in young nonpregnant women with a history clearly suggestive of a UTI, they may not provide additional useful information. A positive nitrite test is a reliable index of significant bacteriuria, although a negative test does not exclude bacteriuria. A negative nitrite and leukocyte esterase on the dipstick in a patient with symptoms of UTI may represent false negative results. (See <a href=\"#H3019156\" class=\"local\">'Dipsticks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In truly infected patients, a significant number of leukocytes <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;10/microL)</span> should generally be present. Given the very high association between infection and pyuria, microscopic assessment for pyuria can be helpful in distinguishing between colonization and infection when there is bacteriuria and compatible symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Microscopy for pyuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whereas true infection without pyuria is unusual, pyuria can occur in the absence of apparent bacterial infection, particularly in patients who have already taken antimicrobials. Other causes of sterile pyuria include contamination from vaginal secretions and other causes of uroepithelial inflammation. When the more common causes of sterile pyuria have been eliminated, patients with dysuria and frequency should be evaluated for atypical organisms, such as <em>Chlamydia</em>, <em>Ureaplasma urealyticum</em>, or tuberculosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Sterile pyuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of pretreatment urine culture in the evaluation of suspected UTI is to confirm the presence of bacteriuria and to identify and provide antibiotic susceptibility information on the causative organism (often retrospectively, if treatment is empirically given). Culture of a clean-catch voided urine specimen is warranted for these purposes among most patients with suspected UTI, except for healthy non-pregnant young women with typical symptoms of uncomplicated UTI, in whom symptoms are generally diagnostic and empiric treatment is usually successful. (See <a href=\"#H3018602\" class=\"local\">'Indications for urine culture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Indications for pretreatment urine culture in young, nonpregnant women include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suspicion of a complicated infection </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atypical symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presentation suggestive of pyelonephritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Failure to respond to initial therapy, raising the possibility of a resistant organism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurrent symptoms less than one month after treatment of a previous UTI for which no culture was performed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In asymptomatic patients, the standard threshold for bacterial growth on a midstream voided urine that is reflective of bladder bacteriuria as opposed to contamination is &ge;10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">(CFU)/mL</span>. However, in symptomatic women with pyuria, lower midstream urine counts (ie, &ge;10<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/mL)</span> have been associated with the presence of bladder bacteriuria and thus may still be indicative of a UTI. Lower bacterial counts still representative of infection are also seen in men, in patients already on antimicrobials, and with organisms other than <em>E. coli</em> and <em>Proteus</em> species.
