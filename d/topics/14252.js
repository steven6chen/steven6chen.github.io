Patients with CLL have underlying abnormalities in immune function related to the primary disease process in addition to defects in immune function related to the specific antileukemic therapies administered. The spectrum of infections in CLL patients has expanded with the use of therapies such as the purine analogs and monoclonal antibodies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>).</p><p>The approach to infection prevention will be reviewed here.

Most recommendations for antimicrobial prophylaxis have been extrapolated from prophylactic regimens used in treatment trials as well as from anecdotal reports. Since the immune defects caused by specific CLL therapies have significant impact on subsequent infectious complications, our prophylaxis recommendations vary depending upon the type of therapy used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F95493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95493 \">table 1</a>). Additional considerations that impact antimicrobial prophylaxis in individual patients are treatment status (treatment na&iuml;ve versus heavily pretreated) and past history of infections. There are no unique prophylaxis recommendations for older adults versus younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Suggested prophylactic regimens (for those with an indication) are summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F95619\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95619 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has developed supportive care guidelines for CLL patients based upon expert consensus opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

We suggest testing hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) prior to initiation of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy. If one or both of these tests is positive, a quantitative hepatitis B viral load should be checked using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Patients who are receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be HBcAb positive due to passive transfer. In HBsAg-positive patients who are planning to receive anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy, we give prophylactic antiviral therapy with activity against hepatitis B (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-infections-in-patients-with-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>].
