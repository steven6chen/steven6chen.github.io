Overweight or obese patients with binge eating disorder have varying goals. (See <a href=\"#H130122394\" class=\"local\">'Treating obesity in patients with binge eating disorder'</a> below.)</p><p>It is not clear if binge eating causes negative medical consequences in normal weight patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Thus, standard, first-line treatment consists of psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal therapy. Medication is also efficacious as a second-line treatment. However, head-to-head trials comparing different active treatments are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, it is not known whether there are different subtypes of the disorder that respond preferentially to each treatment option.</p><p>Although binge eating disorder tends to follow a long-term remitting and relapsing course, nearly all treatment studies have been short term. Some of these studies have collected follow-up data one to two years after the end of treatment, but there is limited information describing the status of patients more than two years after treatment ended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130122345\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for binge eating disorder nearly always takes place on an outpatient basis. Inpatient, partial hospital, or long-term residential treatment is considered only if the patient has additional psychopathology or medical morbidity that requires a more intense level of care, (eg, suicidality) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3060059\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment team</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with binge eating disorder receive individual psychotherapy, although group therapy is also commonly provided. Pharmacotherapy may be provided by a clinician with prescribing privileges. Thus, the treatment team typically consists of a therapist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychiatrist or primary care clinician, particularly if medications are being prescribed. Nutritionists (registered dieticians) may also be involved in providing behavioral weight loss therapy or nutritional counseling. Primary care clinicians who typically do not treat binge eating disorder may refer the patient.

A meta-analysis examined six randomized psychotherapy trials (five with cognitive-behavioral therapy, one with dialectical behavior therapy, total of 301 patients) and found a large clinical effect for psychotherapy in reducing binge eating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. By contrast, the same study performed a separate meta-analysis of randomized pharmacotherapy trials, and found a medium-sized clinical effect. None of the underlying trials involved a head-to-head comparison of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. &#160;</p><p>Psychotherapies that have demonstrated efficacy for treating binge eating disorder include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy, and dialectical behavior therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. There are fewer data supporting the use of psychodynamic psychotherapy, but the consensus of clinical experts is that it may help reduce binge eating in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>The psychotherapy of choice for binge eating disorder is either CBT or interpersonal therapy, based upon the results of randomized trials that have evaluated each treatment, either separately or within the same study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/8,13,15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,15-21</a>]. We suggest CBT because there is more evidence supporting its use. In addition, CBT has been adapted for use in different formats. </p><p>Persistent improvement in binge eating disorder often occurs following treatment with CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, or behavioral weight loss therapy; however, many patients tend to follow a long term remitting and relapsing course of illness: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an observational study of 55 patients initially treated with CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy in a randomized trial, assessments were completed post-treatment, one year after treatment cessation, and four years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Substantial improvement during treatment was followed by worse outcomes during follow-up; nevertheless, at the six year follow-up, only 8 percent met diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder.</p><p/><p>A longer duration of psychotherapy leads to better outcomes. In a pooled analysis of 11 randomized trials (1073 patients with binge eating disorder), the probability of remission was greater with longer treatments (odds ratio 2.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3058077\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive-behavior therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with binge eating disorder, we suggest CBT as first line treatment. CBT has been more widely studied for binge eating disorder than any other treatment, and multiple reviews and treatment guidelines concur that CBT is the primary treatment for binge eating disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/8,9,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,11,14</a>]. CBT is suitable for most patients, and there are no specific contraindications.</p><p>CBT is usually administered by a clinician (therapist-led) to either an individual patient or a group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Alternatively, patients with binge eating disorder can receive CBT through a self-help program, which requires either limited or no involvement of a clinician (guided or pure self-help). The use and administration of CBT to treat binge eating disorder is discussed separately, including the theoretical foundation of CBT, the format for providing the treatment, self-help forms of CBT, and the specific interventions that comprise CBT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=binge-eating-disorder-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Binge eating disorder: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Randomized trials indicate that CBT can be efficacious for binge eating disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/8,9,11,14,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,11,14,25</a>]. As an example, a pooled analysis of four randomized trials (n = 295 patients) compared therapist-led CBT with a waiting list control condition (no treatment), and found that abstinence from binge eating episodes occurred in more patients who received CBT than controls (59 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, CBT appears to be well tolerated, based upon excellent rates of treatment completion (approximately 80 percent), and remission with CBT is maintained at one- and two-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/9,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,26</a>]. However, waiting lists do not control for nonspecific aspects of psychotherapy (eg, attention), and a review found that reduction of comorbid depressive symptoms was comparable for CBT and waitlists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. &#160;</p><p>For patients with binge eating disorder who are treated with CBT, a good prognostic sign is a prompt and clinically-meaningful change in symptoms. In a 16 week randomized trial, rapid response was defined as a 65 percent reduction in binge eating by the fourth week of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Among patients who received CBT (n = 54), remission occurred in more patients with a rapid response than patients without a rapid response (73 versus 43 percent).</p><p>Among patients with binge eating disorder who are treated with CBT, a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa is associated with poorer outcomes. At the end of a 20 week randomized trial that compared three types of group CBT for treatment of binge eating disorder (n = 189), the mean number of binge episodes in the past month was greater in patients with a lifetime history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa than patients with no such history (seven versus two episodes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, the difference persisted at the one year follow-up assessment. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122508709\"><span class=\"h3\">Self-help CBT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many studies have demonstrated that self-help based upon CBT is efficacious for treating binge eating disorder. In addition, self-help may be as effective as specialty treatments such as therapist-led CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy. However, self-help CBT may be less effective when delivered in a primary care setting, rather than a specialty setting such as an eating disorder clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Various methods are available for administering self-help CBT to patients with binge eating disorder.

The review also found that patients may respond better to guided self-help that specifically addresses binge eating disorder, as opposed to nonspecific self-help focusing upon obesity or self-assertion.

According to the theoretical foundation of interpersonal psychotherapy, binge eating is caused by an unresolved interpersonal problem in at least one of four possible areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grief, ie, the death or disappearance of an important person, recently or in the past, which was not adequately resolved </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interpersonal role dispute, ie, conflicts with a significant other (spouse, partner, family member, close friend, or coworker) over different expectations about the relationship </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Role transition, ie, difficulty with a major change in the patient&rsquo;s life circumstances, including relationships (marriage or divorce), occupation (eg, graduation, leaving a job, or retirement), living conditions (eg, moving), financial situation (eg, change in socioeconomic status), and physical health</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interpersonal deficit, ie, pervasive problems starting and maintaining relationships, social isolation, and chronically unfulfilling relationships </p><p/><p>The therapeutic strategy in interpersonal psychotherapy is to initially identify the interpersonal problem area or areas that are most closely linked to binge eating and related behaviors. The clinician then focuses upon experimentation and constructive change in the relevant interpersonal problem areas, with little ongoing reference to the binge eating problem per se. Interpersonal psychotherapy does not focus on weight loss and does not produce significant weight loss in most individuals, but it appears that the subsequent weight course in individuals who stop binge eating is more normal compared with the weight course seen in individuals who continue to binge eat. </p><p>Interpersonal psychotherapy has primarily been studied in a group format. In two randomized trials, interpersonal psychotherapy led to significant reductions in binge eating and associated psychopathology that was comparable to CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].

Thus, most patients may prefer psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy). However, pharmacotherapy may require less time or be less expensive. It is therefore reasonable to use pharmacotherapy as first-line treatment for patients who prefer medication and decline psychotherapy, as well as patients who do not have access to psychotherapy.

A limitation of the available data on medications for binge eating disorder is that most trials lasted 12 weeks or less, and thus little is known regarding longer term effects on binge eating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/13,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,57</a>].</p><p>Evidence supporting the use of pharmacotherapy includes randomized trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pooled analysis of 13 trials (n = 1254 patients) found that remission from binge eating occurred in more patients who received pharmacotherapy (eg, antidepressants or antiepileptics) than placebo (49 versus 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Improvement of depression was also greater with antidepressants.</p><p/><p>The benefit of pharmacotherapy for binge eating disorder symptoms appears to be less than the effect of psychotherapy or self-help.

However, it is difficult to compare the efficacy of different active treatments because none of the underlying trials involved a head-to-head comparison of pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy or self-help therapy. In addition, the comparators for pharmacotherapy were placebo, whereas the comparators for psychotherapy were waiting lists (no treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7221395\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with binge eating disorder, we suggest clinicians use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) because of efficacy and tolerability.

Two trials (total n = 468) found that abstinence from binge eating episodes occurred in more patients treated with topiramate than placebo (approximately 60 versus 30 percent), and a pooled analysis of three trials (n = 967) found that abstinence occurred in more patients treated with lisdexamfetamine than placebo (40 versus 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Most studies have found that weight loss interventions, including low and very low calorie diets, are similarly effective in obese patients who binge eat compared to obese patients who do not binge eat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-overview-of-treatment/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Patients in these studies lost about 3 to 5 kg, which represented 5 to 10 percent of initial body weight. Unfortunately, long-term maintenance of weight loss is rare.

These episodes are accompanied by a sense of disinhibition and lack of control over eating. Binge eating episodes occur, on average, at least one day per week for three months. (See <a href=\"#H130122329\" class=\"local\">'Definition of binge eating disorder'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H262929238\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of the patient with binge eating disorder should include the patient&rsquo;s psychiatric status (attitude toward body weight and shape, comorbid psychiatric disorders), medical status (focusing on overweight- and obesity-related comorbidities when appropriate), and nutritional status (lifetime weight and dieting history, current eating pattern, and types of overeating). (See <a href=\"#H118452871\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-prevalence-screening-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Prevalence, screening, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with binge eating disorder, we suggest psychotherapy rather than behavioral weight loss therapy or pharmacotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H130122373\" class=\"local\">'Psychotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotherapies that have demonstrated efficacy for treating binge eating disorder include cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy, and dialectical behavior therapy. For patients with binge eating disorder, we suggest CBT rather than other psychotherapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). CBT has been studied more often and also has the advantage of being adapted for use in self-help formats. However, interpersonal psychotherapy is a reasonable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H130122373\" class=\"local\">'Psychotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For obese or overweight patients with binge eating disorder who do not have access to psychotherapy, decline it, or do not respond to it, we suggest behavioral weight loss therapy rather than other treatments (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, pharmacotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is a reasonable alternative, as is the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zonisamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zonisamide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisdexamfetamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisdexamfetamine</a> for patients who have marked weight problems.

When augmentation is desired, we suggest adding a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor rather than other drugs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H103239749\" class=\"local\">'Combining CBT and pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For overweight or obese patients with binge eating disorder who are primarily interested in losing weight, we suggest behavioral weight loss therapy rather than psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy may be offered to address persistent episodes of binge eating.
