Inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor genes <em>SMARCB1</em> and <em>LZTR1</em> are thought to be responsible for a majority of cases. Treatment is symptomatic, focused primarily on pain management. &nbsp;</p><p>The epidemiology, pathology, clinical manifestation, diagnosis, and treatment of schwannomatosis will be reviewed here.

There is no known predilection based on gender or race. The median age of diagnosis is approximately 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Patients with schwannomatosis account for 2 to 10 percent of all individuals undergoing schwannoma resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/1,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4-6</a>]. In a retrospective surgical series of over 200 schwannoma excisions performed over a 15-year period, 142 patients (90 percent) had solitary tumors, 2 patients (1 percent) had NF2, and 14 patients (9 percent) met diagnostic criteria for definite or probable schwannomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Schwannomatosis is most frequently sporadic, but approximately 20 percent of cases appear to be familial, as defined by one or more closely-related family members with at least one schwannoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/1,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9166943\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Schwannomas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors comprised entirely of neoplastic Schwann cells, arising from cranial nerves, spinal roots, or peripheral nerves. They are typically situated eccentrically to the nerve, displacing the nerve fibers<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. They may be encapsulated or plexiform in configuration. The hallmark pathologic feature is the presence of alternating areas of compact spindle cells arranged in compact fascicles called Antoni A areas, and less cellular and more disorganized areas called Antoni B areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51535 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While there are subtle histopathologic characteristics that can help distinguish sporadic schwannomas from those associated with an underlying syndromic diagnosis of schwannomatosis or neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), the schwannomas in schwannomatosis and NF2 appear identical microscopically. (See <a href=\"#H13669843\" class=\"local\">'Tumor pathology'</a> below.)</p><p>A clinical and pathological study in the late 1990&rsquo;s of patients with multiple schwannomas in the absence of vestibular schwannomas led to recognition that schwannomatosis was an entity distinct from NF2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Subsequent linkage studies in families with schwannomatosis identified a locus on chromosome 22 near the gene marker D22S1174, about 6 cm centromeric to the <em>NF2</em> gene. This led to the identification of inactivating germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <em>SMARCB1 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], now known to be a major predisposing gene in schwannomatosis that is present in 40 to 50 percent of families with schwannomatosis and up to 10 percent of sporadic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/8,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3813492\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p><em>SMARCB1</em>, also called <em>INI1</em>, is thought to act as a tumor suppressor gene that affects the expression of genes regulating the cell cycle, growth and differentiation. In <em>SMARCB1</em> mutation-positive schwannomas, there can be additional genetic alterations, including loss of one copy of chromosome 22 and inactivating mutations in the <em>NF2</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This suggests a four-hit, three-step model of tumorigenesis in some <em>SMARCB1</em>-associated schwannomatosis patients, in which the mutated germline <em>SMARCB1</em> gene copy is retained in the tumor (hit 1), whereas chromosome 22, or at least a segment of chromosome 22 containing the wild-type <em>SMARCB1</em> gene copy and a wild-type copy of the <em>NF2</em> gene, is lost (hits 2 and 3), followed by mutation of the remaining wild-type <em>NF2</em> gene copy (hit 4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>].</p><p>Germline mutations in <em>SMARCB1</em> also cause an inherited predisposition to rhabdoid tumors that occur in childhood, including malignant rhabdoid tumors of the kidney, atypical <span class=\"nowrap\">teratoid/rhabdoid</span> tumors <span class=\"nowrap\">(AT/RT)</span> of the central nervous system, and extra-renal rhabdoid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>]. There are rare reports of families with both schwannomatosis and rhabdoid tumor phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>], and the factors that determine the varying phenotypes are not yet known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uncommon-brain-tumors#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uncommon brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor'</a>.) </p><p>There are conflicting data about the role of <em>SMARCB1</em> mutations in patients with multiple meningiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. Somatic mutations in <em>SMARCB1</em> have been reported in less than 3 percent of sporadic meningiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>], but no germline mutations were identified in a series of 47 patients with multiple meningiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In other reports, <em>SMARCB1</em> mutations have been identified in families with schwannomatosis and multiple meningiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>Mutations in another tumor suppressor gene, <em>LZTR1</em>, appear to explain the predisposition to schwannomatosis in many patients without mutations in <em>SMARCB1 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]<em>. </em>In a study of 20 such individuals whose schwannomas involved loss of one copy of chromosome 22q (encompassing both <em>NF2</em> and <em>SMARCB1)</em>, but who were not found to have a <em>SMARCB1</em> mutation on the other copy of chromosome 22q, <em>LZTR1</em> mutations were identified in 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A larger study in <em>SMARCB1</em> and <em>NF2</em> mutation-negative individuals identified <em>LZTR1</em> mutations in 6 of 16 patients with familial schwannomatosis (38 percent), 11 of 49 sporadic patients (22 percent), and 2 of 39 patients with unilateral vestibular schwannoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. As with <em>SMARCB1-</em>related cases, the pattern of genetic alterations suggests a four-hit, three-step model of tumorigenesis in which the mutated germline <em>LZTR1</em> gene copy is retained in the tumor (hit 1), whereas a segment of chromosome 22 containing the wild-type <em>SMARCB1</em> gene copy and a wild-type copy of the <em>NF2</em> gene is lost (hits 2 and 3), followed by mutation of the remaining wild-type <em>NF2</em> gene copy (hit 4).</p><p><em>LZTR1</em> is located on chromosome 22q11.21, centromeric to both <em>SMARCB1</em> (22q11.23) and <em>NF2</em> (22q12.2). <em>LZTR1</em> has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene and a driver in a subset of glioblastomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Additionally, somatic <em>LZTR1 </em>mutations have been found in several other cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Consistent with other late-onset tumor predisposition genes, loss-of-function mutations in <em>LZTR1</em> are also seen in control populations, suggesting that <em>LZTR1</em> may exhibit reduced or incomplete penetrance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Both <em>SMARCB1</em> and <em>LZTR1 </em>are known to interact with histone deacetylase 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], which could have important therapeutic implications in schwannomatosis, since histone deacetylase inhibitors are currently under development as antitumor drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13669829\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with schwannomatosis present in adulthood with one or more symptomatic schwannomas and pain that may or may not localize to known tumors. The average age of symptom onset is 25 to 30 years, and delays in diagnosis are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/2,5,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,7,10</a>]. The disorder is thought to be familial in up to one-fifth of patients, although this may be an underestimate, as unaffected family members can harbor a shared genetic mutation in <em>SMARCB1</em> or <em>LZTR1</em>. An understanding of the phenotypic spectrum is still evolving.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H721997\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the largest cases series to date that included 87 patients meeting research or diagnostic criteria for schwannomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/4,10,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,36</a>], the following presenting features were described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median age of symptom onset was 30 years (range, 8 to 59 years), and the median age of diagnosis was 40 years (range, 16 to 70 years). Pain was the most common presenting symptom, reported by 57 percent of patients. In the majority of these patients (80 percent), pain was not associated with a discrete mass. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mass was the presenting symptom in 41 percent of patients. The mass was painless in the majority (67 percent). In two patients, a tumor was discovered incidentally during other imaging. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A family history of schwannomatosis was present in 13 percent of patients.</p><p/><p>Other symptoms reported at presentation vary based on the location of the tumors, but can include focal numbness, weakness, and muscle atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/2,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,10</a>]. Some patients may be asymptomatic and diagnosed only incidentally or as a result of a positive family history. </p><p>Chronic pain is very common in patients with schwannomatosis, affecting approximately two thirds of patients in most series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. The etiology of the pain is often complex, with a mix of neuropathic and nociceptive features. Total tumor burden, size and location do not correlate well with pain-related morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some patients experience pain that does not seem to correlate with specific tumors, and may be diffuse in nature. The pain may be difficult to manage medically and can become disabling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13669878\" class=\"local\">'Pain management'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9167193\"><span class=\"h2\">Schwannomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple schwannomas are the hallmark feature of schwannomatosis. Schwannomas are benign tumors of the nerve sheath, typically occurring as solitary, encapsulated masses on cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, or spinal roots. Schwannomas in schwannomatosis can be discrete or plexiform. </p><p>Radiographically, schwannomas and neurofibromas have a similar appearance and often cannot be distinguished by imaging. MRI is the best method for visualizing nerve sheath tumors, which typically have an intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images, very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, and uniform contrast enhancement with a low-intensity rim (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58553\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58553 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Nerve sheath tumors are particularly well visualized on short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) sequences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F89496\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89496 \">picture 2</a>). A heterogeneous appearance with cystic degeneration can also be seen and is more typical of schwannoma than neurofibroma. </p><p>Nearly all patients with schwannomatosis have one or more peripheral nerve schwannomas, which are most often located within the arms or legs. Peripheral nerve schwannomas are commonly found in the head and neck region, and can also be seen in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.</p><p>Nonvestibular cranial nerve schwannomas have been reported in up to 10 percent of patients. Unilateral vestibular schwannomas are uncommon but have been reported, primarily in the setting of <em>LZTR1</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/2,31,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31,38,39</a>]. Symptoms of cranial nerve schwannomas depend upon the nerve involved. As an example, a trigeminal schwannoma typically presents with pain, numbness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paresthesias in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve.</p><p>Spinal nerve root schwannomas are present in approximately 75 percent of patients; the lumbar spine appears to be the most common location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77534\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77534 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one series, spinal tumors were localized to a single area of the spine (ie, cervical, thoracic or lumbar) in approximately half of patients, involving two areas on one third, and the entire spine in a small minority. Spinal nerve root schwannomas usually arise from the dorsal sensory roots and present with radicular sensory changes (pain, paresthesias). Radiculopathy with motor manifestations is not common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradural-nerve-sheath-tumors#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradural nerve sheath tumors&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.). &#160;</p><p>Subcutaneous schwannomas are seen in 20 to 30 percent of patients, usually less than five in number [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Subcutaneous schwannomas are palpable or visible masses located beneath the skin, and when palpated, the skin moves freely over the mass. This is in contrast with cutaneous or intradermal schwannomas, which are common in NF2 but are not part of the phenotype of schwannomatosis; cutaneous schwannomas are located within the skin itself, move with the skin when palpated, and often protrude superficially. Not all subcutaneous masses in patients with schwannomatosis are schwannomas; in one series, pathologically proven lipomas, angiolipomas, and cutaneous neurofibromas were also seen in a small number of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Anatomically-limited or segmental disease, defined as multiple schwannomas limited to a single limb or two spinal segments, is described in approximately 30 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The overall tumor burden in patients with schwannomatosis has not been well characterized and is difficult to assess clinically, since some tumors may be internal and asymptomatic. In a study of whole-body MRI that included 51 patients with schwannomatosis, 36 patients had one or more internal tumors visualized by MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]. The median tumor count in patients with tumors was 4 (range, 1 to 27 tumors) and the median whole-body tumor volume was 39 mL (range, 7 to 1372 mL). Internal tumors were discrete appearing in 81 percent of patients, plexiform in 8 percent, and both discrete and plexiform in 11 percent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2126688\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to schwannomas, patients with schwannomatosis may also be at increased risk for other tumors. </p><p>The incidence of meningioma in patients with schwannomatosis was 5 percent in one large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There have been several documented families with germline <em>SMARCB1</em> mutations who manifest schwannomatosis as well as multiple meningiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST) have been reported in a small number of patients with schwannomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>]. The overall risk of malignant transformation is not well established, however, in part because the pathologic diagnosis of malignant nerve sheath tumors can be challenging. In the largest cohort of schwannomatosis patients described to date, three out of 87 patients (3 percent) were diagnosed with MPNST; upon subsequent neuropathologic review, however, all three tumors were reclassified (two as schwannoma, one as melanoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Rare families with both multiple schwannomas and rhabdoid tumors, including atypical <span class=\"nowrap\">teratoid/rhabdoid</span> tumors (ATRT) of the central nervous system, in the presence of a germline mutation in <em>SMARCB1</em>, have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9166943\" class=\"local\">'Pathology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13669836\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of schwannomatosis should be considered in a patient presenting with multiple schwannomas, particularly in the presence of an affected family member.

When surgery is necessary, indications include medically refractory local pain, spinal cord compression, or impingement of other organs. Surgical therapy for schwannomatosis is highly individualized and is dependent on the size, location and complexity of tumors, the need for pathologic conformation for diagnosis, the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progression of neurologic or systemic symptoms, and pain. &#160;</p><p>Surgical resection of these tumors is often complex and may put patients at risk of additional neurologic compromise. The goals of surgery should be explicitly discussed with the patient. In general, the goal of surgery is to prevent progression of symptoms as neurologic dysfunction is unlikely to be reversed by tumor resection. If pain is the primary indication, patients should be counseled that, though surgery may relieve pain, it is also possible that it will be ineffective or could even worsen pain and dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13669906\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal type and frequency of surveillance imaging has not been established in schwannomatosis. Tumors that are asymptomatic are not typically followed with serial imaging unless they are considered to be high risk for future neurologic compromise, such as extradural spinal schwannomas causing spinal cord compression or intracranial schwannomas. Others have suggested performing brain and spine MRI every two to three years in all patients starting at age 10 for those with <em>SMARCB1</em> mutations and age 15 to 19 for those with <em>LZTR1</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. For symptomatic tumors, the frequency of the imaging is dependent on the severity of symptoms and evidence of progression, but typically is done once yearly at a minimum. For many patients with tumors in multiple body regions, we use whole-body MRI at the time of diagnosis to establish the location of tumors and then serially for monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3813492\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic testing is not required for the diagnosis of schwannomatosis. Aside from <em>SMARCB1</em> and <em>LZTR1</em>, there are likely other causative genes and molecular regulatory mechanisms in schwannomatosis that have not yet been identified, which limits the ability of genetic testing to exclude the diagnosis of schwannomatosis. Additionally, genetic testing for schwannomatosis is not yet helpful in determining prognosis or informing medical management.</p><p>The decision to pursue genetic testing for <em>SMARCB1</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>LZTR1</em> is individualized and depends on a variety of factors, including the age and reproductive status of the patient, the presence or absence of additional family members who might be at risk, the cost of the test and insurance coverage, and whether there are other affected family members. In addition, genetic test results can be important for reproductive decision making. The protocol for genetic testing in the setting of schwannomatosis can also be complex in terms of determining the appropriate tissue to submit for testing given the individual and family history information, coordinating testing for the <em>NF2</em>, <em>SMARCB1</em>, and <em>LZTR1</em> genes, and interpreting results accurately. </p><p>In our experience, many patients do not elect to have <em>SMARCB1</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>LZTR1</em> testing. Those that most frequently pursue testing are women of child-bearing age or affected parents of unaffected children who desire the ability to test their children at some point in the future. If genetic testing for schwannomatosis is being considered, referral to a genetic counselor who is knowledgeable about the testing protocol and the relevant issues for discussion with patients and their families is strongly recommended. (See <a href=\"#H723040\" class=\"local\">'Counseling and prognosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic testing&quot;, section on 'Principles of genetic testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H723040\"><span class=\"h1\">COUNSELING AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with schwannomatosis are at risk of having other affected family members, including children. For individuals with a known germline <em>SMARCB1</em> or <em>LZTR1</em> mutation, the transmission risk to offspring is 50 percent. For individuals with no known <em>SMARCB1</em> or <em>LZTR1 </em>mutation who have an affected parent, the transmission risk is also considered to be 50 percent. For individuals with no affected parent and no known mutation (ie, sporadic schwannomatosis), the recurrence risk is less than 15 percent, but not zero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/schwannomatosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This is because schwannomatosis is probably not fully penetrant, meaning that individuals can carry a genetic mutation that causes schwannomatosis but never develop the condition. Rates of non-penetrance and mosaicism are not yet well characterized.</p><p>Patients diagnosed with schwannomatosis are counseled to consider sharing the diagnosis with family members, particularly those who have symptoms consistent with the condition. Asymptomatic family members can be screened with whole body MRI or genetic testing (if a mutation has been identified within the family), but should first be counseled about issues regarding presymptomatic testing and the possible impact on insurability (health and life) based on the results of screening.
