They are also referred to as AV septal defects, endocardial cushion defects, or persistent AV ostium. Combinations of these anatomic abnormalities result in complete (both atrial and ventricular septal defects <span class=\"nowrap\">[ASD/VSD])</span> and partial (only ASD) forms that are manifested in varying clinical presentations.</p><p>The anatomy, pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of AV canal defects will be reviewed here. The management and outcome of patients with AV canal defects are discussed separately.

AV canal defects in fetuses accounted for a larger proportion of detected congenital heart disease (CHD), approaching 18 percent of CHD cases based on data from large fetal echocardiographic series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The male-to-female distribution of AV canal defect is approximately equal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and complete AV canal defects with both atrial and ventricular septal defects occur in half of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>There is a strong association between AV canal defects and trisomy 21 (also referred to as Down syndrome), with a 40 to 50 percent risk of Down syndrome in fetuses in whom an AV canal defect is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Nonsyndromic AV canal defects appear to be associated with maternal diabetes and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21118024\" class=\"local\">'Trisomy 21'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450999423\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450999431\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AV canal defects encompass a broad range of AV septal defects and abnormalities of the AV valves. An initial classification separates the different types of AV canal defects based on anatomical features (eg, complete versus partial form) and their impact on physiology. In addition, variations of complete AV canal defects are categorized by AV valve morphology (Rastelli classification) and relative ventricular size. These classifications are used to guide surgical management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450999438\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete, partial, intermediate, and transitional forms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AV canal defects are initially divided between complete (which contain <strong>both </strong>atrial and ventricular septal defects <span class=\"nowrap\">[ASD/VSD])</span> and partial defects (which have an atrial septal but <strong>no </strong>ventricular septal defect). Two other forms are subtypes of complete AV canal defects and include transitional (physiologically similar to the partial subtype) and intermediate (physiologically similar to the complete subtype) defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86346 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete AV canal defect is a result of complete failure of fusion between the superior and inferior endocardial cushions. It is characterized by a primum ASD that is contiguous with a posterior (or inlet) VSD, and a common AV valve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial AV canal defect is due to incomplete fusion of the superior and inferior endocardial cushions and consists of a primum ASD, and a single AV valve annulus with two separate valve orifices. Due to abnormal fusion of the left tubercle of the superior and inferior cushions, the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve typically is cleft.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transitional AV canal defect is anatomically a subtype of complete AV canal defect as it consists of a large primum defect, cleft mitral valve, and inlet VSD. However, dense chordal attachments to the ventricular septum lead to small insignificant ventricular shunting and delineation of distinct left and right AV valve orifices, resulting in a defect that is similar to the physiology of a partial AV canal defect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate AV canal defect is a rare subtype of complete AV canal defect, in which a bridging tongue of tissue divides the common AV valve into two distinct orifices. This defect is similar to a complete AV canal defect and usually has both a large primum atrial and inlet ventricular septal defects. Due to the natural division of the common AV valve into left and right AV valve components by the tongue of tissue, surgical division is not required.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450999445\"><span class=\"h2\">Rastelli classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classification system initially developed and revised by Rastelli and others is used to describe the anatomy of the superior bridging leaflet of the common AV valve in patients with a complete AV defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The common AV valve is composed of five leaflets: left superior and inferior bridging leaflets, a left lateral leaflet, right anterior leaflet, and right lateral leaflet. The superior bridging leaflet is more variable in its size and attachments than the other four leaflets. Initially, the Rastelli classification was important in describing morphological details of the AV valve that was used for surgical repair. However, over time, the clinical and surgical significance of the Rastelli classification has become less important (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86329 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rastelli type A defects are the most common form and are frequently found in patients who have Down syndrome. In this form, the superior bridging leaflet is committed to the left ventricle (LV) with chordal attachments to the crest of the ventricular septum. It shares a commissure with the anterior tricuspid leaflet at the ventricular septum. Interventricular shunting may occur between the anterior and posterior bridging leaflets and underneath the anterior leaflet in the interchordal spaces.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rastelli type B is the least common form, in which the superior bridging leaflet extends into the right ventricle (RV) with a corresponding decrease in size of the anterior tricuspid leaflet and with chordal attachments into the body of the RV. Because of the lack of chordal insertions to the septum, interventricular shunting occurs under the superior bridging leaflet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rastelli type C is frequently found in combination with other cardiac defects, such as tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), transposition of the great arteries (TGA), and heterotaxy syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In this form, the superior bridging leaflet is even larger and has no chordal attachment to the interventricular septum, referred to as &quot;free floating&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450999452\"><span class=\"h2\">Balanced/unbalanced classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete AV canal defects can also be classified based on the relative sizes of the ventricles. In a balanced complete AV canal defect, the ventricles are relatively equal in size and are amenable to two-ventricular surgical correction. In the unbalanced form, there is hypoplasia of either the RV or LV. In most unbalanced cases, the RV is the dominant ventricle. If there is significant hypoplasia of either ventricle, complete two-ventricle surgical repair may not be possible, and palliative procedures need to be considered. Echocardiographic features such as indices of valve distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], LV inflow index (a measure of flow into the LV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and the RV-LV inflow angle to the ventricular septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] are used to determine the possibility of successful two-ventricle repair of unbalanced AV canal defects versus the need to pursue a single ventricle palliative approach.

At four to five weeks of gestation, the superior and inferior endocardial cushions of the common AV canal fuse and contribute to the formation of the AV valves (ie, mitral and tricuspid valves) and the AV septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86165\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86165 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21118091\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy of AV canal defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure of these cushions to fuse correctly results in a broad range of AV septal defects and abnormalities of the AV valves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86338\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86338 \">figure 4</a>). In patients with AV canal defects, the AV valve(s) is displaced apically and the inlet portion of the ventricular septum appears &quot;scooped out,&quot; resulting in a shorter distance from the crux to the apex of the heart than from apex to the aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete failure of fusion between the superior and inferior endocardial cushions results in both large atrial (primum atrial septal defect [ASD]) and ventricular septal defects (VSD) (due to a deficiency of the inlet portion of the interventricular septum), and a single common AV valve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incomplete or partial lack of fusion between the superior and inferior cushions results in a partial AV canal defect with a primum ASD, a common valvular annulus with two separate AV valve orifices, and a cleft in the anterior mitral leaflet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H779748176\"><span class=\"h3\">AV valve abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For both complete and partial AV canal defects, the AV valve(s) is usually abnormal, resulting in regurgitation. Over time, the valve leaflets become more thickened, with prolapse of leaflet tissue and worsening regurgitation. Even after repair, the continued presence of AV valve regurgitation is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H779748114\"><span class=\"h4\">Complete AV canal defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with complete AV canal defects have a single AV valve, which is often associated with regurgitation. Regurgitation through the common valve may be from left ventricle (LV) to left atrium (LA) or right ventricle (RV) to right atrium (RA). It can exacerbate volume overload and contribute to heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90983938\"><span class=\"h4\">Partial AV canal defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mitral valve in partial AV canal defects is almost always abnormal. There is usually a cleft of the anterior leaflet, which is often associated with mitral regurgitation (MR). Regurgitation is most common from the LV to LA through the cleft in the anterior mitral valve leaflet. However, regurgitation can also occur from the LV to RA through the AV septum, resulting in a &quot;left ventricle to right atrium shunt,&quot; and right atrial and right ventricular volume overload.</p><p>Double-orifice mitral valve is an uncommon but surgically important abnormality. It is found in approximately 4 to 5 percent of all patients with AV canal defects. The combined effective opening of a double orifice mitral valve is always less than that of a valve with a single orifice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Double-orifice mitral valve is a risk factor for poor surgical outcome because of significant regurgitation. However, combining the two orifices by incising bridging tissue is not optimal as it also commonly results in significant left AV valve (mitral) regurgitation.</p><p>A parachute mitral valve is associated with papillary muscle abnormalities. The papillary muscles in AV canal defects are usually abnormal in size and location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The LV papillary muscles in AV canal defects are typically shifted laterally and closer together compared with their usual location. On occasion, only one LV papillary muscle may be present, resulting in parachute mitral valve deformity. In such a patient, traditional repair with closure of the cleft may result in postoperative mitral valve stenosis or disruption of the mitral valve tensor apparatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90983827\"><span class=\"h3\">Left ventricular outflow tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The combined changes of valve position and septal deficiency increase the distance between the aorta and the apex of the heart, resulting in an elongation of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). This anatomic change is visualized by echocardiography and angiography as a gooseneck deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86328\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86328 \">image 1</a>). Although the LVOT appears elongated and narrow, in most cases, there is no obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When LVOT obstruction occurs, it typically presents in patients with partial AV canal defect, because the superior bridging leaflet is frequently bound tightly to the septal crest causing the LVOT to be longer and more narrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86335\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86335 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Other potential sources of the LVOT obstruction include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accessory papillary muscle extending to the LVOT</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discrete subaortic membrane</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aneurysm of membranous ventricular septum into the outflow region</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic arch hypoplasia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic coarctation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8312591\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated cardiac defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other cardiac defects are frequently found in patients with AV canal defects, such as tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). In particular, commonly associated cardiac lesions in patients with complete AV canal defects include transposition of the great arteries (TGA), heterotaxy syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), coarctation of the aorta, secundum ASDs, absent atrial septum, muscular VSDs, persistent left superior vena cava, and anomalous pulmonary venous return [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Pulmonary and systemic venous abnormalities may also be associated with AV canal defects as a part of the heterotaxy syndrome (a rare condition in which the usual position of the heart and other organs are reversed as mirror images of the normal location [ie, situs inversus]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11984932\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AV canal defects are thought to be caused by a disruption of the normal development of the endocardial cushions due to an underlying genetic defect or predisposition.

Fetuses in whom an AV canal defect is detected have a 40 to 50 percent risk of Down syndrome. Conversely, approximately 40 percent of fetuses with trisomy 21 have an AV canal defect, usually the complete form. In addition, the combination of AV canal defect and tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is highly suggestive of Down syndrome, as 75 percent of patients with both defects have Down syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Based on molecular mapping of small regions of duplication on chromosome 21, the region at 21q22.1-qter has been designated an AV canal critical region (also referred to as the Down syndrome critical region) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Color-flow Doppler evaluation effectively identifies the magnitude and direction of shunting. Although direction of shunting is usually left to right across the PDA, in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), right-to-left shunt occurs at the ductal level.

Cardiac catheterization may be required for the assessment of PVR in the older child when pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (PVOD) is suspected.

This clinical difference usually resolves with 100 percent oxygen administration. For patients who have upper airway obstruction, endotracheal intubation and ventilation to a normal carbon dioxide level may be necessary to determine PVR accurately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis-of-atrioventricular-av-canal-defects/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].

Because of the high incidence of chromosomal abnormalities associated with this defect, we suggest that fetal genetic analysis be performed when an antenatal diagnosis of AV canal defect is made (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

Excessive pulmonary blood flow typically leads to heart failure, which presents with symptoms of tachypnea, sweating, and pallor. In younger patients, findings will also include poor feeding and growth retardation. Unrepaired defects will eventually cause elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and subsequent pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH).
