It most often affects children between the ages of 2 and 5, but it can affect older people, too.</p><p>Acute cerebellar ataxia usually happens in response to an infection that causes fever. The symptoms of acute cerebellar ataxia usually go away on their own within 2 to 3 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2296163\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of acute cerebellar ataxia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is usually trouble walking, but other movement problems can also occur. Some children also develop:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jumpy or flicking eyeball movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble speaking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2296178\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. If your child has symptoms of acute cerebellar ataxia, the doctor or nurse will want to make sure those symptoms are not caused by a more serious problem, such as brain damage. He or she will ask a lot of questions about your child's symptoms and medical history. As part of the exam, the doctor or nurse will also need to watch how your child responds to different things and how he or she moves.</p><p>The doctor or nurse might also order:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to check for poisons or drugs (for example, if there is a chance the child accidentally swallowed something)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to check for low blood sugar, or other problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests to check for problems in the brain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2296193\"><span class=\"h1\">How is acute cerebellar ataxia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cerebellar ataxia usually gets better on its own without treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2296208\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to help my child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Give your child a lot of support. Let him or her know that things will get better. Also, keep a close watch on your child's symptoms and let the doctor know if they get worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2296223\"><span class=\"h1\">Can acute cerebellar ataxia be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can lower the chances that your child will get acute cerebellar ataxia by making sure he or she has all the right vaccines. Some of the infections that lead to acute cerebellar ataxia (such as chickenpox, measles, and mumps) can be prevented with vaccines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2296238\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chickenpox-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chickenpox (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=roseola-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Roseola (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chickenpox-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chickenpox prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
