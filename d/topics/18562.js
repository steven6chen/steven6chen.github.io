It can damage the blood vessels and keep them from carrying blood to body parts that need it. Vasculitis can affect many different parts of the body.</p><p>There are many different types of vasculitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F85669\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85669 \">table 1</a>). Some are mild, and others are serious or even life-threatening.</p><p>Vasculitis sometimes happens with another disease, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. But vasculitis can also happen in people without other health problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830249672\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of vasculitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tiredness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle and joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of appetite &ndash; Some people with vasculitis lose weight without trying to.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brown or dark-colored urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness, weakness, or pain in the hands, feet, or other parts of the body</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830249704\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Vasculitis symptoms can be a lot like symptoms of other diseases, so tests are important to help doctors learn the cause of symptoms. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood and urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests &ndash; These can include X-rays or an MRI. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve conduction studies &ndash; These tests check whether nerves are carrying electrical signals the way they are supposed to. They can show nerve damage caused by vasculitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung function tests &ndash; These tests measure how much air you can blow out of your lungs and how fast you can blow. They can show lung damage caused by vasculitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called a &quot;biopsy&quot; &ndash; In this test, a doctor takes a small sample of tissue from an affected body part. Another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope. This test can show signs of vasculitis and help doctors learn what type of vasculitis someone has.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test called an &quot;arteriogram&quot; &ndash; In this test, a doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in a leg or arm. He or she moves the tube into blood vessels in the affected body part, such as the heart. Then the doctor injects a dye that shows up on an X-ray. The dye helps show changes in blood vessels caused by vasculitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830249719\"><span class=\"h1\">How is vasculitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on the type of vasculitis you have. Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">prednisone</a> &ndash; These medicines can reduce or control inflammation. Because steroid medicines can cause serious side effects, doctors try to give them for as short a time as possible. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strong medicines that &quot;turn off&quot; the immune system, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">cyclophosphamide</a> (brand name: Procytox) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rituximab</a> (brand name: Rituxan) &ndash; These medicines can be taken along with steroid medicines. Doctors use them to treat the most severe vasculitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines that partly &quot;turn off&quot; the immune system, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">azathioprine</a> (sample brand names: Azasan, Imuran), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">methotrexate</a> (sample brand names: Rheumatrex, Trexall) &ndash; These are not as strong as medicines like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">cyclophosphamide</a>. Doctors use them to treat less severe types of vasculitis, or to switch patients off of cyclophosphamide after the worst of their symptoms are controlled.</p><p/><p>Vasculitis can sometimes be caused by a reaction to certain medicines. If you get it, stopping the medicine might be the only treatment you need.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830249734\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor or nurse. Some medicines for vasculitis are not safe to take while pregnant. You might need to get symptoms under control or switch medicines before you try to get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830249749\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with vasculitis need regular exams and tests to check for problems the vasculitis can cause. It is important to take medicines exactly as prescribed and tell the doctor or nurse about any side effects. The right treatment can help you control the symptoms and stay as healthy as possible.</p><p>Even though some types of vasculitis are very serious, doctors and nurses today know a lot about how to handle vasculitis, and many people with vasculitis live a long time. Sometimes, symptoms even go away for long periods of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830249764\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kawasaki disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarteritis-nodosa-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Polyarteritis nodosa (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyalgia-rheumatica-and-giant-cell-arteritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-steroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Oral steroid medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=behcet-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Beh&ccedil;et syndrome (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripheral-artery-disease-and-claudication-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Peripheral artery disease and claudication (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasculitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vasculitis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
