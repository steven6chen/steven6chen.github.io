The disease is far less common than other inflammatory conditions of the thyroid gland, including subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (which results from a viral infection of the gland) and chronic thyroiditis (which is usually autoimmune in nature). The signs and symptoms of ST may mimic these and other noninfectious inflammatory conditions. Recognition of the clinical and bacteriological features of ST is essential for prompt management.</p><p>The primary treatment for ST is antimicrobial therapy, directed against the likely bacterial pathogens. Although most cases of ST are caused by aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria are increasingly recognized as a cause of ST, and this has led to revision of treatment protocols for this condition. Rarely, mycobacteria, fungi, or other nonbacterial pathogens may cause a subacute form of suppurative thyroiditis.</p><p>The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children are discussed here; subacute forms of suppurative thyroiditis are discussed briefly. The diagnosis and treatment of other inflammatory conditions of the thyroid gland, including subacute granulomatous thyroiditis and chronic thyroiditis, are discussed separately.

The rarity of thyroid infection has been explained by the high concentration of iodine within the gland, ample supply of blood and lymphatics, and the anatomical isolation of the gland from other neck structures. This isolation is due to the capsule around the thyroid gland and the lack of direct communication with neighboring structures. All of these features make the thyroid gland relatively resistant to infection by direct extension from contiguous sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8659811\"><span class=\"h2\">Pyriform sinus fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, a fistula from the pyriform sinus associated with a third or fourth branchial arch anomaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] is a common route through which bacteria infect the thyroid gland (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89871\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89871 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. This type of fistula extends from the pharynx to the thyroid capsule and is almost always left-sided; the anomaly is particularly likely to be found in children with recurrent or left-sided ST. For a child with a pyriform sinus fistula presenting with a first episode of suppurative thyroiditis, the risk of recurrent thyroiditis has not been established, but appears to be high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other predisposing conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other routes through which the thyroid may become infected include a thyroglossal duct remnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], congenital branchial fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], hematogenous spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], direct spread from an adjacent site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], or perforated esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The prevalence of infection with methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Other aerobic bacteria are <em>Klebsiella</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Streptococcus viridans</em>, <em>Arcanobacterium haemolyticum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], <em>Eikenella corrodens </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], <em>Salmonella</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and Enterobacteriaceae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p>When anaerobic bacteria are isolated from the infected thyroid they tend to be members of the oropharyngeal flora, and may spread to the gland in a similar fashion as the aerobic pathogens of similar origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2,10,12-14,16,19,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,10,12-14,16,19,29</a>].</p><p>The frequency of infection with anaerobic bacteria in ST is unknown because adequate methodologies for the recovery of anaerobic bacteria were not uniformly employed in all past studies. One report described two children with recurrent episodes of acute ST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli and <em>Peptostreptococcus</em> species were recovered from these patients' infected thyroid glands. Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli (eg, <em>Prevotella</em>, <em>Porphyromonas</em>, and <em>Fusobacterium </em>species) are increasingly recognized as a cause of ST, and a growing number of strains are penicillin-resistant. These resistant organisms are particularly common among patients recently treated with penicillin, due to induction of beta-lactamase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. <em>Bacteroides</em> and <em>Actinomyces</em> species have also been reported in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29</a>].

The recovery of anaerobes in ST has also been associated with postabortal sepsis, subphrenic abscess, pilonidal abscess, urinary tract infection, and perforation of the esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,16,19</a>].</p><p>Organisms that are rarely recovered from patients with ST, which can cause chronic or insidious infection, especially in patients with HIV disease, include <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], atypical mycobacteria, <em>Salmonella</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], <em>Aspergillus</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], <em>Coccidioides immitis</em>, <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, <em>Candida</em> species, <em>Nocardia</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], <em>Treponema pallidum</em>, <em>Echinococcus</em> species, and <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (carinii) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2,16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,16,19</a>]. <em>P. jirovecii</em> thyroiditis is found almost exclusively in patients with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] or in those with underlying malignancy. Rarely, the thyroid is involved in disseminated strongyloidiasis, and cysticercosis.</p><p>Viruses have been associated with thyroiditis, but these tend to cause a subacute form. Viruses that have been implicated in this disorder include measles, influenza, enterovirus, Epstein-Barr, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, echovirus, mumps, and St. Louis encephalitis viruses. Other implicated infections include malaria, Q fever, and the cat-scratch disease agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroiditis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroiditis&quot;, section on 'Subacute thyroiditis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of acute ST present with a sudden onset of pain, and firm, tender, red, warm swelling in the anterior aspect of the neck that moves on swallowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There may be associated fever, chills, local warmth, erythema, hoarseness, sore throat, dysphagia, and dysphonia. The symptoms develop over days to a few weeks. Many cases arise shortly after an apparent upper respiratory tract infection or pharyngitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Neck pain often is unilateral and radiates to the mandible, ears, or occiput. Neck flexion reduces the severity of the pain. The pain worsens with neck hyperextension. Other signs that are related to pressure upon the neck muscle include involuntary depression of the chin upon swallowing and limitation of cervical extension.</p><p>Symptoms of ST may be present from days to months (mean 18 days) prior to the establishment of diagnosis. Symptoms in those with tuberculous thyroiditis are present for a mean interval of 105 days (range, 14 days to 1 year).</p><p>On examination, the thyroid gland is swollen and tender. A single lobe, both lobes, or only the isthmus of the thyroid may be involved, so that the swelling and tenderness may be bilateral or unilateral. In one series of ST in children, the infection preferentially involved the left lobe in 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rarely, a thyroid abscess can be manifested as a pulsatile mass. Erythema develops over the gland, and regional lymphadenopathy may be present as the disease progresses. Fluctuance may develop later, if an abscess forms. Case reports have described ST presenting with hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The hyperthyroidism can be explained by the release of pre-synthesized and stored thyroid hormone into the circulation as a result of inflammation and disruption of the thyroid follicles.</p><p>Pain, fever, and tenderness are less often observed in patients with tuberculous thyroiditis as compared to those with acute bacterial infection. The diagnosis of fungal and parasitic thyroiditis is generally first made at surgery. P. carinii thyroiditis has no specific clinical features except that most individuals suffer from HIV and present with a diffuse tender goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ST should be differentiated from other more common thyroid conditions such as adenoma, goiter, or subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. Making this distinction can be difficult, particularly early in the course of the disease. As compared to acute ST, subacute granulomatous thyroiditis may present with identical local signs, but systemic manifestations are less severe. Subacute thyroiditis usually subsides over time, whereas untreated acute ST generally results in increasing toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,37</a>]. Other conditions that should be differentiated from ST are intracystic hemorrhage, malignancy, and (rarely) painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid malignancy can present as ST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroiditis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroiditis&quot;, section on 'Subacute thyroiditis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired hypothyroidism in childhood and adolescence&quot;, section on 'Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto&rsquo;s) thyroiditis'</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of neck pain resembling ST may occur in children with cervical lymphadenitis, although the tenderness is less likely to be localized to the thyroid. The differential diagnosis and evaluation of the child with prominent lymphadenitis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-lymphadenitis-in-children-diagnostic-approach-and-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical lymphadenitis in children: Diagnostic approach and initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ST can be supported by laboratory investigations. The serum thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are generally normal. In a series of children with thyroiditis, 93 percent had normal thyroid function tests, 4 percent were slightly hyperthyroid, and 2 percent were slightly hypothyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thyroid function depends in part on the etiology and time course of the thyroiditis. In a series of adults with ST, 83 percent of patients with bacterial thyroiditis had normal thyroid function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By contrast, patients with fungal thyroiditis were likely to be hypothyroid (62 percent), and those with mycobacterial infections were most likely to be hyperthyroid (50 percent). Hypothyroidism also has been reported in several patients with P. carinii infection of the thyroid, in association with HIV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,39,40</a>].</p><p>Leukocytosis, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein are usually present in acute bacterial thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate is also seen in subacute granulomatous thyroiditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest evaluating patients with suspected ST with an ultrasound of the neck. In ST, the ultrasound often reveals unilobular swelling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abscess formation. These findings assist in the differentiation of ST from other causes of anterior neck pain and fever. Sonography of acute&nbsp;suppurative thyroiditis generally reveals a unifocal perithyroidal hypoechoic space, and an effacement of the plane between the thyroid and perithyroid tissues. Atrophy and an unclear hypoechoic or low-density area in and around the affected lobe are observed in the late inflammatory stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Sonography also is helpful in detecting spread to contiguous structures, in defining the anatomy if surgical exploration is planned, and allows radiographically-guided drainage of a thyroid abscess if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Culture'</a> below.)</p><p>Computed tomography imaging (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the neck are generally not needed unless the ultrasound fails to establish the diagnosis, or if the clinical course suggests extension of a thyroid abscess to other locations such as the mediastinum. Like ultrasonography, CT may be used to exclude the possibility of cervical abscess outside the thyroid capsule.</p><p>We also suggest performing lateral soft tissue radiographs of the neck. In ST, these may show evidence of tissue edema, and the tracheal air column may be deviated or compressed. Plain radiographs can be useful in detecting free gas in the tissues produced by gas-forming bacteria, or the presence of calcifications associated with Echinococcus or Pneumocystis infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The presence of soft-tissue gas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> foul-smelling pus suggests the presence of an anaerobic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>A radionuclide thyroid scan is not necessary for the diagnosis of ST except in cases in which the diagnosis is unclear. When performed, it often shows absent or decreased uptake, with a patchy uptake or a cold area in the affected thyroid lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3473668\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation for pyriform sinus fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all children with recurrent or left-sided thyroiditis, we recommend a careful evaluation for a pyriform sinus fistula. We also suggest this evaluation for other children with unexplained ST (ie, those presenting with their first episode and without left-sided disease), as up to 70 percent will have a pyriform sinus fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Because of the wide range of different bacteria that can cause bacterial thyroiditis, antibiotics with a broad antimicrobial spectrum are indicated, at least until culture results are available. Most patients should be treated parenterally, particularly if there is any evidence of toxicity. Antibiotics should be selected to provide adequate coverage for <em>S. aureus</em> (including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> [MRSA]) and <em>S. pyogenes</em>, as well as penicillin-resistant anaerobic gram-negative bacilli and <em>Peptostreptococcus</em>. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Each of the following regimens provides appropriate broad-spectrum coverage for the organisms likely to cause acute ST and is appropriate for initial empiric therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Clindamycin</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A penicillin with a beta-lactamase inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin</a> with clavulanate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a> with sulbactam or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin</a> with tazobactam)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A carbapenem (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">imipenem</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">meropenem</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metronidazole</a> with either a macrolide or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin</a></p><p/><p>For patients with an abscess that can be aspirated, the selection of empiric antibiotic therapy can be guided initially by the results of a Gram stain of the aspirated pus.

Drainage should be carried out if clinical examination or radiographic findings by <span class=\"nowrap\">ultrasound/CT</span> scan suggest an abscess or if there is evidence of gas formation. If extensive necrosis develops, or if the infection persists despite adequate antibiotics (as evidenced by leukocytosis, continued fever, and progressive signs of local inflammation), thyroid lobectomy may be needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,6,37,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,37,42</a>]. In this case, debridement of necrotic tissue should be performed, and the wound allowed to heal by secondary intention.</p><p>Management of the predisposing conditions is of great importance. Because of an apparently high risk for recurrent infections in individuals with a pyriform sinus fistula or thyroglossal duct remnant, most authors recommend obliteration of these structures if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6,7,45,46,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,45,46,54</a>].

More recently, several small case series report management of the fistula using endoscopic cauterization, with successful obliteration of the fistula in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suppurative-thyroiditis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45,47,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,47,54</a>].</p><p>Patients should also be evaluated and treated for preexisting thyroid pathology, such as goiter and adenomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis following appropriate medical and surgical therapy for ST is generally excellent.

L-thyroxine replacement therapy may be needed in those with transient or prolonged hypothyroidism, which is most likely to occur in individuals with severe, diffuse inflammation and necrosis of the gland. </p><p>In a subset of patients, ST is caused by an occult pyriform sinus fistula, and these patients are at risk for recurrent ST unless that fistula is identified and surgically closed.

The condition is rare, but potentially life-threatening. Most patients have predisposing conditions. Pyriform sinus fistulas are present in up to 70 percent of children with acute suppurative thyroiditis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8659811\" class=\"local\">'Pyriform sinus fistula'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute forms of suppurative thyroiditis may be caused by infections with mycobacteria or fungi, particularly in immunocompromised patients. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children generally present with the acute onset of pain and tender swelling in the anterior aspect of the neck that develops over days to a few weeks, often associated with fever and leukocytosis. The infection preferentially involves the left lobe in 90 percent of cases, but may be bilateral. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid function tests are usually normal in acute suppurative thyroiditis, but hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism may develop in patients with a subacute course. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected suppurative thyroiditis should be evaluated with ultrasonography. This will assess for abscess formation and for possible extension of the infection into adjacent structures. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All children with recurrent or left-sided acute suppurative thyroiditis should be evaluated for a possible pyriform sinus fistula, using a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> esophagram or direct laryngoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F89871\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89871 \">image 1</a>). We also suggest this evaluation for children presenting with their first episode of thyroiditis or bilateral involvement of the thyroid. (See <a href=\"#H3473668\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for pyriform sinus fistula'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is clinical or sonographic evidence of abscess formation, we recommend needle aspiration of the mass for culture and cytology. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration can be helpful. The specimen should be stained and cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Culture'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with presumed suppurative thyroiditis should be treated promptly with antibiotics. For initial empiric therapy, we suggest a regimen that provides coverage for aerobic and anaerobic mouth organisms including <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>S. pyogenes</em>, gram-negative anaerobic bacilli, and <em>Peptostreptococcus</em> species (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Appropriate antibiotic regimens include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clindamycin</a> alone, or the combination of penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor, or the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metronidazole</a> and a macrolide. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In cases where an abscess forms, surgical drainage may be necessary. For children with a pyriform sinus fistula, we suggest obliteration of the fistulous tract, using surgical excision or endoscopic cauterization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
