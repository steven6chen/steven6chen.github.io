Complications from bone metastases include pain, decreased performance status, and decreased quality of life (QOL), as well as skeletal-related events (SREs), which are defined as the need for radiation or surgery to bone, pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. SREs are most common in patients with lytic metastases, but they can also occur in patients with blastic metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54124 \">table 1</a>). SREs that are accompanied by symptoms (as opposed to identified on imaging tests) are known as symptomatic skeletal events and represent a more clinically meaningful endpoint. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis#H2002100094\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of adult patients with bone metastasis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis#H2002101208\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of adult patients with bone metastasis&quot;, section on 'Distribution'</a>.)</p><p>SREs are clinical outcomes that can be distinctly measured; therefore, they are often used as endpoints in clinical trials investigating therapies for bone metastases, although not all studies include hypercalcemia of malignancy. Bone metastases are also associated with pain, particularly with motion, which significantly impacts QOL. However, the definition of an SRE does not include pain or changes in QOL, which are typically measured as separate outcomes in clinical trials. </p><p>Osteoclast inhibition has become an important component of managing patients with bone metastases to reduce the frequency and delay the onset of SREs. While the frequency of SREs in patients not treated with an osteoclast inhibitor can be illustrated by the following historical data, it is important to state that improvements anticancer treatments in recent years may have also reduced the incidence of SREs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of patients treated for metastatic breast cancer prior to the routine use of bisphosphonates, over 50 percent developed an SRE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoclast-inhibitors-for-patients-with-bone-metastases-from-breast-prostate-and-other-solid-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other evidence suggests that in the absence of osteoclast inhibition, one SRE occurs an average of every three to four months in women with lytic bone metastases from breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoclast-inhibitors-for-patients-with-bone-metastases-from-breast-prostate-and-other-solid-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from the untreated arms of older controlled trials of osteoclast inhibitors indicate that SREs have been most common in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer (two-year cumulative incidence 68 percent), followed by prostate cancer (two-year cumulative incidence 49 percent), and non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors (21-month cumulative incidence 48 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoclast-inhibitors-for-patients-with-bone-metastases-from-breast-prostate-and-other-solid-tumors/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In more recent phase III trials, approximately 24 percent of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) had an SRE within four to five months of being diagnosed with bone metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoclast-inhibitors-for-patients-with-bone-metastases-from-breast-prostate-and-other-solid-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another trial (CALGB 70604), approximately 26 percent of patients with metastatic breast cancer, prostate cancer, or multiple myeloma with at least one site of bone involvement had had an SRE prior to receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoclast-inhibitors-for-patients-with-bone-metastases-from-breast-prostate-and-other-solid-tumors/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition to osteoclast inhibition, management of patients with metastatic bone disease requires an integrated multidisciplinary management approach. The foundation of management entails antineoplastic treatment (eg, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted therapies, external beam radiation therapy, bone-targeted radiopharmaceuticals) and may also include surgery as required for existing or impending pathologic fractures. As treatment of these patients is palliative, supportive interventions, such as analgesics and concurrent subspecialty palliative care consultation and management, are essential.

Changes in treatment decisions are not based on biochemical changes, although these laboratory tests may influence when imaging may be repeated for some patients.</p><p>Tumor-induced osteolysis is associated with increased turnover of bone resorption markers such as urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx) and serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP). Bone biomarkers can provide additional information on prognosis and the likelihood of a skeletal-related event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoclast-inhibitors-for-patients-with-bone-metastases-from-breast-prostate-and-other-solid-tumors/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. However, the utility of bone biomarkers in monitoring therapy for patients receiving an osteoclast inhibitor is controversial, and at least in the United States, this is not yet considered a standard approach. The phase III BISMARK trial, described above, is exploring the benefits of marker-driven as compared with standard dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a>. Until more information is available, we suggest not routinely dosing bisphosphonates based upon markers of bone turnover.</p><p>We assess renal function, calcium, and electrolytes (or a biochemical profile) periodically throughout therapy. Vitamin D intake <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> levels can be assessed in the evaluation of calcium status.

Bone metastases cause pain, compromised quality of life, and skeletal-related events (SREs), which include pathologic fracture, the need for radiation or surgery to bone, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and spinal cord compression. Bisphosphonates and other osteoclast inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>, reduce the morbidity of metastatic bone disease, mainly by decreasing SREs. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the use of an osteoclast inhibitor to reduce the risk of skeletal complications for most patients with bone metastases from solid tumors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For patients in whom SREs are unlikely (eg, those with minimal bone tumour burden) and for those with a limited expected survival (eg, those with progressive liver metastases despite chemotherapy), treatment with osteoclast inhibitors should be considered on a case-by-case basis. The vast majority of the data for metastatic prostate cancer were generated in the castration-resistant state; hence, we advise that the use of osteoclast inhibitors be specifically applied to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with bone metastases. (See <a href=\"#H709665053\" class=\"local\">'Indications for osteoclast inhibitor therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H89621477\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and dosing considerations for individual agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom an osteoclast inhibitor is indicated, dental care should be optimized prior to treatment, preexisting hypocalcemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vitamin D deficiency should be corrected prior to treatment, and patients should be counseled regarding adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D during therapy, unless contraindicated. Renal function should be evaluated prior to dosing both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a>. (See <a href=\"#H709664748\" class=\"local\">'Considerations prior to initiating an osteoclast inhibitor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the prevention of SREs in most patients with bone metastases from breast cancer or CRPC, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> 4 mg every 12 weeks is our preferred osteoclast inhibitor regimen. However, some physicians may prefer every-four-week administration for patients with extensive or highly symptomatic bone metastases. (See <a href=\"#H26298336\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the approach to osteoclast inhibition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with bone metastases from other solid tumors, monthly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> 120 mg may be favored, although monthly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> 4 mg is a reasonable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H89623699\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H89625127\" class=\"local\">'Versus zoledronic acid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a bisphosphonate is chosen, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> over other bisphosphonates for patients with bone metastases from solid tumors (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Zoledronic acid has the greatest efficacy of the bisphosphonates shown to date, and it is approved for patients with bone metastases from a wide variety of solid tumors. Furthermore, a major advantage of zoledronic acid over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> is the shorter infusion time. (See <a href=\"#H709666266\" class=\"local\">'Zoledronic acid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> is not available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> is a reasonable alternative, at least for women with metastatic breast cancer. For patients who are at increased risk of renal toxicity and for those who prefer an oral regimen, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibandronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibandronate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clodronate-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clodronate</a> are reasonable, albeit slightly less effective, alternatives to intravenous zoledronic acid, where available, for management of bone metastases in metastatic breast cancer. (See <a href=\"#H709666584\" class=\"local\">'Other bisphosphonates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The approved schedule of administration for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> is 4 mg intravenously every three to four weeks, with the dose adjusted for creatinine clearance. However, for most patients with breast cancer or CRPC metastatic to bone who are not candidates for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> and who have neither highly symptomatic nor extensive bone metastases, we suggest administration of zoledronic acid every 12 weeks rather than every 4 weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We still prefer every-four-week dosing, at least temporarily, for patients with breast cancer or CRPC who have extensive or highly symptomatic bone metastases. Patients with bone metastases from breast cancer can switch to every-12-week dosing after nine or more months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are insufficient data to recommend a longer dosing interval in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors other than breast cancer or CRPC, and we continue to treat these patients with every-four-week <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a>. However, there may be circumstances (eg, no rapid bone resorption, limited burden of bone metastases, and high likelihood of response to systemic anticancer treatment) where an extended dosing interval might be appropriate for any solid tumor if it is compatible with the patient's goals of care. (See <a href=\"#H709666306\" class=\"local\">'Dosing interval'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom osteoclast inhibitor therapy is indicated, we suggest that treatment be continued indefinitely, particularly in the absence of excessive toxicity and as long as treatment is consistent with both the patient's and the clinician's joint treatment goals. (See <a href=\"#H709667185\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have experienced an SRE while on osteoclast-inhibiting therapy and receiving anticancer therapy, we suggest continuing osteoclast inhibition rather than discontinuing it (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H709667559\" class=\"local\">'Patients who develop an SRE while on therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1601827348\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Robert E Coleman, MD, FRCP, FRCPE, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteoclast-inhibitors-for-patients-with-bone-metastases-from-breast-prostate-and-other-solid-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">von Moos R, Sternberg C, Body JJ, Bokemeyer C.
