In a meta-analysis of cohort studies comparing the two procedures, POEM was slightly more effective than LHM in relieving dysphagia, but was associated with a higher incidence of pathologic reflux and a slightly longer hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-gastroenterology-and-hepatology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. After either procedure, over 90 percent of patients reported improvement in dysphagia at one year.

For detection of five cancer types for which no screening tests are available for high-risk patients (ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, and esophagus), sensitivity ranged from 69 to 98 percent, and specificity was above 99 percent.

The recommended age threshold for routine upper endoscopy in patients with dyspepsia, to exclude upper gastrointestinal neoplasia, has been raised to &ge;60 years, in contrast to earlier guidelines advising &ge;55 years. The new guidelines also recommend that patients &lt;60 years with dyspepsia be tested for <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> and treated if positive. For patients &lt;60 years, upper endoscopy is reserved for those with significant weight loss, overt gastrointestinal bleeding, more than one alarm feature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56585 \">table 1</a>), or rapid progression of one or more alarm features. The rationale for these revised recommendations is the low risk of gastric cancer in younger patients, the low positive predictive value of any single alarm feature in detecting gastrointestinal neoplasia, and the inherent risk and cost of performing upper endoscopy. Our management approach is generally consistent with these guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F115195\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115195 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Hemodialysis is frequently difficult to perform because of hemodynamic instability, and outcomes are dismal in patients who are not listed for liver transplant. In a retrospective cohort study, mortality at six months was 84 percent (median survival, 21 days) among patients not listed for transplant who developed hepatorenal syndrome and initiated dialysis; recovery of kidney function sufficient to stop dialysis occurred in 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-gastroenterology-and-hepatology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Available nonadjuvanted recombinant vaccines are effective and extremely safe, although they require three doses and 5 to 10 percent of patients do not respond. In November 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration granted conditional approval of a new adjuvanted vaccine (HEPLISAV-B) for adults 18 years and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-gastroenterology-and-hepatology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This vaccine, given in two doses, appears more immunogenic than the nonadjuvanted vaccines and is generally well tolerated. However, there are ongoing safety concerns regarding a potentially increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and immune-mediated disorders, which will be further evaluated in a phase 4 study. The optimal use of this vaccine is thus still to be determined.

Infected necrosis requires debridement, which traditionally has been performed with open surgery. Now, a Dutch multicenter randomized trial has evaluated two minimally invasive approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-gastroenterology-and-hepatology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Compared with percutaneous catheter drainage followed by video-assisted retroperitoneal debridement, endoscopic catheter drainage followed by endoscopic necrosectomy resulted in lower rates of cardiovascular organ failure and pancreatic fistula, and a shorter hospital stay, but similar mortality and major morbidity rates. About half of the patients in each group responded to catheter drainage alone without debridement. We believe that the optimal approach to management of infected pancreatic necrosis should be determined by disease and patient characteristics, and that these patients should be treated at a tertiary center where all options are likely to be available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-debridement#H263623\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic debridement&quot;, section on 'Minimally invasive approach to pancreatic debridement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114949\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial pancreaticoduodenectomy versus duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection for chronic pancreatitis (September 2017)</span></p><p>Head-dominant chronic pancreatitis can be treated surgically with either partial pancreaticoduodenectomy or duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection (DPPHR). In a multicenter randomized trial (ChroPac), the two procedures resulted in similar quality of life at 24 months with no significant differences in major morbidity and mortality rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-gastroenterology-and-hepatology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. DPPHR resulted in shorter operative time (4.7 versus 5.3 hours), but more readmissions due to chronic pancreatitis (27 versus 11 percent). Given that both procedures are equally effective and morbid, surgeons should choose based on their experience and the patient's anatomical and clinical conditions.

In a study of over 65,000 patients with a first episode of diverticulitis managed without colectomy, only 11.2 percent required readmission for recurrent diverticulitis in the next four years and only 0.9 and 0.75 percent required emergency and elective colon resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-gastroenterology-and-hepatology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These rates do not justify colon surgery for most patients. Following an initial episode of acute diverticulitis, we recommend surgery for patients who have had complications from diverticulitis (eg, abscess, obstruction, fistulization) or who are immunocompromised, as subsequent attacks in such patients are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. We suggest not performing surgery routinely in other individuals.

At 12 weeks, 96 percent in both groups were free of CDI recurrence. Fecal microbial diversity rates increased and were maintained for up to 12 weeks following FMT in both groups.

Gastrointestinal symptom rating scores and bloating were higher with fructan than with gluten. There was no difference in symptom scores between gluten and placebo groups.
