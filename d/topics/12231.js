In patients in whom there is direct damage to bone vasculature (eg, femoral neck fracture) or direct injury of bone or marrow elements (eg, radiation injury, dysbarism, or caisson disease), the cause is clearly identifiable. However, in many patients, the mechanisms by which this disorder develops are not fully understood.</p><p>Compromise of the bone vasculature, leading to the death of bone and marrow cells (bone marrow infarction), and ultimate mechanical failure appear to be common to most proposed etiologies. The process is most often progressive, resulting in joint destruction within a few months to two years in the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18899891\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact prevalence of osteonecrosis is unknown. In the United States, there are an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 patients newly diagnosed each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], with even larger numbers worldwide, and it is the underlying diagnosis in approximately 10 percent of all total hip replacements (THR) in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The male-to-female ratio varies depending upon the associated comorbidities. For example, alcohol-associated osteonecrosis is more common in men, while osteonecrosis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is more common in women. The mean age at diagnosis also depends upon comorbidities, but is typically less than 50 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of traumatic and atraumatic factors contribute to the etiology of osteonecrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69502 \">table 1</a>). A definitive etiologic role has been established for some of these factors, based upon longitudinal cohort studies or meta-analyses, but not for the majority, which are considered associated risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Use of glucocorticoids and excessive alcohol intake are associated with more than 80 percent of atraumatic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of osteonecrosis is an area of controversy. Most experts believe that it is the result of the combined effects of genetic predisposition, metabolic factors, and local factors affecting blood supply, such as vascular damage, increased intraosseous pressure, and mechanical stresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]. The early stages of the natural history are unclear, as these stages are largely asymptomatic and the patient does not present until later. It is generally agreed that there is an interruption of the blood circulation within the bone; subsequently, the adjacent area becomes hyperemic, resulting in demineralization, in trabecular thinning, and, later, in collapse.</p><p>The histopathologic finding of bone marrow infarction has been noted in marrow samples from patients with some of the same disorders that cause clinically apparent osteonecrosis, but neoplastic disorders, particularly hematologic and lymphoid malignancies and metastatic cancer with associated coagulopathy, are other potential etiologies. The causes of bone marrow infarction (bone marrow necrosis) are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-bone-marrow-aspirate-smears#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of bone marrow aspirate smears&quot;, section on 'Bone marrow necrosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous studies relate the use of glucocorticoids to the development of osteonecrosis. In one study of 1199 joints in 302 patients, the incidence of developing osteonecrosis as a consequence of these medications ranged from 21 to 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; the frequency varies, depending, in part, upon the associated comorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Although the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis is unknown, there are several mechanisms that have been proposed. One possible mechanism of glucocorticoid-associated osteonecrosis involves alterations in circulating lipids with resultant microemboli in the arteries supplying bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Another is that an increase in bone marrow adipocyte size and number within the bone marrow compartment of convex joints contributes to blocking venous outflow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another theory proposed that glucocorticoids induce changes in venous endothelial cells, leading to stasis, increased intraosseous pressure, and eventual necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Patients treated with prolonged high doses of glucocorticoids appear to be at the greatest risk of developing osteonecrosis; however, these patients often have multiple other risk factors. Even patients receiving chronic physiologic glucocorticoid replacement for adrenal insufficiency may develop osteonecrosis (2.4 percent in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, osteonecrosis generally does not result from short-term use of these medications. In previous anecdotal reports suggesting an association, multiple additional risk factors were also present, suggesting that it was highly unlikely that these low doses lead to the disease.</p><p>Most studies have found that the risk is low (less than 3 percent) in patients treated with doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> less than 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. A population-based study identified 98,390 patients who had received a single short-term, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> taper pack (MTP) prescription and found that the incidence of osteonecrosis among this group of patients was only 0.13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, compared with patients who had not received an MTP, the relative risk was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-1.84). In a small series of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients exposed to higher doses of glucocorticoids, the prednisone dose in the highest month of therapy exceeded 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in 93 percent and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in 100 percent of patients with osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The only clinical finding that distinguished patients with osteonecrosis from those without this complication was a Cushingoid appearance (86 versus 15 percent).</p><p>It has been suggested that the initial glucocorticoid dose may be more important than the total dose or duration of therapy. One report, for example, evaluated 17 patients with SLE who developed osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The glucocorticoid dose during the initial period of therapy was compared with that of 25 control patients with SLE. The patients with osteonecrosis had received a substantially higher dose of glucocorticoid in the first one, three, and six months of therapy. By comparison, the duration of therapy did not correlate with osteonecrosis, and total glucocorticoid exposure was virtually identical in both groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excessive alcohol use and the development of osteonecrosis have long been linked; fat emboli, adipocyte hypertrophy, venous stasis, and increased cortisol levels have all been implicated as etiologic factors. While only a small percentage of alcoholics develop osteonecrosis, alcohol has been considered an associated risk factor in up to 31 percent of the osteonecrosis patients evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. One epidemiologic study compared 112 patients who had idiopathic osteonecrosis of the femoral head and no history of systemic corticosteroid use with 168 hospital controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. An elevated risk for regular drinkers and a clear dose-response relationship were noted; the relative risks were 3.3, 9.8, and 17.9 for current consumers of less than 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/week,</span> 400 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/week,</span> and more than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/week</span> of alcohol, respectively, compared with controls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic lupus erythematosus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteonecrosis has been reported in 3 to 30 percent of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>]. This wide range reflects the use of different techniques in defining this disorder (from the less sensitive plain film radiograph to the quite sensitive magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), variations in corticosteroid dosing, and different durations of follow-up. One report followed 228 patients with SLE for a mean period of 31 months. Nine percent had osteonecrosis, and it was estimated that the frequency would rise to 30 percent at 10 to 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Patients with SLE who have taken glucocorticoids are at greatest risk, although occasional cases have been noted in the absence of this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/17,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,22</a>]. Osteonecrosis often develops in patients with SLE a relatively short time after the onset of corticosteroid therapy. One prospective study, for example, evaluated 60 patients with SLE over a period of five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Those who had no MRI abnormalities in the femoral head during the first year of follow-up were unlikely to develop osteonecrosis at a later date.</p><p>Other risk factors for osteonecrosis have also been identified in SLE. These include regular doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> greater than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> evidence of corticosteroid-associated end organ effect, Raynaud phenomenon, and hyperlipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There are conflicting data on the role of antiphospholipid antibodies in lupus; some data support an association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], while other data do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Additional associations have been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], including African-American origin, Cushingoid habitus, vasculitis, pleuritis, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiphospholipid antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to their potential role in patients with SLE, antiphospholipid antibodies may be associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis in other individuals. This was illustrated in a study of 45 patients who had osteonecrosis, only nine of whom had SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies was more than threefold greater among 45 patients with osteonecrosis compared with 40 healthy controls (34 versus 10 percent). In a study of multifocal osteonecrosis patients, antiphospholipid antibody positivity was detected in 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, as with patients with SLE, not all data regarding the risk of osteonecrosis in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome are concordant, suggesting, at best, a weak association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fracture or dislocation may cause damage to the extraosseous blood vessels supplying the affected region. Fractures in the subcapital region of the femoral neck, for example, frequently interrupt the major part of the blood supply to the head of the femur, which can result in ischemia and in bone necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a meta-analysis including 1558 femoral neck fractures in patients 60 years or younger, the pooled incidence of osteonecrosis was 14.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. At the wrist, fractures of the scaphoid and lunate are also associated with an increased risk of osteonecrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sickle cell hemoglobinopathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteonecrosis is common in patients with homozygous sickle cell disease due to various mechanisms including red blood cell sickling and to bone marrow hyperplasia. Approximately 50 percent of affected patients develop osteonecrosis by the age of 35 years.

Symptomatic osteonecrosis can develop years after the exposure; the number of exposures and the magnitude of depth and of pressure are important risk factors. Elevated plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) may also increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2676760180\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute lymphoblastic leukemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteonecrosis is one of the most common adverse effects of anti-leukemic treatment among children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In a study of 10,729 new-onset acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients (age range, 2.02 to 21.23 years), 242 (2.3 percent) developed osteonecrosis within five years of their ALL diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although the rate of osteonecrosis was found to be lower in a large database study in Finland and Denmark (0.4 percent), there was also an association reported for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (4.5 percent) and acute myeloid leukemia (2.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

A prospective study of 48 patients without evidence of femoral osteonecrosis prior to renal transplantation noted an incidence of 4 percent when examined by MRI at six months following the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

As an example, one study surveyed the prevalence of osteonecrosis among 207 patients undergoing HCT for lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]; patients receiving allogeneic HCT were more often affected than those receiving autologous HCT (10 versus 2 percent). The duration and cumulative dose of glucocorticoids, as well as the presence of graft-versus-host disease, were risk factors for the development of this complication.</p><p>Among allogeneic HCT recipients, the risk of osteonecrosis may also be dependent upon the sex of the donor and the recipient, as well as the disease for which HCT is being performed. This was illustrated in a study of 255 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT for one of a variety of hematologic disorders and who were evaluated for osteonecrosis of the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Substitution of serine for glycine in a portion of the molecule that forms an extended triple helical portion was predicted to result from the observed mutations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The same COL2A1 mutation described above can be associated with at least three different clinical presentations. This was observed in another Chinese family that included individuals with premature osteoarthritis, osteonecrosis of the femoral head, or Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease, which were diagnosed, respectively, in young adults, adolescents, or children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Many patients have bilateral involvement at the time of diagnosis, including disease of the hips, knees, and shoulders. In patients who present with osteonecrosis of the knee, shoulder, or other non-hip joint, the hip should be evaluated clinically and by imaging.

The pathognomonic crescent sign (subchondral radiolucency) is evidence of subchondral collapse. Later stages reveal loss of sphericity or collapse of the femoral head. Ultimately, joint-space narrowing and degenerative changes in the acetabulum are visible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Radionuclide bone scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technetium-99m bone scanning has been used for patients with suspected disease who have negative radiographs, unilateral symptoms, and no risk factors.

However, bone scanning, performed in 48 patients with suspected osteonecrosis of the shoulder, hip, knee, or ankle, was less sensitive than MRI (56 versus 100 percent) in diagnosing histologically-confirmed osteonecrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

However, there must be some caution in interpreting MRI findings, particularly in asymptomatic patients. One study, for example, evaluated 23 corticosteroid-treated patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who had no hip pain and a negative hip plain radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Over a three-year period, only two of the eight patients with an initially abnormal MRI developed a lesion detectable by conventional hip radiographs. Thus, surgical treatment based upon abnormal MRI findings alone, in the absence of symptoms, can potentially result in overtreatment of some patients. However, treatment is never based solely upon an imaging study. Size of the lesion, location of the lesion, age of the patient, general health, and symptoms, if present, also influence treatment decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>The amount of femoral head involvement estimated by MRI may be indicative of the likelihood of subsequent collapse. As an example, in a study of 37 hips with early osteonecrosis, the sum of the angles subtended by involved bone (measured from near the center of the femoral head in the sagittal and coronal views) correlated with subsequent subchondral collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Among those hips with a sum of &le;190 degrees, none collapsed during up to five years of follow-up.

In the latter situation, chronic pain and transient osteopenia are features of the complex regional pain syndrome (also known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, causalgia, and other terms).

An effusion may be present. The absence of fever, leukocytosis, or elevation of acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C-reactive protein [CRP]) is characteristic of both osteonecrosis and BMES and helps to exclude an infectious etiology.

Linear regions of low signal on both T1- and T2-weighted MRI in the subchondral area that parallel the articular surface are characteristic of these rare fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].

Newer imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the need for quantification of involvement have led to these revisions.

The goal of therapy is to preserve the native joint for as long as possible.

Nonoperative treatment includes bed rest, partial weightbearing with crutches, weightbearing as tolerated, and the use of analgesics as well as other pharmacologic agents. Reports suggest that nonoperative treatment alone provides adequate clinical results in only approximately 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26112121\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacologic agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Various pharmacologic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head, including bisphosphonates, statins, anticoagulants, and vasodilators. Although some of the findings are promising, additional studies are needed to establish the efficacy of these individual agents before routine use is recommended.</p><p>The rationale for use of these agents is based upon the purported pathophysiology or possible cause of osteonecrosis in a particular patient. As an example, a patient with osteonecrosis in the setting of coagulation disorders may benefit from anticoagulation. In addition, it is generally thought that these agents are only likely to be efficacious for small lesions and for pre-collapse disease, prior to any degree of biomechanical compromise. The following is a brief summary of these pharmacologic agents:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bisphosphonates &ndash; Slowing bone resorption of necrotic bone with bisphosphonates may be beneficial in the treatment of osteonecrosis of the major joints, but the evidence is mixed.

After a mean follow-up of four years, only 31 hips required total hip arthroplasty (THA). There was also an improvement in pain and clinical function, as well as a reduction in the rate of femoral head collapse. However, this improvement did not appear to last in those followed for eight years.</p><p>A beneficial effect of bisphosphonates was also noted in a study that randomly assigned 40 patients (54 affected hips) who had stage II or III osteonecrosis (ON) (University of Pennsylvania classification system) involving &ge;30 percent of the femoral head to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> (70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> for 25 weeks) or nonoperative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In this controlled, but unblinded study, the proportion of hips that developed collapse was significantly smaller for those who received alendronate compared with controls (2 of 29 [7 percent] versus 19 of 25 [76 percent], respectively).</p><p>By contrast, a two-year randomized trial in which patients with osteonecrosis received either oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> or placebo did not find a significant difference in the outcomes between these two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Twenty-one of 32 of the patients receiving bisphosphonates progressed radiologically, with four patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR). This was similar to the results of the placebo group with progression noted in 21 of 32 patients and with five patients undergoing THR. Another trial found that there was no difference in outcomes between patients with osteonecrosis of the hip receiving extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) alone compared with those receiving ESWT plus bisphosphonate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In a meta-analysis including five eligible trials and 329 patients, it was noted that bisphosphonate therapy did not significantly reduce the progression to collapse and that there was notable heterogeneity between trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasodilators &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Iloprost</a>, a prostacyclin analog, is thought to decrease intraosseous hypertension and increase blood flow to the ischemic area of the osteonecrotic lesion.

One study evaluated 60 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) requiring high-dose glucocorticoid treatment, and assigned about half of the patients to anticoagulation with warfarin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Although the differences were not statistically significant, fewer patients in the warfarin group developed osteonecrosis compared with the control group (21 versus 33 percent, respectively). Another prospective study evaluated the effectiveness of enoxaparin in 35 patients with early stages of osteonecrosis with a thrombophilic disorder compared with historic controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

ESWT is thought to promote bone healing through the stimulation of neovascularization. In one study, the effects of ESWT were compared with core decompression and bone grafting for patients with osteonecrosis of the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Patients receiving ESWT demonstrated improved pain and function scores at two-year follow-up, with fewer hips eventually requiring THA (three versus nine). It has been suggested that ESWT is more effective for early-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>Pulsed electromagnetic fields may stimulate osteogenesis as its mechanism and has been efficacious in some studies. One study found that at a mean follow-up of over two years, 94 percent of the patients with early osteonecrosis of the hip avoided surgery with the use of pulsed electromagnetic device, while 25 percent of patients with more advanced osteonecrosis progressed radiographically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>Hyperbaric oxygen may improve osteonecrosis by increasing oxygen early in the ischemic case, but the evidence is mixed. One study evaluated hyperbaric oxygen use compared with compressed air on pain and radiographic outcomes in early osteonecrotic lesions of the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Patients who received hyperbaric oxygen had a significantly lower pain score compared with controls. After seven years, all patients demonstrated lesion improvement on MRI and none required THA. In another study including 54 patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (58 joints), 93 percent of joints survived after a mean follow-up of 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint-preserving procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The failure of nonoperative management and initial relatively poor long-term survival of prosthetic devices created the need for other interventions aimed at preserving the femoral head and at slowing or halting the progression of osteonecrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h3\">Core decompression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Core decompression was initially used as a diagnostic tool to measure bone marrow pressure and to obtain biopsy specimens. It became a mode of therapy when it was noted that patients had pain relief following the procedure.</p><p>Numerous small case series and retrospective studies looking at core decompression have been reported; few randomized controlled trials have been performed. In one prospective randomized trial that compared core decompression with nonoperative treatment of 55 hips in 36 patients with osteonecrosis, success (as judged by the Harris Hip Score) was achieved in 7 of 10 surgically treated Ficat stage I hips compared with one of five nonoperatively treated hips at this stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Success was also higher with surgery in stage II hips (five of seven versus zero of seven) and in stage III hips (8 of 11 versus 1 of 10). Stage 0 and IV groups were too small to analyze differences. Less successful results were seen if roentgenographic criteria of success were used.</p><p>A second randomized trial of 37 hips in 33 patients randomized to core decompression or to nonoperative treatment found that pain relief was significantly better after a minimum two-year follow-up in the core decompression group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].

With a minimum follow-up of five years, survivorship of the graft for stage II, III, IV, and V hips (Marcus and Enneking classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]) was 89, 77, 71, and 73 percent, respectively. A subsequent study found that, of Ficat stage II and III hips followed for at least 10 years, only 13 of 76 (17 percent) were converted to THA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2509439\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonvascularized bone grafting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonvascularized bone grafting has also been used in numerous studies with variable success rates. Light-bulb procedures have subsequently shown greater efficacy, although there is still a lack of prospective randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/101-103\" class=\"abstract_t\">101-103</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h3\">Cell-based therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has also been increasing and considerable interest in the use of cell-based therapy for the treatment of osteonecrosis. This was popularized in Europe with reports of improved survivorship when compared with core decompression alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/104-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">104-106</a>]. Both autologous and allogenous sources of bone marrow cells are being investigated. The outcomes of these small series have been inconclusive, and larger, scientifically rigorous randomized trials are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteotomy has also been used as a joint-sparing technique to treat osteonecrosis. The goal of this procedure is to move the area of necrosis away from the major load-transmitting area of the acetabulum and to redistribute the weightbearing forces to articular cartilage, which is supported by healthy bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There are a variety of techniques by which this may be accomplished, several of which are technically demanding.</p><p>Results of clinical trials utilizing osteotomy vary; the best outcomes have been reported in the Japanese literature. In one report, intertrochanteric osteotomy was performed in 128 hips of 90 patients who were then followed for two to nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Excellent results were obtained clinically and radiographically in 98 hips; the success rate was 90 percent in stage I or II hips. Progressive collapse in the newly created weightbearing area occurred in 25 hips in which the lesions had been extensive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42\"><span class=\"h3\">Decompression versus osteotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Core decompression and osteotomy may have similar efficacy in early disease, but intertrochanteric osteotomy may be preferred for patients who have progressed to collapse of the femoral head by the time of diagnosis. This was illustrated in a study of the two techniques in a cohort of 177 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Core decompressions were performed on 94 patients, and intertrochanteric osteotomies were performed on 83. Failure of the initial procedure, as indicated by the need for any further hip surgery, occurred in similar proportions of those with early (pre-collapse) disease (26 versus 22 percent). By contrast, failure was more likely following core decompression in those with more advanced disease; for those with collapse of the femoral head at the time of initial surgery, the failure rates were 44 percent with core decompression versus 24 percent with osteotomy. These findings are biologically plausible since core decompression would not be expected to be as effective once collapse had occurred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h2\">Total joint replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The results of THR for the treatment of osteonecrosis are improving. Most older studies suggested a worse prognosis for patients with osteonecrosis than for other disorders, with failures being three to four times more common. A retrospective review conducted in 1989, for example, compared THR of 29 hips in 23 patients with osteonecrosis with the same procedure in 63 hips affected by osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. The revision rate was much higher in the osteonecrosis group (28 versus 6 percent), and the time to revision was an average of five years less in these patients. On the other hand, hip scores following surgery were significantly better in the osteoarthritis group. These findings were in contrast to the findings in other studies of no significant differences between the outcomes for these two patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].</p><p>In a 2011 systematic review of THR for osteonecrosis, the revision rates were found to have decreased from 17 percent when operations occurred before 1990 to 3 percent when operations occurred in 1990 or later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Further studies of THR using uncemented and cemented femoral components have indicated excellent long-term results for patients with osteonecrosis that are comparable to results for patients with osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/114-116\" class=\"abstract_t\">114-116</a>]. The primary cause for re-revision surgery is loss of fixation of the acetabular component secondary to wear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].</p><p>Total knee arthroplasty is an option in patients who have osteonecrosis affecting this joint. Similar to that of THA, the success rate may be lower in patients who have osteonecrosis than in those who receive joint replacement for other reasons. Several studies have demonstrated excellent outcomes in this patient population. A 2006 systematic review noted that the results for patients after 1985 were significantly improved compared with patients prior to 1985, including a revision rate of 3 versus 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p>Total joint arthroplasty may also be utilized for osteonecrosis of the shoulder.

Analyzing the existing data regarding therapy is difficult since most studies are small and retrospective. There are few prospective studies, and, given the progressive nature of the process, untreated controls are not possible. In addition to the size of the studies, differences in staging schemes, proposed associated risk factors of enrolled patients, and quantification of clinical and radiographic responses are not standardized.

Compromise of the bone vasculature, leading to the death of bone and marrow cells (bone marrow infarction), and ultimate mechanical failure appear to be the common etiologies shared by the varied proposed causes. The mean age at diagnosis is less than 40 years. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18899891\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients treated with prolonged high doses of glucocorticoids appear to be at substantial risk of developing osteonecrosis; however, these patients often have multiple other risk factors, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Systemic lupus erythematosus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early diagnosis of osteonecrosis may provide the opportunity to prevent collapse and the need for joint replacement. However, most patients present late in the course of the disease, and a high index of suspicion is necessary for those with risk factors, particularly high-dose corticosteroid use. The most common presenting symptom of osteonecrosis is pain, although a small proportion of patients are asymptomatic. Physical findings are largely nonspecific. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Pain'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The features of osteonecrosis seen on imaging studies are helpful diagnostically and provide the basis for classification and staging systems. Evaluation for suspected osteonecrosis of the femoral head should begin with anterior-posterior and frog-leg lateral films. The plain radiograph can remain normal for months after symptom onset. The earliest findings are mild density changes, followed by sclerosis and cysts; the pathognomonic crescent sign (subchondral radiolucency) from subchondral collapse; and subsequent loss of sphericity or collapse of the femoral head with eventual joint-space narrowing and degenerative changes in the acetabulum that are visible. Radionuclide bone scanning has moderate sensitivity but is nonspecific. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Plain film radiography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Radionuclide bone scanning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is far more sensitive than plain radiographs or radionuclide bone scanning and is preferred for diagnostic use in patients with nondiagnostic plain radiography. MRI changes include well-demarcated and inhomogeneous focal lesions on T1-weighted images with a single-density line separating normal and ischemic bone, as well as a second high-intensity line on T2-weighted images (the pathognomonic double-line sign) representing hypervascular granulation tissue. However, for end-stage disease, MRIs may be unnecessary.

However, radiological systems are the most frequently used in the diagnosis, staging, and management of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Classification systems and staging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic staging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Clinical staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal management approach for osteonecrosis remains uncertain and controversial. The goal of therapy is to preserve the native joint for as long as possible. The three main therapeutic options include nonoperative management, joint-preserving procedures, and joint replacement. Factors influencing the choice of therapy include the presence (or absence) of symptoms, the degree of involvement, the stage of the lesion, and the comorbidities.
