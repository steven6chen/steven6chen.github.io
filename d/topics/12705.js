A major depressive episode is a period lasting at least two weeks, with five or more of the following symptoms: depressed mood, anhedonia, insomnia or hypersomnia, change in appetite or weight, psychomotor retardation or agitation, low energy, poor concentration, thoughts of worthlessness or guilt, and recurrent thoughts about death or suicide. In addition, the symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning, and the syndrome is not due to the physiologic effects of a substance (eg, drug abuse or medications) or another medical condition (eg, hypothyroidism).

Patients with mild to moderate depression can generally be treated in an outpatient or partial (day) hospital program setting. </p><p>Severe unipolar major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms that occur nearly every day, as indicated by a score &ge;20 points on the PHQ-9. Severely ill patients often report suicidal ideation and behavior, typically demonstrate obvious impairment of functioning, are more likely to develop complications such as psychotic features, and are typically referred to a psychiatrist for management and inpatient hospitalization. </p><p>In addition, the PHQ-9 classifies patients as moderately severe if their score is 15 to 19. Patients with moderately severe major depression require urgent attention and often require treatment in either a partial hospital program or on an inpatient unit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590049968\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administering psychotherapy to children and adolescents in targeted populations can prevent onset of depressive disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-and-treatment-for-pediatric-depression/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the benefits are small and do not appear to last beyond one year. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2918886563\"><span class=\"h2\">Targeted (selected) populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Targeted treatment with psychotherapy to prevent either new or recurrent onset of depressive syndromes includes children and adolescents who are at high risk for the disorder by virtue of factors that include subsyndromal depressive symptoms, death of a parent, family conflict, or family history of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-and-treatment-for-pediatric-depression/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. We generally do not administer psychotherapy to prevent depressive disorders in at-risk youth, unless the individual has suicidal ideation or behavior, a comorbid psychiatric disorder, functional impairment, has previously had a depressive syndrome, or requests treatment. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to provide psychotherapy even in the absence of these five exceptions, or to monitor at-risk youth regularly (eg, once per month). (See <a href=\"#H259599919\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Evidence regarding the use of psychotherapy to prevent depressive disorders includes a systematic review that performed a meta-analysis of 22 randomized trials, which compared psychotherapy with control conditions in children and adolescents (n &gt;3900) who did not meet criteria for a depression diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-and-treatment-for-pediatric-depression/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The youth were at risk for developing depressive syndromes due to the presence of subthreshold, mild to moderate depressive symptoms. Active treatment consisted of cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy, and control conditions consisted of usual care or no treatment. Most of the trials were conducted in school settings and delivered either group or individual therapy, usually on a weekly basis for 8 to 12 sessions. Diagnosis of a depressive disorder for up to 12 months after randomization was less likely with psychotherapy than control conditions; however, the clinical effect was small and did not persist beyond one year, and none of the trials controlled for psychotherapy&rsquo;s nonspecific effects, such as attention. </p><p>In addition, the systematic review performed a second meta-analysis, which aggregated four trials (n &gt;400 at-risk youth) that were not included in the first meta-analysis, and compared psychotherapy with control conditions consisting of an attention placebo (eg, psychoeducation about general mental <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical health) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-and-treatment-for-pediatric-depression/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Universal prevention involves administering psychotherapy to the population regardless of risk for the disorder, and is not effective. In a meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials that compared either cognitive behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy with control conditions in children and adolescents (n &gt;2000), the incidence of depressive disorders was comparable for the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-and-treatment-for-pediatric-depression/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86780457\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF TREATING YOUTH WITH MAJOR DEPRESSION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86780505\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient safety and treatment setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in acute phase treatment addresses potential safety concerns. Every depressed child and adolescent must be evaluated for suicide risk and if risk is identified, safety must be assured by choosing the right setting.

Treatment should be provided in the least restrictive setting that is safe and effective for a given patient. The setting depends upon the severity of illness (including safety status), level of parental support, and motivation for treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86780511\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment plan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment planning should be collaborative with patients and their families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-and-treatment-for-pediatric-depression/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; successful treatment typically requires parental involvement and cooperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-and-treatment-for-pediatric-depression/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Clinicians (eg, pediatricians, psychiatrists, or psychologists) who are treating youth with major depression and are formulating a treatment plan should engage the parents to weigh the risks and benefits of the various interventions (eg, psychotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pharmacotherapy) in deciding upon a treatment regimen. Involving the school may also helpful, depending upon the severity of symptoms and impairment in the school setting.</p><p>The plan specifies the choice of therapy and frequency of sessions based upon the severity of depressive symptoms, the age and developmental status of the patient, the degree of current exposure to negative life events, and comorbidity (eg, anxiety and substance use disorders) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-and-treatment-for-pediatric-depression/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Many guidelines suggest a minimum of eight weeks of treatment for an acute episode of major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-and-treatment-for-pediatric-depression/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Multiple sessions per week may be needed during the acute treatment phase. In addition, the plan should include interventions directed at problems in the patient&rsquo;s environment. </p><p>The plan also addresses the use of medication.

With education, nonadherence with treatment may decrease, and patients and family members may view depression as an illness, which can reduce feelings of stigmatization and provide relief. Psychosocial difficulties may then be easier to address. Education may also help family members identify their own depressive symptoms and need for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-prevention-and-treatment-for-pediatric-depression/abstract/10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,14</a>]. </p><p>Education addresses the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs and symptoms of depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 1</a>), using language that is developmentally appropriate for the patient's level of understanding.

Patients are treated by a team that usually includes a primary care clinician, a case manager who provides support and outreach to patients, and a mental health specialist (eg, psychiatrist) who provides consultation and supervision. Other elements include a structured treatment plan that involves pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or both; scheduled follow-up visits; communication amongst the members of the treatment team; and measurement-based care. Collaborative care is used for treating pediatric patients with mild to moderate episodes of unipolar major depression, as well as severe episodes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment resistant episodes, and is used for patients managed by pediatricians or family medicine clinicians who lack experience with major depression. Instituting collaborative care to integrate the general medical and mental health of patients is endorsed by the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

For child and adolescent patients with moderate to severe unipolar major depression who fail initial treatment with antidepressant monotherapy, we suggest switching antidepressants and adding CBT, rather than switching antidepressants alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
