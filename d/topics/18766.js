Some of the disorders causing these lesions are limited to the vulva, while others also involve skin or mucocutaneous membranes elsewhere on the body. This topic provides a morphology-based classification system that can help clinicians with the differential diagnosis of these lesions after performing a history and physical examination. This classification system is also useful for guiding the choice of diagnostic tests and procedures.</p><p>The pertinent history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests and procedures used to evaluate women with vulvar lesions are described separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lesions-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lesions: Diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>). Treatment is also discussed separately in topic reviews on these disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27976821\"><span class=\"h1\">MORPHOLOGIC DEFINITIONS FOR MUCOCUTANEOUS VULVAR LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucocutaneous vulvar lesions can be classified using the morphologic definitions described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95851 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H608948757\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO USE THIS TOPIC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After history, physical examination, and morphologic classification (see tables), the information in this topic can be used to begin differential diagnosis of the lesion. Diagnostic entities are listed for each morphologic classification and often listed under more than one morphologic classification since many lesions have more than one presentation (morphologic type, color). The complete description of the diagnostic entity is provided only once; for morphological variants, the entity is noted and linked to its descriptive section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27977849\"><span class=\"h1\">RED PATCHES AND PLAQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95964\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95964 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27976833\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidiasis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination &ndash; Bright red, sometimes eroded patches and plaques involving varying portions of the vulva may be noted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51710\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51710 \">picture 1</a>). In severe cases, the perianal area and the upper inner thighs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95804\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95804 \">picture 2</a>) may also be involved. A slight scale may overlie the red patches and plaques. Small 1 to 2 mm pustules often stud the surface of these patches and plaques, and, at the periphery of the main area of involvement, similar satellite red, yellow, or white papules <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pustules may occur. The pustules break easily, leaving small erosions with peripheral (&quot;collarette&quot;) scales. If many pustules are present, the desquamating scale can be prominent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70637\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70637 \">picture 3</a>). Occasionally, when intertriginous folds are involved, linear fissures may occur within the crease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vaginal discharge due to vaginal candidiasis is usually, but not always, present. Sometimes, white plaques made up of a mat of candidal mycelia can be found loosely attached to the mucous membranes of the vagina <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vulvar vestibule.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms &ndash; The lesions may be pruritic or painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis &ndash; The diagnosis is based on characteristic history, physical examination, and a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation to detect fungal elements (mycelia and spores) in vulvar skin scrapings or on a smear of discharge. Vaginal candidiasis supports the diagnosis. <em>Candida</em> culture for diagnostic uncertainty and speciation should be obtained in cases of poor response to therapy or chronic recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A molecular-based test using vaginal swabs collected by clinicians or patients can also be considered for the diagnosis most common fungal as well as bacterial and protozoan causes of vaginitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Weeping and crusting may be seen. Scale is usually present with atopic dermatitis, but, when the vulva is involved, the scale is often obscured because moisture may whiten the surface of the patches and plaques.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms &ndash; The predominant symptom is severe pruritus. Incessant scratching leads to more itching and more scratching, which is termed the &quot;itch-scratch cycle.&quot; Development of numerous or deep excoriations may be associated with pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis &ndash; A diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is usually based on the clinical findings; rarely, patch testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsy is necessary to identify an <span class=\"nowrap\">allergen/irritant</span> or exclude an underlying dermatosis. A history of atopy (hay fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asthma) is present in approximately 70 percent of patients and supports the clinical diagnosis. Atopic dermatitis is an important component of the differential diagnosis in these women, as it is often overlooked and treatment is delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-dermatitis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar dermatitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27976845\"><span class=\"h2\">Lichen simplex chronicus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lichen simplex chronicus is a chronic, endogenous eczema. It is a common cause of vulvar pruritus that often manifests with nightly itching, which may result in an itch-scratch-itch cycle that can be uncontrollable. It is frequently seen in health care providers&rsquo; offices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination &ndash; Similar to atopic dermatitis (see <a href=\"#H27976839\" class=\"local\">'Atopic dermatitis (eczema)'</a> above) except the plaques may be a deeper red or a red-brown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69453\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69453 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68426\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68426 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81018\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81018 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59195\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59195 \">picture 7</a>). In some circumstances, such as after partial treatment, inflammation is not clinically visible, so the plaques may be skin colored. Lichenification due to chronic rubbing usually predominates, although some degree of erosion due to excoriation is regularly present. Excoriation can result in ulcers. Scale is present, but surface roughness may be absent because it is compacted, and it may be obscured because of whitening from chronic moisture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When the thickened, red epidermis is moist from sweat, urine, or vaginal secretions, it whitens. This phenomenon is similar to the whitening seen over the volar fingertips after swimming for a prolonged period of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms &ndash; The same &quot;itch-scratch cycle&quot; as occurs in atopic dermatitis leads to vigorous scratching and rubbing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis &ndash; A diagnosis of lichen simplex chronicus is based on the clinical findings. Rarely, biopsy will be needed. A history of atopy (hay fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asthma) may be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27976851\"><span class=\"h2\">Psoriasis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination &ndash; One or more sharply marginated, scaling, red plaques predominantly involving the labia majora (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56110\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56110 \">picture 8</a>). In most instances, more typical psoriatic plaques are also located elsewhere (pubis, buttocks, scalp elbows, knees). Rarely, psoriasis is localized only to the vulva. It commonly involves the crural and gluteal folds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms &ndash; Itching is usually mild or absent, but occasionally some degree of excoriation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lichenification may be encountered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis &ndash; A diagnosis of psoriasis can be made clinically, if typical psoriatic plaques are located elsewhere on the body. When only the vulva is involved, biopsy is necessary for definitive diagnosis. However, the pathology report may state &quot;psoriatic dermatitis.&quot; In such instances, the clinician needs to distinguish psoriasis from lichen simplex chronicus (see <a href=\"#H27976845\" class=\"local\">'Lichen simplex chronicus'</a> above), which can be difficult if itching and rubbing are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Large numbers of small vesicles and rarely bullae may erupt from the surface of the plaques. The vesicles break easily, leaving small patches of weeping erosions. This process can be confused with an eczematous candidiasis or impetigo. Erosions may also be due to excoriation. The inflammation that is locally present in allergic contact dermatitis may be sufficient to cause appreciable erythema and vulvar edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66955\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66955 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80139\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80139 \">picture 10</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms &ndash; The degree of itching and scratching is more variable than with atopic dermatitis. Some patients complain of burning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis &ndash; A clinical diagnosis is suggested by the presence of some combination of overlying eczematous features such as erythema, scale formation, visible erosion, weeping and crusting and a history of topical medication use. A more firm diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis can be made if discontinuation of all topical agents is followed by clearing of the eruption within 10 days. Biopsy is usually not helpful in separating allergic contact dermatitis from other eczematous disease unless numerous eosinophils are present within the dermal inflammatory infiltrate. In some instances, patch testing, often performed in a dermatologist's or allergist's office, is desirable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar dermatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If bullae are present, differential diagnosis includes bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus. Bullous pemphigoid also can have itchy lesions, but bullae are usually unilocular and tenser. Pemphigus vesicles and bullae are extremely fragile and are not itchy. (See <a href=\"#H27977568\" class=\"local\">'Pemphigoid'</a> below and <a href=\"#H27977580\" class=\"local\">'Pemphigus vulgaris'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27976863\"><span class=\"h2\">Irritant contact dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of this condition is excessive hygiene. The resulting dryness leads to a chapped appearance, with minute fissures. Urinary incontinence and use of pads are common causes of irritant contact dermatitis. Medications can also be responsible for the development of irritant contact dermatitis. Application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> regularly results in erosions superimposed on painful, red patches and plaques. Application of liquid nitrogen (for genital warts), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cantharidin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cantharidin</a> (for molluscum contagiosum) or bi- or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichloroacetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trichloroacetic acid</a> (for genital warts) almost always results in blisters that break down, leaving circular erosions, or even ulcers, with bits of lifted scale present at the periphery of the erosion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination &ndash; Red patches and plaques similar to those seen in other eczematous disease, such as atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66955\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66955 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80139\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80139 \">picture 10</a>) (see <a href=\"#H27976839\" class=\"local\">'Atopic dermatitis (eczema)'</a> above). However, the erythema may be duskier and may be brown red in color. Rarely, large numbers of small vesicles or bullae may erupt from the surface of the plaques. The vesicles break easily, leaving small patches of weeping erosions. This process can be confused with an eczematous candidiasis or impetigo. Fissuring may be present, which can result in a chapped appearance. Contact with extremely harsh products such as bi- or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichloroacetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trichloroacetic acid</a> can cause erosions or ulcers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms &ndash; The degree of itching and scratching is more variable than with atopic dermatitis. Some patients complain of burning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis &ndash; A diagnosis of irritant contact dermatitis is based on a history of either excessive hygiene or the persistent presence of too much moisture, such as might occur in diaper dermatitis or in bedridden, incontinent adults. Irritant contact dermatitis may also be induced by a patient&rsquo;s application of harsh chemicals (such as undiluted bleach, strong detergents, and rubbing alcohol) or a clinician&rsquo;s application of caustic medications (such as podophyllin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, and bi- or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichloroacetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trichloroacetic acid</a>).

Bullous pemphigoid also can have itchy lesions, but bullae are usually unilocular and tenser. Pemphigus vesicles and bullae are extremely fragile and are not itchy (see <a href=\"#H27977568\" class=\"local\">'Pemphigoid'</a> below and <a href=\"#H27977580\" class=\"local\">'Pemphigus vulgaris'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27976869\"><span class=\"h2\">Lichen planus (papulosquamous form)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of lichen planus is unknown, though lesions similar in clinical and histological appearance can occur in some drug reactions and in graft versus host (GVH) disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination &ndash; Lichen planus presents in several different ways in the anogenital area. The most common is erosive lichen planus (see <a href=\"#H27977677\" class=\"local\">'Erosive lichen planus'</a> below). Less often, it occurs as red or violaceous, sharply marginated, flat-topped papules <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plaques. In this papulosquamous form, scale is usually unapparent. Occasionally, there is evidence of the Koebner phenomenon (the appearance of lesions at sites of trauma), and the configuration of the lesions may be linear or angular rather than round. The distribution in the papulosquamous form of lichen planus spares the mucosal surfaces of the vestibule and the vagina, and, instead, lesions are found on the labia majora and surrounding cutaneous areas. Extragenital lesions are usually found in women with this papulosquamous form of lichen planus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A lacy (lattice-like) network of thin (&lt;1 mm) white or grey lines may be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61523\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61523 \">picture 11</a>). Similar changes, called Wickham&rsquo;s striae, may also be present on the buccal surfaces of the mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76338\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76338 \">picture 12</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms &ndash; Erosive lichen planus is painful, often exquisitely so. The papulosquamous form of lichen planus is either asymptomatic or somewhat pruritic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis &ndash; While a clinical diagnosis is often possible, we advise making an attempt to confirm the diagnosis with biopsy. The most prevalent histological finding is a lymphocyte-predominant band of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As with lichen sclerosus, biopsies to rule out superimposed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) should be performed for notably thickened or ulcerated areas.

The labia majora are typically spared. A distinctive feature is the regular presence of clearing (normal-appearing skin) in the center of these patches or plaques giving an annular appearance. The colloquial term, &quot;ringworm,&quot; has been used to describe this characteristic finding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms &ndash; Pruritus, sometimes marked, is usually present, but, in some patients, the lesions may be asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis &ndash; A clinical diagnosis is often possible, but should be confirmed by scraping some scale from the periphery of the lesion and either submitting it for fungal culture or microscopically examining the scale for hyphae using a potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatophyte-tinea-infections#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatophyte (tinea) infections&quot;, section on 'Tinea cruris'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517467479\"><span class=\"h2\">Perianal streptococcal infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perianal streptococcal infection is a bacterial infection common in children; however, it can occur in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination &ndash; Red patches on the perianal skin and, very rarely, on the vulva.

However, it can present with one or several red, sharply marginated plaques with varying amounts of overlying scale. Although not HPV related, this lesion can be similar in appearance to the usual type if it arises de novo from normal-appearing skin. However, more commonly, it develops against a background of other diseases, most often in the setting of lichen sclerosus or lichen planus. Less often, it is associated with other inflammatory disorders such as hidradenitis suppurativa or cutaneous Crohn disease. It tends to occur in older women. Differentiated vulvar lesions are referred to as dVIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-lesions-differential-diagnosis-based-on-morphology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The lesions are often solitary, but several may be present. They develop between the ages of 20 to 50 years and increase in number in pregnancy. In contrast to cherry angiomas, angiokeratomas are located only on the labia majora; their color is also different - dusky red to purple.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27976923\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemangiomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemangiomas are vascular malformations that are present at birth or develop in infancy and childhood.

The deeper, cavernous hemangiomas are purple, nodular swellings and can persist into adult life. Ulceration is the most common complication of hemangiomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74768\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74768 \">picture 22</a>).

When not associated with a follicle, the lesion is called an abscess. Lesions begin as a tender, red, firm papule that rapidly enlarges and becomes a deep-seated nodule that lasts for days. The nodule may be capped by a white or yellow-white pustule. It may gradually expand under the skin or point at the surface and rupture purulent material. Rarely, aggregates of infected furuncles form large, deep red masses.

The lesions often flare with the menstrual cycle. The lesions of hidradenitis suppurativa are differentiated from furuncles and abscesses by bacterial culture (in hidradenitis suppurativa, cultures are usually negative or show only nonpathogenic organisms; however, secondary infection of the lesions does occur). Other distinctive features include a marked tendency for recurrence at the same site and the poor response, even to long-term antibiotic therapy.

They are lined by epithelial cells, and their interior is filled with keratin made by these epithelial cells. The lesions are smooth, mobile, round, firm, papules or nodules, generally ranging in size from 2 mm to 2 cm in diameter; however, they can be smaller or larger. They occur on the labia majora, but not in the vulvar vestibule. Larger epidermal cysts are usually skin colored (if deep in the tissue) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95996\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95996 \">table 5</a>) or white (if more superficial) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95990\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95990 \">table 6</a>).

Occasionally, especially in more darkly pigmented individuals, they will have a yellow hue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95993\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95993 \">table 7</a>). Extrusion of keratin from the cyst into the adjacent dermis causes foreign body type inflammation, with consequent reddening of the nodule. The initial inflammation is not caused by bacterial infection, although, rarely, secondary infection of an already inflamed cyst occurs.</p><p>Small (1 to 3 mm) epidermal cysts (milia) are usually white papules, but these also may have a slightly yellow color.

Prurigo nodularis involving the vulva usually develops on the labia majora. The diagnosis is based on a history of chronic scratching and the characteristic clinical presentation.

Most often, these anogenital lesions occur after, or at the same time, that a diagnosis of intestinal Crohn disease is made.</p><p>The fistulae are surrounded by granulation tissue along the edges, forming slightly friable, red papules or small nodules that may cover the fistulous tract and closely mimic the appearance of hidradenitis suppurativa. For this reason, the axillae and the breasts should be examined as lesions in these locations suggest that the vulvar lesions are those of hidradenitis suppurativa rather than Crohn disease.</p><p>Vulvar edema occurs in a large percentage of women with Crohn disease, especially when the rectum is involved. Skin-colored or red swelling occurs in both the labia minora and labia majora. Early on, it is soft and pits easily; later, it becomes more firm and pits less easily. Diagnosis is established when edema of the vulva occurs in the setting of established intestinal Crohn disease. In a very few instances, the vulvar edema precedes a diagnosis of intestinal Crohn disease. For this reason, a history of gastrointestinal symptoms and possibly a work-up for inflammatory bowel disease should be obtained in the presence of what appears to be idiopathic vulvar edema.</p><p>A clinical diagnosis of Crohn disease can be confirmed by biopsy of vulvar abnormalities, which may show granulomatous inflammation (non-caseating granulomas) suggestive of Crohn disease. However, the granulomas in anogenital lesions may be less typical than those in the gastrointestinal tract and may be very similar to the granulomatous changes that are sometimes found in biopsies of hidradenitis suppurativa.

Mild itching may be present.</p><p>Typically, the lesions have a central umbilication with a white core (molluscum body) that can be scraped from the lesion by curettage. When this material is flattened on a microscope slide, a Giemsa stain will show the pathognomonic inclusion bodies made of viral protein. Alternatively, a shave biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis. These findings differentiate molluscum contagiosum from condyloma acuminata, nevi, basal cell carcinoma, and the lesions of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Lymphangiectatic lesions (superficial lymphangiomas) are firm, more cystic looking, and, when pierced with a needle, yield clear fluid.

Bites may be individually scattered over the mons pubis or buttocks, or sometimes along the panty line in the case of chiggers, or in groups, as from fleas. Scabies can present as red nodules in the vulvar area and buttocks in infants and the institutionalized elderly population. Insect bites can cause a significant reaction in a person who has been previously sensitized. History and clinical pattern suggest the diagnosis.

It presents as flat, white, sharply marginated patches that can expand centrifugally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80058\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80058 \">picture 33</a>). There is no scale. In the anogenital region, it may involve the labia majora, perineum, and perianal skin. Although in some patients vitiligo is restricted to the anogenital area, more commonly other sites such as the axillae, dorsal hands, elbows, knees, and periorificial facial skin are involved.</p><p>A clinical diagnosis of vulvar vitiligo is possible when the classical sites are also involved. Vitiligo must be differentiated from lichen sclerosus and from postinflammatory hypopigmentation, in which only partial loss of pigmentation occurs. If necessary, biopsy demonstrating the absence of melanocytes can be performed.

However, the patches are not as white, and the margins of the patches are less clearly defined than in vitiligo. Moreover, there is a history of preceding inflammation at the site. Postinflammatory hypopigmentation occurs more often, or at least is recognized more often, in individuals with naturally darker skin color. The disorder is a consequence of inflammation-induced damage to pigment-producing melanocytes and often occurs with preceding eczematous disease of varying types.</p><p>The diagnosis is made clinically when the lightening of the skin occurs at the site of previous or concomitant inflammatory disease.

Appreciable pain occurring in the involved dermatome is also regularly present (see <a href=\"#H27977550\" class=\"local\">'Herpes zoster'</a> below). Candidiasis is more superficial, the lesions are pustules rather than vesicles, and the lesions are smaller in size (see <a href=\"#H27976833\" class=\"local\">'Candidiasis'</a> above). Bullous impetigo is more superficial, with vesicles and bullae that break and form desquamating edges. (See <a href=\"#H27977556\" class=\"local\">'Bullous impetigo'</a> below.)</p><p>In significantly immunocompromised women, there may not be a history of a vesicular stage. Instead, the presentation is often that of nonhealing ulcers or ulcerated nodules. These ulcers are usually somewhat painful, but, in some instances, there is no appreciable pain. Because of the inability to muster a suitable immune response, the ulcers may persist for weeks to months.</p><p>A diagnosis of herpes simplex should be considered in immunosuppressed women with nonhealing ulcers (especially if a gyrate configuration is present). A suspected diagnosis should be confirmed by immunofluorescence, PCR-based testing, or viral culture. Material for these tests may be obtained by gently scraping the edge and the base of the ulcer. If these studies are negative, serological tests for syphilis should be obtained, and biopsy should be performed to rule out aphthous ulcers, chancroid, pyoderma gangrenosum (see <a href=\"#H27977809\" class=\"local\">'Pyoderma gangrenosum'</a> below), and ulcerated malignancy.

Within a day or two, groups of one to five vesicles appear on the surface of the plaques. These vesicles often coalesce into larger bullae that may be purpuric. In the anogenital region, the blisters usually extend unilaterally along the buttocks to the labia majora and minora. The blister roofs break down quickly and easily, leaving painful, open, grouped erosions (3 to 7 mm). Usually, there are bits of loose scale (collarette scale) at the periphery of the erosions. Occasionally, the lesions become confluent, leaving larger erosions possessing a gyrate configuration.</p><p>A diagnosis can usually be established clinically based on the morphology. However, viral culture, immunofluorescent, or PCR-based identification may be desirable, considering that approximately 10 percent of the patients with the above morphology turn out to have herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, rather than varicella-zoster virus infection.

HSV is usually more limited and often crosses the midline, while herpes zoster is classically unilateral along a dermatome. Bullous impetigo has thin-walled vesicles and bullae, which are culture positive for <em>S. aureus</em>. Bullous pemphigoid has firm, thick-walled bullae. Neither condition is as painful as herpes zoster.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27977556\"><span class=\"h2\">Bullous impetigo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impetigo of the bullous type is usually caused by <em>S. aureus</em> and less often by <em>Streptococcus</em> species. The lesions initially consist of thin-walled, fragile vesicles and bullae. These break down quickly, leaving round erosions with collarettes of scale. Anogenital impetigo occurs on the keratinized skin of the labia, labiocrural folds, upper inner thighs, and mons pubis. Occasionally, the vesicles and bullae remain intact for several days, and, when this occurs, the gradual accumulation of white blood cells results in yellow-white blister fluid. In addition to vesicles and bullae, one or more follicular red papules or pustules (bacterial folliculitis) are also often present.</p><p>Bullous impetigo can be confused with blistering diseases as the erosions in all of these diseases have well-demarcated, superficial peeling edges. Diagnosis is made through the recovery of <em>S. aureus</em> or <em>Streptococcus</em> species on culture from the blister fluid or from the surface of the erosion that occurs after the blister roof is gone.

The blisters may arise either on normal-appearing skin or from the surface of the red plaques. They are thick walled, tense, unilocular, and filled with straw-colored to hemorrhagic fluid. They are less fragile than those that occur in impetigo, pemphigus, or contact dermatitis. Because the blisters are not fragile, the clinical presentation will likely be a mix of intact blisters and erosions with loose bits of scale (collarette scale) at the periphery of the erosions. The distribution in the anogenital area includes the mons pubis, buttocks, thighs, and labia majora. When the lesions rupture, they leave erosions that heal without scarring.

At both sites, the ulcers are painful and sharply marginated (punched out) and may have a white coagulum or adherent, black crust at the base of the ulcer. In contrast to oral ulcers, vulvar ulcers are more likely to be large (up to 3 cm), may involve the skin as well as the modified mucous membranes of the vestibule, assume a gyrate configuration when two or more adjacent ulcers grow into confluence, and heal more slowly (over two or three weeks).</p><p>The majority of patients have flulike symptoms that precede or accompany the ulcers. They typically occur in girls and young women between the ages of 8 and 25 years. Approximately half of the patients have had, or will develop, oral aphthous ulcers. Approximately one-third of the patients have had, or will develop, recurrent vulvar aphthous ulcers.</p><p>The diagnosis is based on the clinical findings, but viral culture to rule out herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection and biopsy to rule out other causes of vulvar ulceration, such as syphilis and chancroid, can be indicated if the clinician is uncertain.</p><p>Acute aphthous ulcers may occur in association with various infections. The most common is Epstein-Barr virus. The list includes <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, viral upper respiratory infection (parvovirus, influenza, paramyxovirus) or gastroenteritis (salmonella), toxoplasmosis, <em>Streptococcus</em>, mumps, cytomegalovirus, and Lyme disease.
