People with the disorder sometimes bruise easily or bleed too much when they get cut.</p><p>Von Willebrand disease is usually caused by a gene and runs in families. In some cases, a family might not know about it if the disease is mild. Rarely, people can get von Willebrand disease because of another condition, rather than a gene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29329459\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of von Willebrand disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of von Willebrand disease are often mild. For some people, the symptoms are so mild that they never have problems.</p><p>If you have von Willebrand disease, you might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get nosebleeds a lot or have nosebleeds that last a long time</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Notice that your gums sometimes bleed for no reason</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruise easily and form lumps under your bruises</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have very heavy or long-lasting periods (if you are a woman). For instance, your periods might last longer than 7 to 10 days and have large blood clots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleed more than normal when having medical procedures or surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleed when you take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or other medicines that prevent blood clots</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29329466\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for von Willebrand disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have von Willebrand disease, he or she can check for it with a blood test. He or she will also want to know as much as possible about the way you have bled in the past. Plus, your doctor or nurse will want to know if any of your family members have the disorder or have had problems with bleeding or bruising.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29329473\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to reduce bleeding?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Follow these tips:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not take medicines that have <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, or medicines called &quot;NSAIDs&quot; without talking to your doctor first. Examples of NSAIDs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). These medicines can make bleeding worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be extra safe about preventing injuries if your doctor tells you to. For example, you might need to avoid contact sports, like hockey or football.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plan ahead for surgery or childbirth. If you are going to have surgery or any procedure that might make you bleed, talk to your doctor or nurse about your condition first. Do the same if you are going to have a baby. That way your doctor or nurse can be ready with the right medicines if you start to bleed too much.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29329480\"><span class=\"h1\">How is von Willebrand disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many medicines used to treat von Willebrand disease. These medicines come in shots, pills, gels, and nasal sprays. You and your doctor or nurse might have to try a few different treatment approaches before you find the one that works best for you.</p><p>Women might also need to do some things to make their periods lighter and shorter. This can involve taking birth control or hormones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29329487\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to have a baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to have a baby, your doctor or nurse should watch you closely during your pregnancy. That way he or she can make sure that bleeding does not become an issue.</p><p>Most women do not need treatment while they are pregnant, because von Willebrand disease is usually less severe during pregnancy. But after the baby is born, women can start to have serious bleeding. For 1 to 3 weeks after giving birth, women often need to take extra medicines to prevent bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29329584\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-care-of-bruises-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking care of bruises (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=von-willebrand-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: von Willebrand disease (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
