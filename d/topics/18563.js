The procedure involves interruption or occlusion of each vas deferens and is typically performed in an outpatient setting under local anesthesia.</p><p>This topic discusses patient counseling, preoperative preparation, surgical techniques, postoperative care and complications, and reversal of vasectomy. The effect of vasectomy on the patient's overall health (eg, cardiovascular or prostate cancer) is also discussed. Alternative methods of contraception are discussed in another topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915652703\"><span class=\"h1\">UTILIZATION AND COST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worldwide, almost 43 million men underwent vasectomy in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Slightly more than one-half million vasectomies were performed in the United States (US) in 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Data collected in the US in 2002 also showed that vasectomy was used by 5.7 percent of men ages 15 to 44, making it the fourth most commonly used contraceptive method, after condoms, oral contraceptives, and tubal ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Approximately 79 percent of vasectomies in the US were performed by urologists, 13 percent by family physicians, and 8 percent by general surgeons. The cost of the procedure ranges from $350 to $1000, which is below costs associated with long-term pharmacologic contraception or female sterilization procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Reported rates of successful infertility after vasectomy exceed 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], though data are limited by lack of long-term follow-up. Most studies report outcomes only within two years of the procedure and might not account for subsequent failures due to later recanalization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1628977806\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary care provider should discuss the procedure with the patient prior to arranging the referral. This initial discussion should provide information about the nature of the procedure and alternative contraceptive options, as well as address patient expectations and questions. The discussion between patient and referring clinician should review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraception method(s) used and patient understanding of alternatives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient understanding that the procedure results in permanent sterility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Social/family</span> status: whether in stable relationship, number and ages of children (if any), acceptance of procedure by partner, future family intent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient understanding of the need for interim contraception for a minimum of three months and semen analysis prior to assuming sterility.

However, the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for vasectomy state that clinicians do <strong>not</strong> need to routinely discuss coronary heart disease, stroke, dementia, hypertension, prostate cancer, or testicular cancer in pre-vasectomy counseling of patients because vasectomy is not a risk factor for such conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3137971710\" class=\"local\">'Associated morbidity concerns'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3873015547\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to vasectomy, medical history should assess for abnormalities in sexual development and history of genital injury <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery. Additionally, the patient should have a complete genital examination to confirm the presence of a single vas deferens and testicle on each side and absence of anatomic abnormalities. Patients with a history of solitary testicle, extensive genital surgery, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anatomic abnormalities (such as a nonpalpable vas deferens) should be referred to a urologist.</p><p><strong>Contraindications</strong> to vasectomy include the presence of scrotal hematoma, genitourinary or groin infection, and sperm granuloma, but the procedure can often be performed if these issues can be resolved. Bleeding diathesis or presence of a local anatomic abnormality (eg, varicocele, hydrocele, scrotal mass, cryptorchidism) may challenge office-based vasectomy, and thus urology referral is prudent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Routine preoperative laboratory tests, prophylactic antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and fasting are unnecessary. The patient should arrange transportation home after the procedure.</p><p>Patients should avoid taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for seven days prior to the procedure, as these may increase the risk of postoperative bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;, section on 'Medications affecting hemostasis'</a>.)</p><p>An anxiolytic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 10 mg orally) can be given approximately one hour prior to the procedure to help the patient relax. This also helps surgical isolation of the vas deferens by relaxing scrotal and cremasteric muscles. Informed consent must be obtained prior to anxiolytic administration.</p><p>Application of a topical anesthetic cream reduces the pain of the anesthetic injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A commonly used topical anesthetic cream is EMLA (ie, &quot;Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics&quot;), which is a mixture of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> (2.5%) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prilocaine</a> (2.5%) in a cream base. To be effective, EMLA should be applied by the patient to the anterior scrotum approximately one hour prior to the procedure. Covering the area with a plastic wrap or transparent film dressing minimizes evaporation and facilitates absorption of the cream. Dosing is weight dependent, and systemic toxicity (ie, methemoglobinemia) is unlikely if EMLA cream is applied correctly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-anesthetics-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical anesthetics in children&quot;, section on 'EMLA'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3193093423\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knowledge of surgical anatomy will help ensure safe, efficient, effective vasectomy. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Innervation &ndash; The anterior scrotal skin and spermatic cord are innervated by fibers from the ilioinguinal nerve and genital branches of the genitofemoral nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 1</a>). Local blockade of these nerves provides adequate anesthesia for vasectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Layers of the scrotum &ndash; Just beneath the scrotal skin lie (from outermost to innermost) the dartos fascia and muscle, the external spermatic fascia, and the cremasteric fascia and muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72166\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72166 \">figure 2</a>). The internal spermatic fascia is deep to these structures and covers the spermatic cord, which contains the vas deferens and neurovascular supply to the ipsilateral testis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasculature &ndash; The spermatic cord also contains the deferential artery (artery of the vas deferens) and the pampiniform plexus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72166\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72166 \">figure 2</a>). The pampiniform plexus consists of 8 or 10 veins that lie adjacent to the vas deferens and ultimately drain into the testicular vein. These veins are easily injured during aggressive dissection of the spermatic cord. Dilatation of the pampiniform plexus (termed varicocele) is a common abnormality and usually occurs on the left. A varicocele can make isolation of the vas deferens more difficult.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VASECTOMY TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasectomy is a surgical procedure that divides and occludes the vas deferens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The procedure takes approximately 15 minutes and can be performed in an appropriately equipped office or ambulatory surgery center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The two most widely used vasectomy techniques are: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conventional vasectomy</strong> &ndash; This traditional vasectomy approach involves bilateral scrotal incisions through which each vas deferens is mobilized and transected. This technique accounts for a small proportion of vasectomies performed in the United States (US) but remains the most common technique in many other areas of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>No-scalpel vasectomy</strong> &ndash; The no-scalpel vasectomy technique was developed in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Instead of incisions, a puncture is made through the scrotal skin overlying the vas deferens and widened only enough to externalize the vas deferens for transection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The remainder of the procedure is performed in a similar fashion to the open incision method. There is no difference in effectiveness compared with the standard approach, but the no-scalpel approach is associated with less bleeding, infection, and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. No-scalpel vasectomy is the preferred vasectomy technique in the US because of its lower complication rates, but it has yet to be adopted worldwide. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Equipment needed to perform a vasectomy includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Povidone iodine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> to cleanse the scrotal skin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile drapes, sterile gloves, sterile gauze.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrocautery equipment or disposable thermal cautery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sutures (4-0 absorbable [chromic or polyglactin 910] preferably on a noncutting needle).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10-mL syringe with a 1.5-inch 25- or 27-gauge needle for administering local anesthetics.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1% or 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (maximum dose 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/pound])</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical instruments: vas fixation clamp and sharp dissecting forceps, straight scissors, needle holder.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is asked to lie supine on the procedure table. It is helpful to position and secure the penis onto the lower abdomen (eg, with surgical drape, adhesive tape, or umbilical tape). Hair is clipped from the anterior scrotum, which is then prepared with an antiseptic solution. Sterile towels are used to drape the area surrounding the scrotum, and sterile technique is employed for the remainder of the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vas deferens is isolated and positioned to lie as superficially as possible beneath the median raphe of the scrotal skin anteriorly, midway between the top of the testes and the base of the penis. This is usually accomplished using the nondominant hand and a &quot;three-finger technique&quot; to manipulate the vas within the scrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78720\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78720 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Local anesthetic without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> (0.5 to 1 mL) is injected into the skin to create a wheal over the vas. A large wheal is avoided because it will interfere with isolating the vas.</p><p>Next, a vasal nerve block to anesthetize the deeper tissues can be performed in the following manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. With tension on the vas, the needle is advanced through the anesthetized scrotal skin approximately 2 to 3 cm along the sheath of the vas (but not into the vas) toward the inguinal ring, and 2 to 5 mL of anesthetic (depending on concentration) is injected into the tissue surrounding the vas; there should not be any resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some operators then anesthetize the contralateral vas to allow ample time for the anesthetic to take effect.</p><p>An alternate anesthetic method involves a no-needle jet injection technique that uses a high-pressure spray to deliver local anesthetic through the scrotal skin and into the tissue surrounding the vas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. We have used this technique very successfully for the past several years. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposing the vas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vas is positioned under the skin wheal as close to the skin as possible, and a vas fixation clamp can be used to gently entrap the vas and a minimal amount of overlying tightly stretched skin.</p><p>For the conventional technique, a small (&lt;1 cm) incision is made and carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissue to expose the vas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55770\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55770 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p>For the no-scalpel technique, a sharp mosquito hemostat is used to puncture through the scrotal skin with care not to go through the vas. An opening approximately twice the width of the vas is made by gently spreading with both tips of the hemostat. </p><p>If a vas fixating clamp is in place, it can be left alone or repositioned as needed. If the vas has not been fixed in a clamp, it should now be grasped. The vas is elevated through the incision or opening with an Allis clamp, towel clamp, or dissecting forceps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53549\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53549 \">picture 3</a>). The perivasal tissue is dissected and separated using a dissecting hemostat. Then, approximately 2 centimeters of the vas are brought up as a loop gently and grasped with a second vas fixating clamp, towel clip, or ring forceps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F74357\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74357 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>The loop of vas is cleaned of residual tissue with care to avoid trauma to the associated blood vessels. Gauze can be used to achieve blunt dissection. Alternatively, the tip of a hemostat or tips of the dissecting forceps can be inserted into the window of the vas deferens loop and gently spread to completely isolate the vas. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Dividing the vas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vas is divided, and a segment of vas is removed, although the minimum length of vas that needs be removed to prevent recanalization is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Rates of recanalization more likely reflect the technique used to manage the vasal ends than the actual length of the segment removed. We favor excision of a segment 10 to 15 mm in length. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Managing the vasal ends'</a> below.)</p><p>If a segment is removed, it can be sent for pathologic confirmation. The author routinely sends the excised segments for pathologic analysis; others do not. Although pathologic analysis of excised vas has little clinical benefit, histologic documentation that full-thickness vas was excised can be helpful in the event of vasectomy failure. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Vasectomy failure'</a> below.)</p><p>Irrigation of the prostatic end does not have any documented benefit. Three randomized trials failed to demonstrate any acceleration of sperm clearance by irrigation of the prostatic end during vasectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Managing the vasal ends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal method of managing the testicular vasal end is debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/24-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-30</a>]. Several acceptable methods of occluding the vasal ends can be used, but, in general, using ligatures or clips should be avoided. Intraluminal fulguration of the prostatic end of the vas with fascial interposition between the prostatic and testicular vasal ends appears to be the most effective method for managing the vasal ends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/13,24,26,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24,26,31-34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Vasectomy failure'</a> below.)</p><p>Fulguration using a battery-powered handheld cautery (red-hot wire) appears to scar and occlude the vas lumen more effectively than electrocautery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61651\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61651 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62120\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62120 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Fascial interposition creates a tissue barrier between the vasal ends and reduces vasectomy failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Absorbable suture or a clip is used to tack a layer of the vas sheath between the two cut vasal ends (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70870\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70870 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66760 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of the combined approach (fulguration and fascial interposition) was illustrated in a study of the outcome of 6248 vasectomies performed using fascial interposition in conjunction with thermal cautery of both ends (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70870\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70870 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66760 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. No failures (ie, pregnancies) occurred, and there was a low rate of complications (congestive epididymitis in 4.8 percent, sperm granuloma in 1.4 percent). Of note, the surgeons did not remove a vas segment or apply ligatures or clips to the open vasal ends.</p><p>Ligation alone of the vasal ends should be avoided. A review of six studies that assessed this method (ie, &quot;cut and tie vasectomy&quot;) reported failure rates of 1 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Failure may have been due to ischemic sloughing of the vasal ends, which increases the potential for spontaneous recanalization. </p><p>Conventional wisdom suggests that both vasal ends should be occluded by fulguration, ligation, or clips; however, some experts advocate leaving the testicular end untreated (open-ended vasectomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. The rationale for leaving one end open is that sperm leakage from the testicular cut end prevents inspissation, increased epididymal pressure, and epididymal rupture and allows a small sperm granuloma to form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The value of this approach is supported by a study of 4330 open-ended and 3867 standard vasectomies (segment excised, cautery of both cut surfaces, ligation of both ends, fascial interposition) that found lower rates of complications with the open-ended approach: congestive epididymitis (1.2 versus 2.7 percent), painful sperm granuloma (1.5 versus 3.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. There were no significant differences between techniques in the rates of spontaneous recanalization (0.02 versus 0.08 percent).</p><p>The open-ended technique can be offered to the patient. However, in our experience, most men choose to have both ends occluded. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Sperm granuloma'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The perivasal tissues are carefully inspected for bleeding and gently returned to the scrotum. If the incisional approach is used, one to two absorbable sutures are placed in the scrotal skin. In the no-scalpel technique, skin closure is not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], but skin glue can be applied if desired.</p><p>Once the procedure is completed, we dress the wound with antibiotic ointment and a bandage. A fluff dressing is placed and the patient is assisted in putting on tight-fitting underwear or a scrotal support.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dressing and scrotal support are maintained for at least 48 hours after surgery. An ice pack intermittently applied to the scrotum for 24 to 48 hours also helps decrease discomfort and swelling.</p><p>Postprocedure pain varies with the technique and surgeon experience and can occur in up to 30 percent of patients but is usually self-limited. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> usually provides sufficient analgesia, although occasionally narcotic analgesics are necessary.</p><p>Postoperative instructions should be reviewed with the patient. Mild pain, swelling, and bruising are normal for the first two to three days. The patient should call for increasing pain, bleeding from the incision site, fever, or significant scrotal swelling.</p><p>Bed rest or gentle activity is recommended for the first 24 hours following a vasectomy. The patient may return to light work in two to three days but should refrain from heavy work, sports, or lifting for one week.</p><p>Sexual activity is avoided for one week. The patient and his partner should be reminded to use an alternate method of contraception until semen analysis has confirmed absence of sperm (azoospermia) in the ejaculate. Since sperm are stored along the entire vas deferens and in the seminal vesicle, interruption of the vas does not result in immediate sterility, and several ejaculations are required to evacuate all of the sperm.

A systematic review including 56 studies reported the time to achieve azoospermia was variable, but more than 80 percent of men were azoospermic after three months and 20 ejaculations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The time to achieve azoospermia declines with increasing number of ejaculations following vasectomy and increases with patient age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. A coital frequency of at least three times per week seems to be associated with more rapid clearance, regardless of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Azoospermia in a semen sample is definitive evidence of infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Although an at-home test is available that allows the patient to monitor sperm count after vasectomy, we recommend formal laboratory testing to confirm any results prior to assuming sterility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The laboratory performing the analysis should examine a fresh specimen using direct microscopy; if sperm are not seen on the initial prepared slide, a centrifuged specimen should be evaluated. </p><p>If there are motile sperm at the three-month check-up, a follow-up test is performed in another one to two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Vasectomy is considered a failure if motile sperm are confirmed on the follow-up examination, there have been a sufficient number of ejaculations (&gt;20), and &gt;3 months have elapsed since the procedure. The patient should be advised to use alternative contraception and potentially undergo a repeat procedure. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Vasectomy failure'</a> below.)</p><p>Azoospermia is the ideal endpoint of vasectomy. A small proportion of patients, however, do not achieve azoospermia but consistently have nonmotile sperm. Nonmotility is a less definitive sign of infertility than azoospermia since it may reflect death of recently motile sperm due to a prolonged delay between ejaculation and laboratory analysis. The accuracy of determining whether sperm have normal motility is dependent on the timely examination of the semen specimen, ideally less than four hours from the time collected by the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. When rare, nonmotile sperm are observed, a repeat test in another one to two months may show azoospermia or continued presence of rare, nonmotile sperm.</p><p>The continued presence of rare, nonmotile sperm is probably clinically insignificant, and these men can be given cautious assurance of success. Guidelines from the British Andrology Society recommend that patients be given &quot;special clearance&quot; to discontinue other contraception, following appropriate counseling, provided they have a low sperm count <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;10,000/mL),</span> all sperm are immotile, seven months have elapsed from vasectomy, and there have been a minimum of 24 ejaculations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The American Urologic Association guidelines state that patients may stop using other methods of contraception when examination of one well-mixed, uncentrifuged, fresh post-vasectomy semen specimen shows azoospermia or only rare nonmotile sperm (defined as presence of &le;100,000 nonmotile <span class=\"nowrap\">sperm/mL</span> based on microscopic exam of at least 50 high-powered fields) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications following vasectomy include hematoma, infection, sperm granuloma, and persistent post-vasectomy pain. The most important determinant of postoperative complications is operator experience. In one study, surgeons performing more than 50 vasectomies during the year studied had one-third the complication rate of those performing fewer than 10 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematoma formation is the most common complication associated with vasectomy. In rare cases, bleeding may be severe enough to require reoperation for scrotal exploration, hematoma evacuation, and control of bleeding. The most common site of bleeding is the pampiniform plexus of veins. </p><p>Hematoma rates are lower for no-scalpel procedures, where tissue dissection is minimized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/32,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,51</a>]. Hematoma formation occurs in 0.1 to 2.1 percent of men undergoing no-scalpel procedures compared with 0.3 to 10.7 percent for incisional technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trials comparing no-scalpel and conventional incisional techniques also demonstrate lower wound infection rates for no-scalpel procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/32,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,51</a>]. Infection rates reported for the no-scalpel and incisional techniques are 0.2 to 0.9 and 1.3 to 4 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Sperm granuloma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sperm are highly antigenic and stimulate a significant inflammatory reaction. A sperm granuloma may form when sperm leaks from the testicular side of an open-ended vas following vasectomy. Less commonly, they may form with extravasation from a cauterized or fulgurated vas.</p><p>These granulomas are rarely symptomatic and may be protective to the testis and epididymis. The granuloma is rich in epithelial-lined channels that may vent leaking sperm away from the epididymis and protect against increased intraepididymal pressure.</p><p>Most granulomas are asymptomatic and over time will ultimately resorb. Granulomas, however, have been implicated in increased rates of post-vasectomy pain and in vas recanalization related to the inflammatory response induced by the antigenic reaction to sperm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Patients with an acute symptomatic granuloma typically present two to three weeks after vasectomy, after they have resumed sexual activities. A tender mass can be palpated near the cut testicular end of the vas. Most patients respond to supportive care including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); surgery is rarely needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3648227300\"><span class=\"h2\">Epididymitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congestive epididymitis can occur at any time after vasectomy. The open-ended technique may in theory reduce that risk. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Managing the vasal ends'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-vasectomy pain syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Post-vasectomy pain syndrome is distinct from postprocedure pain; however, there is some controversy regarding its definition and therefore prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Historically, rates for post-vasectomy pain syndrome have been reported as very low (&lt;1 percent). However, surveys have found that the incidence of &quot;troublesome&quot; post-vasectomy pain is reported by approximately 15 percent of men, with pain severe enough to impact quality of life in 2 percent; survey respondents, however, may not have been representative of all post-vasectomy men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>].</p><p>The cause of most post-vasectomy pain syndromes is chronic congestive epididymitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Testicular fluid and sperm production remain constant following vasectomy. The majority of this fluid accumulates in the epididymis, which then swells. While asymptomatic in most men, some will develop a chronic dull ache in the testes, which is made worse by ejaculation. Other causes or contributors to pain syndromes include the formation of sperm granuloma, or nerve entrapment at the vasectomy site.</p><p>First-line therapy for post-vasectomy pain is the administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and warm baths. If unsuccessful, local nerve blocks or steroid injections may be performed by a pain specialist. If the post-vasectomy patient's discomfort is localized to a tender, palpable granuloma, this may be excised, followed by fulguration of the leaking end of the vas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. </p><p>Refractory cases may require surgery, including either vasectomy reversal (vasovasostomy) or complete epididymectomy. Vasovasostomy successfully relieves pain in up to 70 to 82 percent of well-selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. These patients, however, will almost always require the use of another form of contraception as a result. (See <a href=\"#H165064690\" class=\"local\">'Vasectomy reversal'</a> below.)</p><p>Complete epididymal resection is reserved for the most severe cases. Injury to the testicular blood supply, a known complication of this procedure, causes testicular atrophy. Thirty to 90 percent of patients undergoing epididymectomy for post-vasectomy orchialgia will have residual scrotal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Vasectomy failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasectomy failure can be due to technical errors, recanalization, or unprotected intercourse before azoospermia is documented. </p><p>The varying techniques employed in vasectomy to fulgurate, ligate, and manage the vasal ends are associated with different failure rates. Representative failure rates are listed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cautery (both ends) and fascial interruption: 1.2 percent or less</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cautery (prostatic end only) and fascial interruption (clip): 0.02 to 2.4 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cautery of both ends and excision of a segment: 4.8 percent or less</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ligation and fascial interruption: 16.7 percent or less</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ligation and excision of segment: 1.5 to 29 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraluminal needle cautery (vas not transected, no segment removed; rarely performed in North America): Less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/30,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,64</a>]</p><p/><p>Recanalization is rare, occurring in approximately 0.2 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Vasectomy can be reversed with microsurgical techniques. Vasectomy reversal involves reanastomosis (vasovasostomy) of the vas deferens, ideally at the site of the previous ligation. Successful vasectomy reversal has been reported in 50 to 70 percent of men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Rates decline with increasing time between vasectomy and reversal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p>Multiple studies have examined the relationship between patient characteristics and the likelihood of a future request for vasectomy reversal. The strongest predictive factor for a vasectomy reversal is a change in marital status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Men without children, and men who were older than 30 years at the time of vasectomy, were less likely to request a reversal in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. There was no correlation between a patient's religion, number of marriages, or occupation and the probability of a future request for reversal.</p><p>Key determinants of success and patency of reversal are the method of vasectomy and the duration of obstruction. An effort has been made to prevent irreversible damage at the time of vasectomy. This has led to the development of the open-ended vasectomy. The leaked sperm cause an immune response that may result in a sperm granuloma but reduces the risk of concomitant tubular damage. Sealing the testicular side of the cut end of the vas may result in epididymal damage and decreased vasectomy reversal success.</p><p>A large retrospective study found patency rates (sperm present in ejaculate) of &gt;95 percent and a pregnancy rate of approximately 75 percent for men who underwent vasectomy fewer than three years prior to reversal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Both rates decreased in a linear fashion as the duration of obstruction increased. A patency rate of 71 percent and pregnancy rate of 30 percent was reported for men who underwent vasovasostomy 15 years after vasectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3137971710\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED MORBIDITY CONCERNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common sterilization procedure for women, tubal ligation, requires entering the peritoneal cavity to access the fallopian tubes and is usually performed under general anesthesia. Compared with tubal ligation, vasectomy is safer, is less costly, and has a significantly shorter postprocedure recovery time. Nonetheless, worldwide, tubal ligation is performed five times more often than vasectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. This finding suggests lower acceptance of vasectomy, which may be attributed to a variety of reasons, including misperceptions of the procedure and its side effects.

Although observational studies may show an association, these do not prove a causal relationship between vasectomy and prostate cancer and cannot exclude bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/75-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-84</a>]. As such, we agree with the American Urological Association guidelines that state&nbsp;clinicians do not need to routinely discuss prostate cancer in pre-vasectomy counseling.

Patients should be thoroughly counseled about the permanence of the procedure, potential risks and benefits, failure rates, and alternatives. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1628977806\" class=\"local\">'Patient counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to vasectomy, medical history should assess for abnormalities in sexual development and history of genital injury <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery. Additionally, the patient should have a complete genital examination to confirm the presence of a single vas deferens and testicle on each side and absence of anatomic abnormalities. Patients with a history of solitary testicle, extensive genital surgery, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anatomic abnormalities (such as a nonpalpable vas deferens) should be referred to a urologist. (See <a href=\"#H3873015547\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative preparation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasectomy is usually performed as an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia. To perform vasectomy, the vas is isolated and brought up through a scrotal skin incision (conventional) or puncture site (no-scalpel technique). The vas is transected, a segment is removed, and the prostatic end fulgurated. The testicular end is handled variably. Ideally, a fascial interposition is created to isolate the vasal ends from each other. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Vasectomy techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest a no-scalpel approach rather than conventional vasectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Non-scalpel vasectomy has lower bleeding and infection rates. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Vasectomy techniques'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Exposing the vas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest intraluminal fulguration of the prostatic end and fascial interposition to manage the vasal ends, rather than another technique (eg, clipping or ligation) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Fulguration and fascial interposition have been associated with lower rates of complications and failures. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Managing the vasal ends'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative care includes scrotal support, intermittent ice application, and rest. Sexual activity should be avoided for at least one week, and an alternative method of contraception is advised until azoospermia is confirmed by semen analysis at three months after the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2173911565\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up to confirm sterility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematoma is the most common complication of vasectomy.

Vasectomy reversal involves reanastomosis (vasovasostomy) of the reproductive tract, ideally at the site of the previous ligation of the vas deferens. Successful vasectomy reversal has been reported in 50 to 70 percent of men. Key determinants of success and patency of reversal are the method of vasectomy and the duration of obstruction.

(See <a href=\"#H3137971710\" class=\"local\">'Associated morbidity concerns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative methods of vasal occlusion (microsurgical vasal plug, polymer injection) seek to provide a reversible mode of contraception for men. These methods are still largely investigational at the present time. (See <a href=\"#H3368463695\" class=\"local\">'Alternative vasal occlusion techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H663053451\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Theodore J Ongaro, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Peterson HB, Curtis KM.
