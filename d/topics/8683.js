Imaging studies of the joint, in combination with clinical and laboratory evaluation, are often helpful in establishing a specific diagnosis. The choice of imaging procedure is based upon the clinical situation, the differential diagnostic considerations, and the availability of specific imaging modalities. Guidelines for the use of musculoskeletal imaging for specific clinical situations are included among the <a href=\"http://www.acr.org/Quality-Safety/Appropriateness-Criteria&amp;token=51PKtqdAb/SA0RAD0tuZwzduQFDAh4mIQIhPzhkry117dh6Ytk+xIedOC+9rkiQTPF7on5OAtOAp9vO6hZ3Kfa8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6921\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">American College of Radiology appropriateness criteria</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Sufficient history should be provided to assist the radiologist in study interpretation. Thus, the quality and location of pain, as well as any history of trauma, pertinent medical history, and laboratory data, are invaluable information when interpreting an imaging study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>An overview of the use of the diagnostic imaging modalities and techniques to evaluate joint pain is presented here. Detailed discussions of these techniques in specific diseases are presented separately (see appropriate topic reviews), as is the use of musculoskeletal ultrasound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-nomenclature-technical-considerations-validation-and-standardization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Nomenclature, technical considerations, validation, and standardization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Clinical applications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-guided-injection-and-aspiration-of-joints-and-related-structures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Guided injection and aspiration of joints and related structures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiography remains the initial imaging choice in many, if not most, bone and joint disorders. Radiography utilizes a radiograph tube with a two-dimensional image detector, a sheet of film, or digital detector. In most radiology departments, radiographic images are digital and thus are interpreted on a computer display.</p><p>Radiographs have the greatest resolution of all available imaging modalities. Densities that can be distinguished on radiographs are calcium, soft tissue, fat, and air. Radiography is especially useful for detecting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evaluating:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periosteal reaction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft tissue calcification or ossification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized lesions of bone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthopedic hardware</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone dysplasias and other skeletal deformities</p><p/><p>Two systems are available to produce digital projection radiographs, computed radiography and digital radiography. Computed radiography (CR) was introduced commercially in the early 1980s. In a CR system, a photostimulable storage phosphor screen or image plate acts as the detector that interacts with the x-rays, thus capturing a latent image; a laser light is used to stimulate the phosphor to luminesce, thus extracting the latent image from the screen and converting it into a digital image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In CR, traditional film cassettes are replaced by storage phosphor cassettes, and chemical film processing is replaced by CR readers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The images can be printed onto film or can be transmitted to a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) workstation.</p><p>Digital radiography (DR), introduced in the 1990s, refers to devices in which the digitization of the radiograph signal takes place within the detector itself. This approach provides an immediate full-fidelity image on a display monitor. Detection devices can use either a direct or an indirect conversion mechanism.</p><p>Both CR and DR systems provide greater latitude than film screen systems and decrease the number of images that need to be repeated. The advantages of direct radiography include increased productivity and equivalent or better image quality at a potentially lower radiation dose to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Images are rapidly available for checking image quality and for interpretation, and systems can be networked for easy distribution of images.</p><p>The expense of installing CR or DR equipment is a disadvantage of digital radiography. DR systems coupled with a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) allow images to be captured, stored, reviewed, interpreted, and distributed within minutes. DR systems are most often installed in high-volume areas, while CR systems can provide digital imaging to lower-volume areas at decreased expense and can provide a mechanism for capturing difficult examinations such as bedside &quot;portables.&quot;</p><p>Regardless of which display method is used, a minimum of two radiographic projections at right angles are usually obtained to fully appreciate the area of interest, since abnormalities can potentially be obscured by superimposition. Standardized imaging protocols are used for most joints. Radiographic examination is relatively inexpensive, rapid, and nearly universally available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluoroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a &quot;real-time&quot; radiographic imaging modality, fluoroscopy can be used to observe the motion of joints and to guide proper needle insertion into deep-seated joints, such as the hip or sacroiliac joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It may also accurately detect focal cortical disease, fractures, and ligamentous instability, as the patient can be optimally positioned or a specific joint can be mechanically stressed under real-time imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Arthrography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generally, radiographic examinations show soft tissues (e.g. muscles, cartilage, joint fluid, menisci) to be the same density and therefore indistinguishable from one another. Arthrography refers to imaging following the injection of contrast material into a joint, and is often performed using fluoroscopic guidance. The injected contrast outlines intraarticular structures and differentiates them from adjacent soft tissues. It also distends the joint for better separation and visualization of structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the joint space is entered with a needle. Synovial fluid may be aspirated for diagnostic purposes. Next, a contrast agent, such as iodinated contrast, is typically injected. Additionally, medication (eg, anesthetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glucocorticoid) can be injected into the joint for therapeutic purposes as part of an arthrographic procedure.</p><p>Arthrography facilitates identification of intra-articular (&quot;loose&quot;) bodies, certain ligament or tendon injuries, synovial or cartilage abnormalities, sinus tracts, and loosening of joint prostheses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. During the fluoroscopic portion of the examination, &quot;real-time&quot; tracking of contrast as it passes into and fills the joint can highlight abnormalities such as synovitis or abnormal contrast leakage. Arthrography can also be followed by computed tomography (CT) (CT arthrography) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (MR arthrography, using a dilute gadolinium solution) for imaging. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'MR arthrography'</a> below.)</p><p>Complications of arthrography are few, with the most common being synovial irritation (chemical synovitis) induced by the iodinated contrast agent, urticaria, and vasovagal reaction. Infection is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional tomography uses reciprocal motion of the radiograph source and film about a fulcrum. This technique been replaced by computed tomography (CT).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3286450566\"><span class=\"h2\">Tomosynthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tomosynthesis produces three-dimensional images by using several low-dose radiographs obtained at different angles. This technique, which has been used more commonly for breast imaging, has been applied to musculoskeletal problems including evaluation of fractures, hip prostheses, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. A comparison of radiography, tomosynthesis, and MRI for the detection of erosion in a group of 20 consecutive patients with established RA found significantly more erosions with tomosynthesis and MRI than with radiography. Tomosynthesis was comparable to MRI with a sensitivity and specificity of 94.8 percent and 97.8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The radiation dose of tomosynthesis is lower than that of CT, and only slightly higher than that of radiography. A study comparing tomosynthesis with CT for the detection of erosions in the feet of RA patients reported a sensitivity and specificity for tomosynthesis of 80 and 75 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Another study which evaluated tomosynthesis for the detection of hand and wrist erosions in RA patients found a sensitivity and specificity of 77.6 and 89.9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, significantly more erosions were found with CT when compared with tomosynthesis, and significantly more erosions were found with tomosynthesis when compared with radiography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) has become an important diagnostic aid in the evaluation of the musculoskeletal system. As examples, CT is extremely useful in detecting radiographically occult fractures of the acetabulum, cervical spine, wrist, and foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is helpful in evaluating cortical destruction by metastatic lesions that may predispose to pathologic fracture. Ossific or calcific densities within a joint can be seen. Additionally, gas in soft tissues associated with necrotizing fasciitis can be detected, and newer techniques allow orthopedic hardware to be evaluated.</p><p>In CT utilizing a rotating radiograph source in the axial plane, attenuation values are processed by a computer to produce a cross-sectional image. Post-acquisition data processing allows for far greater latitude concerning image display compared with radiography. Equipment with a single linear array of detectors or with a two-dimensional array of multiple detectors (multidetector CT [MDCT]) may be used.</p><p>Helical CT involves continuous patient translation through the gantry at a constant rate during radiograph source rotation and data acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A volume set of data is, therefore, obtained in a relatively short period of time, often in a single breath hold. Helical CT results in decreased artifacts due to motion and respiratory misregistration. It also provides the capability for applications such as CT angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>MDCT allows thin sections to be obtained in shorter scan times. MDCT scanners using wide two&#8208;dimensional&#8233;array detectors&#8233;allow large anatomical volumes to be imaged and reconstructed into thin overlapping sections in just a few seconds, facilitating oblique, multiplanar, and three-dimensional reconstructions.</p><p>Air-filled spaces, fatty tissue, muscle, and cortical and cancellous bone may all be evaluated with a single CT acquisition. Images may be displayed to best demonstrate soft tissues or bones. In contrast to radiography, complicated bony structures and complex pathological processes are displayed with clarity and without being obscured by superimposed structures.</p><p>Manipulation of the imaging data allows high-quality multiplanar reformations and three-dimensional displays to be created at a workstation. This is particularly useful in evaluating skeletal trauma, guiding surgical planning, and identifying relationships between structures and between fracture fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Although the absolute resolution of CT is less than that of radiography, CT is superior in resolving subtle cortical disease. Small cortical or subchondral fractures and osteochondral intra-articular bodies are better seen on CT than on radiographs. CT has also been used to detect and calculate the volume of erosions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], and may be more accurate than MRI or ultrasound for the detection of bone erosions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>CT imaging also has benefits for certain indications compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As an example, soft tissue calcifications and bony abnormalities are better characterized with CT, although MRI is superior for soft tissue contrast. Osteoid osteomas are usually better demonstrated on CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-bone-tumors-in-children-and-adolescents#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign bone tumors in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Osteoid osteoma'</a>). The CT exam requires less time and tends to be less alarming to claustrophobic patients. Also, the presence of metallic implants or pacemakers and the use of life-support equipment do not preclude the use of CT, whereas some of these devices are contraindications to MRI. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications to MRI'</a> below.)</p><p>Technical advances and advanced image reconstruction methods have reduced the artifacts produced by metallic implants, so bone and soft tissue near hardware can be examined more easily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In one series, retrospective evaluation of multidetector CT (MDCT) scanning for determining the presence of orthopedic hardware complications was performed in 109 patients (114 studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Clinical or operative follow-up in 80 percent of cases provided the reference standard. The sensitivity and specificity of this imaging technique for detecting orthopedic hardware complications in patients with follow-up were 74 and 95 percent, respectively. CT was considerably better than radiography for the detection of these complications.</p><p>CT is frequently utilized for the purposes of guiding bone and soft tissue biopsy and aspiration procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Dual-energy CT (DECT), in which an area is scanned at two different energies (eg, 80 and 140 kVp), can be used to differentiate materials with similar CT numbers (related to the linear attenuation coefficient) such as iodine and bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Multiple techniques have been developed for acquiring dual-energy data. DECT can detect tophi and distinguish them from pseudogout and other soft tissue masses. Pooled DECT sensitivity and specificity of 11 studies with a mean duration of gout of seven years were 0.87 (0.79 to 0.93) and 0.84 (0.75 to 0.90), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A prospective assessment of 40 patients with gout (mean duration 13 years, 88 percent of whom were on uric acid-lowering therapy) showed a sensitivity of 78 and 84 percent (depending on inclusion criteria) and a specificity of 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The software algorithm used can significantly affect the positivity for urate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The volume of tophi and subclinical tophi can be assessed using this method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3117318669\"><span class=\"h2\">Considerations for use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to carefully review the indications for each CT examination and minimize the radiation dose as much as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], particularly in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>CT arthrography may be a substitute for patients who cannot have an MRI examination. CT arthrography of the knee, for example, may be used in patients with suspected internal derangement who cannot have MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicts internal structures based upon their chemical composition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The principle of MRI is that, when a patient is placed in the bore of a super conducting electromagnet, free hydrogen nuclei within the tissues will align their inherent magnetic dipoles with that of the magnetic field. This creates a new atomic low-energy state. Rapid pulses of radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation are then imparted to the tissues, which deflect the spinning nuclei off their axes, creating a higher-energy state. As the nuclei return to their baseline state, they emit electromagnetic energy that varies in intensity based upon chemical composition. The energy released by the nuclei relaxing to their baseline energy level can be localized in space and can be quantified, and a cross-sectional image of the area can be produced. A more detailed discussion of MRI is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical MRI systems are available in several field strengths, usually ranging from 0.5 to 3 Tesla. Some advantages of higher field strength are increased signal to noise (providing higher spatial resolution), shorter image acquisition times, and improved imaging after intravenous contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Whole body open-magnet systems provide greater ease in patient positioning, can be used for larger patients, and decrease claustrophobia. However, these magnets are often low- or mid-field with limited signal to noise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Extremity magnets are often low-field magnets that are primarily designed for imaging of peripheral joints. Claustrophobia is avoided since only the part to be examined is placed within the magnet's bore. The use of low-field extremity magnets for imaging rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been a topic of ongoing discussion, especially since these magnets are small enough to be located in an office or clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Extremity MRI is more sensitive than radiography for the detection of joint erosions. This was illustrated in a study of 44 patients that revealed four times more erosions with extremity MRI than with radiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. The authors of the study proposed that MRI of both hands could be used as a screening tool and that examining one hand could be used to monitor erosions over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1767652257\"><span class=\"h2\">Uses of MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major advantage of MRI is its ability to evaluate noncalcified body tissues. For example, menisci, articular cartilage, cruciate ligaments, tendons, and joint fluid that would be indistinguishable on a radiograph are readily distinguished on MRI. Thus, MRI is particularly useful for the evaluation of soft tissue changes such as internal derangement, articular cartilage integrity, and synovitis. An infinite number of reconstruction planes allow for the sagittal, coronal, and axial displays of these complex structures. Normal tendons are completely black (low signal) on traditional MRI sequences. Tendons in early stages of degeneration demonstrate abnormal (increased) signal and contour alterations, and complete disruptions are often readily identified.</p><p>MRI is also very sensitive in detecting subtle changes in the water content of tissues due to inflammation, neoplasm, trauma, or ischemia. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of magnetic resonance imaging&quot;</a>) Changes within the medullary canal of bone alter the normal marrow signal and are depicted with great clarity by MRI. Thus, conditions such as avascular necrosis, transient regional osteoporosis, early infections, subtle trauma, ischemia, and infiltrative processes are best visualized using MRI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications to MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each patient must be evaluated for both indications and contraindications to MRI.

With the use of special instrumentation, it has been found that MRI guidance is feasible for biopsies, spine procedures, cyst aspirations, therapeutic injections, and tumor ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. As MRI becomes increasingly available, it is likely that it will also become increasingly used for these purposes. By combining fluoroscopy with MRI to form hybrid systems, the advantages of each system can be utilized in a synergistic way [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">MR arthrography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of a dilute solution of gadolinium into a joint, followed by MRI, produces an MR arthrogram that allows the intraarticular structures (such as cartilage surfaces) to be better-defined and increases the ability to detect adjacent ligamentous or tendinous disruptions. MR arthrography is often used in evaluating the shoulder and the hip for labral tears. The gadolinium contrast agents that are available for use have generally not been explicitly approved for intra-articular injection by regulatory agencies in the US and Europe; thus, such use is &quot;off-label&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Indirect MR arthrography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After intravenous administration, gadolinium contrast material will diffuse into joints, even normal ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Scintigraphic images are produced following the administration of a radiopharmaceutical. The radiopharmaceutical distributes in the body based upon its chemical and biological properties. Radiation, mostly gamma photons, emitted from the agent is converted into planar or tomographic images. The unique aspect of scintigraphy is that radiotracer localization reflects molecular, metabolic, biochemical, physiologic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pathologic conditions of the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].</p><p>A number of nuclear imaging examinations have been used for evaluation of joint pain, including bone scan, labeled leukocyte scintigraphy (white blood cell [WBC] scan), gallium scan, and positron emission tomography (PET), which is performed with 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) or fluorine-18 sodium fluoride (NaF). The type of scan depends upon the clinical indication.

Technetium-99m (Tc-99m)-labeled diphosphonate, in the form of either methylene diphosphonate (MDP) or hydroxymethylene diphosphonate (HDP), is the most widely used bone scan tracer. Diphosphonate is adsorbed onto the surface of hydroxyapatite crystals. Increased bone uptake of this tracer mostly reflects increased bone turnover or remodeling in response to underlying processes (eg, infection, neoplasms, trauma, arthritis, etc). In the acute phase of infection or inflammation, increased tracer uptake is also due, in part, to increased blood flow, while the contribution of blood flow to bone uptake in chronic conditions is substantially less. Thus, greater acuity and severity of an inflammatory process generally results in findings of more increased blood flow and blood pool activity on the three-phase bone scan. However, the intensity on the delayed phase of the scan does not necessarily reflect the degree of inflammatory activity.</p><p>Bone scan is a highly sensitive technique for the detection of any of a large variety of bone, joint, and periarticular disorders, including fracture, infection, tumor, arthritis, and metabolic bone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]; thus, a negative study effectively excludes most bone and joint abnormalities.

Additionally, there are numerous patterns of periprosthetic uptake associated with asymptomatic prostheses.

In patients with joint replacements, there is often reconversion of yellow marrow to red marrow. As labeled WBCs accumulate both in sites of infection and in red bone marrow, increased WBC uptake around joint replacements is, thus, not specific for infection. Distinguishing these two processes can be done by performing complementary WBC scanning and bone marrow imaging with Tc-99m-sulfur colloid.

Generally, three sets of images, ie, PET images, CT images, and co-registered <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> images, are displayed on a viewing station. Metabolic activity of the area of interest is assessed both by visual inspection of the images and by measuring a semiquantitative value of FDG uptake, called standardized uptake value (SUV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>The most common clinical application of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is in oncology (eg, for differentiating benign from malignant lesions, staging known malignancies, monitoring the effect of therapy on known malignancies, restaging, and detecting tumor recurrence), followed by cardiology (eg, evaluation of ischemia, viability) and neurology (eg, differential diagnosis of dementia, Parkinson syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. While PET is not routinely used in the clinical evaluation of arthritis, it has been employed in the research setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H775600399\"><span class=\"h3\">FDG-PET in rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the FDG-PET studies showing increased FDG uptake in active RA were reported first in 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>], many researchers have examined the utility of FDG-PET in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/105-112\" class=\"abstract_t\">105-112</a>]. Although <span class=\"nowrap\">FDG-PET/CT</span> is not routinely used in patients with RA in the United States, data suggest that it may be helpful in the management of RA, especially in early diagnosis as well as in early prediction and assessment of response to treatment.</p><p>Whole-body evaluation with <span class=\"nowrap\">FDG-PET/CT</span> can detect the extent of disease activity, even at subclinical levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. The sensitivity of FDG PET for detecting inflamed joints in patients with RA is reported to be high (up to 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. While healthy joints do not show abnormally increased FDG uptake, the presence of increased FDG uptake alone does not necessarily differentiate RA from other joint diseases such as OA or other inflammatory joint diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109</a>]. However, biodistribution patterns of involved joints can be used to help distinguish among joint diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].</p><p>Several studies have also shown a correlation between FDG uptake and other parameters of inflammation such as pannus formation on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">painful/swollen</span> joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>], and acute phase reactants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. In addition, early changes in FDG uptake in RA may predict clinical outcomes, as several reports have found that the changes in FDG uptake in the inflamed joint correlate well with the clinical response assessed at various time points following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint/abstract/105,110-112\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,110-112</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2850132314\"><span class=\"h3\">FDG-PET/CT in prosthetic joint infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">FDG-PET/CT</span> is highly sensitive for the inflamed prosthetic joint.

Musculoskeletal US can be used to assess soft tissues, cartilage, bone surfaces, and fluid-containing structures and is becoming more widely available for diagnostic and therapeutic use in outpatient settings. US can be used clinically for assessing and monitoring inflammatory arthritis, for imaging tendons and bursae, and for guiding the aspiration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> injection of joints or soft tissues.</p><p>Among the possible advantages of US are the avoidance of the radiation exposure and of the inconvenience associated with use of fluoroscopy for procedures involving otherwise difficult-to-enter joints and other spaces. Limitations of US include poor soft tissue penetration of sound waves and their complete reflection by bone, resulting in limited acoustic windows for imaging joint pathology, as well as the substantial operator-dependence of US examination.</p><p>The clinical applications of musculoskeletal US, the technical aspects of musculoskeletal US, and the use of US imaging for joint, tendon, and bursal injections and for aspiration of fluid are addressed in detail separately.
