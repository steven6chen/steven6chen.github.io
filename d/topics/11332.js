Certain things make canker sores more likely to develop. These include certain foods, infections, and biting the tongue or inside of the cheek.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mouth cancer (also called &quot;oral cancer&quot;) &ndash; Mouth cancer can cause sores or growths inside the mouth or on the lips or tongue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50104\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50104 \">picture 2</a>). Mouth cancer can also cause the inside of the mouth, lips, or tongue to turn pale or dark. Usually, these symptoms are not painful at first. Some people find out they have mouth cancer only after a routine medical or dental exam.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukoplakia &ndash; This condition causes white or gray patches inside the mouth or on the tongue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F62948\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62948 \">picture 3</a>). These patches can be thick and usually develop over time. This condition can happen after something irritates the inside of the mouth. Smoking or chewing tobacco can also cause leukoplakia. Leukoplakia can sometimes turn into mouth cancer after a few years, but this is uncommon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cheilitis &ndash; Cheilitis is a condition that makes the lips look &quot;chapped&quot; and get red and scaly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77776\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77776 \">picture 4</a>). A few things can cause cheilitis, including windburn, licking the lips a lot, and certain medicines and foods. There is more than one type of cheilitis. &quot;Actinic&quot; cheilitis is caused by too much sun and can later turn into lip cancer. &quot;Angular&quot; cheilitis is caused by an infection, and usually happens in older people whose dentures don't fit well. It causes redness and cracking in the corners of the mouth.</p><p/><p>Besides mouth sores, people can also get dark spots inside their mouth. In people with dark-colored skin, dark spots are usually normal. But in people with light-colored skin, dark spots can be a sign of a serious problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23373458\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see the doctor, dentist, or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See your doctor, dentist, or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a growth in your mouth, or on your tongue or lips.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a patch of dry, scaly skin on your lips that doesn't heal.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a white patch in your mouth or on your tongue.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a dark spot in your mouth, and have light-colored skin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms last longer than 2 weeks, or heal and then come back.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have mouth pain, or trouble eating, swallowing, or talking.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your dentures don't fit well.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23373473\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. The doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. He or she might also do a test called a biopsy. For this test, the doctor will take a tiny sample of the sore, growth, or area of color change. Then another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23373488\"><span class=\"h1\">How are mouth sores treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the cause of your symptoms and whether they bother you.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Canker sores</strong> usually get better by themselves within a few weeks. To help with pain, you can use an over-the-counter medicine made to soothe canker sores. You can also avoid eating or drinking hot and spicy foods. If your symptoms are severe, your doctor might prescribe a mouthwash or medicine to use on the area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mouth cancer</strong> is usually treated with one or more of the following treatments:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Leukoplakia</strong> is sometimes treated with surgery to remove the abnormal patches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for <strong>cheilitis</strong> depends on the type of cheilitis. Your doctor might recommend that you use petroleum jelly (brand name: Vaseline) on the area. If you have an infection, he or she will prescribe an ointment with a medicine in it for you to use on the area. If poorly-fitting dentures caused your infection, you should ask your dentist to fix them.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23373595\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-sores-oral-herpes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cold sores (oral herpes) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tongue-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tongue cancer (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
