Imaging may also be needed for patients who have received antibiotics prior to evaluation. Ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT), separately or in combination, are the modalities used most frequently although magnetic resonance imaging has similar diagnostic accuracy as CT. (See <a href=\"#H4189074\" class=\"local\">'Imaging approach'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6656915\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical suspicion'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High clinical likelihood of appendicitis</strong> &ndash; We suggest that children with a high likelihood of appendicitis based upon clinical findings undergo evaluation by a surgeon with pediatric expertise prior to urgent imaging studies.

Clinicians managing children with suspected appendicitis in such facilities, whenever possible, should <strong>avoid</strong> diagnostic imaging and instead transfer the patient to a center with pediatric radiology and pediatric general surgery capabilities.</p><p/><p>A systematic institutional approach to the choice of imaging is associated with improved outcomes including increased diagnosis of appendicitis at initial presentation, reduced radiation exposure, decreased negative appendectomy rate, and no increase in perforation rate. (See <a href=\"#H82558898\" class=\"local\">'Clinical protocols'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinical scoring systems have the potential to help with decisions regarding diagnostic imaging and limit the use of imaging in children with a low risk of appendicitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6659516\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical scoring systems'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4189074\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We and the American College of Radiology recommend that imaging in children with atypical or equivocal clinical findings for appendicitis begin with ultrasonography (US) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. If the appendix is not visualized or the findings on US are otherwise not diagnostic, the patient may either be observed with serial physical examinations and repeated imaging (US, computed tomography [CT], or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) performed at a later time. If a clinical diagnosis of appendicitis cannot be made or, if more prompt diagnosis is desired, the patient may directly proceed to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22931363\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients whose initial ultrasound is equivocal for the diagnosis of appendicitis, repeat physical examination and a second ultrasound in patients who have persistent findings of appendicitis has good diagnostic accuracy and can markedly reduce the number of children undergoing CT. As an example, in a prospective observational study of 294 children undergoing acute evaluation for abdominal pain (38 percent with appendicitis), a pathway that utilized serial physical examination, surgical consultation, and repeat ultrasound for patients whose initial ultrasound was equivocal; discharge for patients whose initial ultrasound showed a normal appendix, and surgical consultation for patients with initial ultrasounds that were positive for appendicitis achieved a sensitivity of 97 percent and a specificity of 91 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. CT was performed in four patients.</p><p>Use of MRI instead of CT is limited to pediatric specialty centers because of issues related to cost, availability, limited experience with interpretation, and the potential need for sedation in younger children. (See <a href=\"#H22931363\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'</a> below.)</p><p>Ultrasound for initial diagnostic imaging in obese children may avoid the need for CT in a large proportion of these patients. As an example, in a small observational study that evaluated outcomes for 76 obese children undergoing US for suspected appendicitis, appendicitis was confirmed by US alone in 23 of 26 patients and was excluded in 42 of 50 patients without the use of CT imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, given the technical limitations of ultrasound in diagnosing appendicitis in very obese children, some clinicians may choose to perform contrast CT or MRI as the initial imaging strategy in these patients.</p><p>If a CT is performed, we use intravenous contrast alone and begin the evaluation with a focused examination and expand the study to include the entire abdomen if an abnormality is seen on the uppermost image. When reviewing the images, coronal reformatted images increase the level of confidence in identification of the normal and abnormal appendix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Contrast'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Focused CT'</a> below.)</p><p>In the United States, increased use of ultrasound alone or ultrasound with CT in children&rsquo;s hospitals has been associated with lower rates of negative appendectomy without an increase in appendiceal rupture or patients returning with a new diagnosis of appendicitis within two weeks of initial emergency department visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>In Israel, increased use of US for diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the emergency department significantly decreased pediatric hospital admissions without any instance of missed appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In settings with adequate experience in interpreting MRI for the presence of appendicitis and with the resources to rapidly obtain and interpret the study, MRI may be preferable to CT. Evidence suggests that the use of MRI is associated with similar diagnostic accuracy and negative appendectomy rates. (See <a href=\"#H22931363\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'</a> below.)</p><p>While we encourage radiology departments to develop expertise in US for children, we recognize that the availability of such expertise may be limited in some locations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASONOGRAPHY (US)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>US is available in most institutions, is relatively inexpensive, and is safe. It has the added advantage of identifying ovarian pathology, such as torsion or an ovarian cyst. However, accuracy depends upon the skill and experience of the sonographer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4189194\"><span class=\"h2\">Test performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>US improves diagnostic accuracy in selected children with suspected appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. When the appendix is visualized the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound is equivalent to computed tomography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As an example, in a multicenter study of 965 children undergoing abdominal ultrasound for possible appendicitis, sensitivity and specificity were 98 and 92 percent, respectively, in the 469 patients in whom the appendix was clearly seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>However, the diagnosis of appendicitis <strong>cannot</strong> be reliably excluded by US unless a normal appendix is seen. Reported visualization rates vary from 22 to 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Factors that affect this variability primarily include the experience and technique of the sonographer, as well as the child&rsquo;s body habitus.</p><p>In pediatric patients, overall sensitivities of US performed by pediatric ultrasound technicians <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pediatric radiologists for appendicitis, including studies in which the appendix was not visualized, have varied from 74 to 100 percent and specificities have ranged from 88 to 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/10,12-14,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12-14,16-20</a>]. Factors that increase the diagnostic accuracy of US in children include operator experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], longer duration of abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and incorporation of specific thresholds for white blood cell count and proportion of polymorphonuclear cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] or white blood cell count alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In certain situations, primarily children with a high body mass index or in whom the likelihood of appendicitis based upon clinical findings is low, US can result in a significant number of false-positive and false-negative results. For example, in an observational study of 263 children, 4 to 17 years of age, with suspected appendicitis, US was inaccurate in 101 examinations (88 false-positive findings, 13 false-negative findings) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Inaccurate examinations were significantly associated with high body mass index (&ge;85<sup>th</sup> percentile, primarily false-negative results) or low pretest clinical suspicion for appendicitis (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5 and OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-4.0, respectively, primarily false-positive results). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pitfalls and limitations of US'</a> below.)</p><p>Preliminary evidence suggests that emergency physicians with proper training and experience in performing bedside ultrasonography for appendicitis can achieve reasonable diagnostic accuracy. As an example, in a prospective observational study of bedside ultrasonography by pediatric emergency medicine physicians in 231 patients (264 studies), sensitivity for appendicitis was 85 percent and specificity was 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, in this study, a large proportion of ultrasound tests were performed by one physician with extensive experience. Thus, the accuracy of bedside ultrasound for appendicitis in children is operator dependent and requires a rigorous scanning protocol that results in consistent visualization of the appendix.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following techniques may improve visualization of the appendix and permit more accurate diagnosis of appendicitis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posterior compression</strong> &ndash; The addition of posterior manual compression to graded compression can help to identify the appendix. This was demonstrated in a report of 570 consecutive patients referred for suspected appendicitis, 28 percent of whom were less than 16 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Visualization of the appendix increased from 85 to 95 percent with posterior manual compression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positional scanning</strong> &ndash; Scanning in the flank and pelvis, in addition to the right lower quadrant, may be useful. Among 199 children with appendicitis, scanning of the retrocecal area using a posterolateral approach, followed by scanning of the pelvis through a full urinary bladder, and scanning of the right lower quadrant resulted in identification of 68 percent of abnormal appendices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The combination of noncompressive and compressive techniques increased the identification rate to 96 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pitfalls and limitations of US</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of difficulties with the use of ultrasound for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fat absorbs and diffuses the ultrasound beam making it more difficult to scan overweight children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can be difficult to identify a normal appendix or one that is only focally inflamed (&quot;tip&quot; appendicitis).

How often this occurs is unknown. Consequently, clinical correlation and imaging with enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be required to exclude the diagnosis of appendicitis, even with a normal US examination.</p><p>Diagnoses that can mimic appendicitis on US include lymphoma, Crohn's disease, and cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, we have seen some false-positive ultrasound reports where the diagnosis of appendicitis was based upon increased appendiceal wall thickness alone. We recommend caution in utilizing ultrasound reports as the sole criterion for diagnosis of appendicitis without other supportive clinical findings.</p><p>In our practice, visualization of a normal appendix constitutes a normal US examination. When the appendix is not visualized in an otherwise unremarkable pelvic examination, we report the study as showing no evidence of appendicitis. Further imaging is determined by the requesting clinician. If further imaging is desired, we typically perform contrast enhanced CT. In other institutions, MRI without contrast may be substituted for CT. (See <a href=\"#H22931363\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enhanced CT is a commonly used imaging modality for testing of children with possible appendicitis who have nondiagnostic findings on ultrasound although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used in some institutions instead of CT in older children (eg, older than six years of age) who can cooperate with the examination. (See <a href=\"#H22931363\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'</a> below.)</p><p>CT is typically more available and less operator dependent than ultrasonography. CT is also useful in establishing alternative diagnoses for abdominal pain. As an example, in one observational study of 125 children examined with focused CT that was negative for possible appendicitis, 62 had alternative diagnoses made including ileitis or colitis suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease, mesenteric adenitis, and intact or ruptured ovarian cyst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19883812\"><span class=\"h2\">Test performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, sensitivity for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis by CT ranges between 94 and 100 percent. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/13,18,21,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18,21,28-30</a>]. Reported specificity is 93 to 100 percent. In one large observational study of 1810 children with suspected appendicitis, CT had high sensitivity and specificity regardless of the duration of abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>CT has the disadvantage of exposure to ionizing radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. In addition, some children have a paucity of mesenteric fat, which makes visualization of either a normal or an inflamed appendix more difficult, especially on an unenhanced CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Increased utilization of CT and improved accuracy of imaging for acute appendicitis have not contributed substantially to lower rates of negative appendectomy since the mid-1990s, and the perforation rate remains as high as 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. This finding has raised concerns regarding increased exposure to ionizing radiation, healthcare costs, and delay in surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/31,32,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,38,39</a>]. Limited evidence suggests that protocols emphasizing early surgical evaluation, selective imaging that emphasizes ultrasonography, and careful serial examination for patients with equivocal radiographic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical findings can achieve lower rates for negative appendectomy and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/38,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40-42</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H82558898\" class=\"local\">'Clinical protocols'</a> below.)</p><p>The benefit of CT for appendicitis in children may also vary according to patient age and gender. As an example, in a multicenter observational study of 55,227 children undergoing appendectomy, children younger than five years of age who underwent CT had a clinically significant reduction in the negative appendectomy rate (NAR) when compared to children who did not receive a CT (NAR 5 versus 22 percent, respectively, for boys [OR 0.18], NAR 2 versus 18 percent, respectively, for girls [OR 0.11]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Among boys five years of age and older who underwent appendectomy, the NAR was 1 percent and was not significantly different for those boys who had advanced diagnostic imaging (ultrasound, CT, or both). Diagnostic imaging also did not greatly impact the NAR in girls, although girls older than 10 years of age had a higher NAR than either boys or girls 5 to 10 years old. Thus, CT was associated with the greatest reduction in the NAR among young children (&lt;5 years of age).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Techniques to improve the accuracy and safety of CT include the use of intravenous contrast, limiting the examination to a focused CT of the pelvic contents, and adjusting scanning parameters to achieve the lowest radiation dose possible while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Enteral contrast (rectal or oral) does not appear to improve diagnostic imaging over the use of intravenous contrast alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Contrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend that children with suspected appendicitis and nondiagnostic findings on ultrasound who proceed directly to CT undergo contrast-enhanced CT with intravenous contrast rather than no contrast. In addition, we recommend that children with suspected appendicitis undergo contrast-enhanced CT with intravenous contrast alone rather than intravenous contrast combined with enteral (oral or rectal) contrast.</p><p>Intravenous contrast is helpful in identifying the appendix and adjacent structures, particularly in children under the age of 10 years who generally have limited mesenteric fat. For example, in 306 children with suspected appendicitis who underwent both unenhanced helical CT of the lower abdomen and intravenous contrast-enhanced CT of the entire abdomen, contrast-enhanced CT had a significantly higher pooled sensitivity for appendicitis than unenhanced CT (90 versus 66 percent, respectively) with similar specificity (94 versus 96 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19883812\" class=\"local\">'Test performance'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, if a child with suspected appendicitis has equivocal or negative findings on an unenhanced CT, then frequently the study is repeated with contrast, thus increasing radiation exposure.</p><p>Contrast has also been given enterally (rectal or oral), to opacify and distend the cecum in an attempt to improve visualization of the inflamed appendiceal wall or mesentery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/13,30,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,30,45</a>]. However, observational studies suggest that rectal or oral contrast does not further improve test performance over intravenous contrast CT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19883812\" class=\"local\">'Test performance'</a> above.)</p><p>Furthermore, enteral contrast administration presents several challenges. Rectal contrast administration is uncomfortable, difficult to administer in patients with diarrhea, and contraindicated in patients with intestinal perforation. Oral contrast delays scanning for approximately two hours, does not appear in the terminal ileum in up to 30 percent of patients at the time of CT scan, and may require nasogastric tube placement for proper administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Intravenous contrast can cause hypersensitivity reactions, chemotoxicity, and renal failure. However, these reactions are rare in children. The risk of contrast-induced immediate hypersensitivity can be reduced by using low osmolal contrast material agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodixanol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">iodixanol</a> [Visipaque]) and in children with asthma, ensuring control of symptoms before the procedure.

Some experts advocate scanning from the bottom of the third lumbar vertebral body to the pubic ramus. The scan can be expanded to include the upper abdomen if an abnormality is found on the initial uppermost image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Support for this approach was demonstrated in a retrospective review of 93 abdominal CT scans obtained with oral and IV contrast in children with suspected appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. All of the abnormal findings leading to a diagnosis of appendicitis were located below the lower pole of the right kidney (RLP).

Weight-based reductions in tube current have been recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Radiation dose can also be significantly reduced by increasing pitch. In addition, iterative reconstruction techniques have been shown to reduce radiation dosage by 45 to 46 percent compared with traditional weight-based protocols while maintaining diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Awareness of these recommendations may not be widespread, however.

For example in a metaanalysis of eight studies that evaluated diagnostic accuracy of MRI for appendicitis in children, the pooled sensitivity was 96 percent (95% CI: 95 to 97 percent) and the pooled specificity was 96 percent (95% CI: 94 to 98 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. A separate metaanalysis of 11 studies had similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

In three of the studies included in the metaanalysis, imaging time was reported with median or mean imaging times &lt;20 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>].

Negative appendectomy rates were low in both groups (1.4 to 2.5 percent). Time to antibiotics or operation was not different between the groups. However, the time to definitive imaging (CT or MRI) was long for both modalities (7 to 11 hours for CT and 9 to 13 hours for MRI).</p><p>Taken together, these studies suggest that MRI with or without contrast may be a suitable alternative to CT in children with suspected appendicitis when it can be obtained in a timely fashion and properly interpreted.

Both ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) are valuable modalities for imaging in children with suspected appendicitis. Evidence also suggests a role for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients who can cooperate with the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The choice of study in any given clinical situation depends upon patient characteristics, such as obesity and gender, and institutional resources, such as the availability of US, CT, or MRI and the expertise of the staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Of note, clinicians may be reluctant to use a protocol that includes modalities that are frequently unavailable or cannot be interpreted with confidence.</p><p>Imaging protocols for the diagnosis of appendicitis in children can result in a significant decrease in radiation exposure without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy or clinical outcomes. Observational studies that have evaluated outcomes before and after implementation of imaging protocols show decreased CT utilization of approximately 50 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>]. These protocols emphasize the use of clinical scoring systems, ultrasound as the initial diagnostic imaging test, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical evaluation by a surgeon to guide patient management decisions. Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of appendicitis was high in two of these studies (sensitivity 98.6 to 99 percent, specificity 91 to 94 percent) without an increase in negative appendectomies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/65,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,67</a>]. In one study, missed appendicitis after protocol implementation was 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. When MRI was used instead of CT, sensitivity and specificity was also high (100 percent and 99 percent, respectively) with a negative appendectomy rate of 1.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-children-diagnostic-imaging/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>However, even in settings where multidisciplinary protocols have been developed, achieving high rates of compliance can be difficult.
