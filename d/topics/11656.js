Patients who are candidates for neuraxial anesthesia techniques may be on chronic antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy, may require anticoagulation during or following surgery, or may receive prophylactic medication for venous thromboembolism in the perioperative period. These patients are at increased risk for hemorrhagic complications of neuraxial techniques.</p><p>For the purpose of this topic, neuraxial anesthesia refers to spinal or epidural anesthesia procedures that may be performed for surgical anesthesia or perioperative analgesia. This topic will discuss the level of risk, the management of antithrombotic (anticoagulant and antiplatelet) medication in conjunction with neuraxial anesthesia, and the timing of neuraxial anesthesia relative to antithrombotic medication in non-pregnant patients. Neuraxial procedures in obstetrical patients and patients being treated for chronic pain are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse effects of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia for obstetrics&quot;</a>.). In-depth discussion of neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia is also found elsewhere.

While in general the recommendations presented here are applicable to patients having paravertebral and other &quot;deep&quot; blocks (in anatomic locations not amenable to the application of pressure to control hemorrhage), recommendations regarding antithrombotic medication may not be as rigid for more superficial blocks; this is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of peripheral nerve blocks&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity nerve blocks: Techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550476487\"><span class=\"h1\">PROBLEM OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding is the major complication of antithrombotic therapy. When this bleeding occurs in the closed space of the spinal canal, the expanding hematoma causes increased pressure on the spinal cord or cauda equina, which in turn may lead to spinal cord ischemia and infarction.</p><p>Following neuraxial anesthesia (spinal or epidural), bleeding is most commonly from vessels in the prominent venous plexus of the epidural space, although it can be in the subdural or subarachnoid spaces. We will refer to this bleeding as spinal epidural hematoma (SEH); the considerations discussed below do not differ for other bleeding locations within the spinal canal.</p><p>The risk of SEH related to neuraxial anesthesia is greatest when a patient's coagulation system is abnormal either at the time a needle is placed in the neuraxial space or at the time of removal of a continuous neuraxial catheter. In all patients on medication affecting hemostasis, the timing of neuraxial anesthesia must be coordinated with discontinuation and resumption of these medications to minimize the risk of significant bleeding from disrupted epidural blood vessels.</p><p>There are numerous reasons for patients to be on antithrombotic medication, either on a chronic basis or episodically. The specific medication and the timing of the last dose are critical pieces of information for the anesthesiologist planning neuraxial procedures. <strong>Patients receiving more than one medication affecting hemostasis should generally not receive neuraxial <span class=\"nowrap\">anesthesia/analgesia</span>.</strong> (See <a href=\"#H703631051\" class=\"local\">'Timing of placement and removal of spinal or epidural'</a> below and <a href=\"#H175240444\" class=\"local\">'Multiple antithrombotic drugs'</a> below.)</p><p>SEH is not clinically apparent until pain or neurologic deficits appear. Following neuraxial anesthesia, patients on antithrombotic drugs should undergo careful, scheduled, neurologic assessment for signs of bleeding, so that timely therapy may be initiated should bleeding occur (see <a href=\"#H703630956\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic monitoring'</a> below). SEH may result in permanent neurologic damage, including paralysis, even when surgically decompressed emergently (within eight hours). Prevention is critical because even prompt treatment may not prevent permanent neurological deficit. (See <a href=\"#H703631320\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of neurologic damage from spinal hematoma'</a> below.)</p><p>In the United States, the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) published guidelines for the use of regional anesthesia in patients on antithrombotic medication in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The authors agree with these guidelines and have based their recommendations on them (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87862 \">table 1</a>). Guidelines have been published by several anesthesiology societies in Europe, which are generally similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].

In a retrospective review of all SEHs at a single institution from 1986 to 2001, 7 of the 17 cases were spontaneous; none was related to neuraxial anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703631600\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence after neuraxial anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of SEH following neuraxial anesthesia is unknown, but likely very low, based on retrospective studies with small numbers of hematomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. In a 2004 retrospective study, 25 SEHs occurred after approximately 450,000 epidurals (1 in 18,000), and 8 occurred after 1,260,000 spinals (1 in 158,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The incidence of hemorrhagic complications varied significantly depending on the population, from 1 in 200,000 for obstetrical patients to 1 in 3600 for female knee arthroplasty patients.</p><p>Although a 1993 literature review estimated the incidence was less than 1 in 150,000 for epidurals and less than 1 in 220,000 for spinal anesthetics, these estimates are probably low because the case series included were completed prior to the routine administration of perioperative thromboprophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550476508\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk factors for SEH after neuraxial anesthesia include coagulopathy, timing of antithrombotic drugs in relation to performance of the neuraxial procedure, difficult or traumatic (bloody) placement, spinal abnormalities, female gender, and possibly older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication/abstract/8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 10-year retrospective analysis of 1,710,000 neuraxial anesthetics, 33 SEHs were reported; of those, 11 (33 percent) were in patients with coagulopathy or who had an antithrombotic drug administered in temporal proximity to the block, 10 (30 percent) had difficult placement, and 6 (18 percent) had spine pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Of the patients having single shot spinals for hip fracture (70 percent female), all of the spinal hematomas developed in female patients, reflecting an incidence of 1 in 22,000. Older adult patients appear to carry an increased risk for spinal hematoma following neuraxial blockade, perhaps owing to the higher incidence of spinal abnormalities in this population. Spinal abnormalities (eg, spinal stenosis) may lead to neurologic deficits from a smaller volume bleed (due to the smaller spinal canal and narrowing of the neural foramina) rather than an increased incidence of bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of the literature from 1906 to 1994 including 61 SEHs, 53 (87 percent) were in patients with coagulopathy or administration of an antithrombotic drug in temporal proximity to the block (n = 42) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> difficult needle or catheter placement (n = 30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523716815\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common presenting symptoms of a neurologically-significant SEH were a progressive motor and sensory block (68 percent of patients) or <span class=\"nowrap\">bowel/bladder</span> dysfunction (8 percent); unlike classical disc herniation, radicular pain complaints were not a presenting symptom in patients with spinal hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The decision to use neuraxial anesthesia in patients who either have been or will be receiving antithrombotic medication must weigh the benefit of the neuraxial anesthetic against the risk of spinal epidural hematoma (SEH). There are numerous antithrombotic drugs; risks and recommendations are discussed by class and often differ by drug within the class (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87862\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87862 \">table 1</a>).

When spinal or epidural analgesia is used in conjunction with IV heparin, use of the smallest effective concentrations of local anesthetic will allow for earlier recognition should motor or sensory loss be caused by SEH. If signs and symptoms (numbness, weakness, back pain) of SEH are noted, emergent MRI and appropriate surgical consultation should be obtained, as neurologic recovery is more likely with surgical decompression within eight hours of symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87655279\"><span class=\"h4\">IV UFH bolus during surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular surgery often requires IV administration of UFH (typically 5000 to 10,000 units) prior to clamping large vessels.

When neuraxial needle or catheter placement is traumatic (bloody) or requires multiple attempts, concerns about subsequent anticoagulation should be discussed with the surgeon. Surgery that includes an intravenous bolus of UFH within one hour of the traumatic procedure may be rescheduled to minimize the risk of SEH. In the case of an urgent surgical procedure that requires such heparinization, sensory and motor neurologic function should be closely monitored around the time of expected recovery. Using the lowest effective concentrations of local anesthetic in the postoperative period facilitates monitoring of motor blockade and earlier detection of SEH.
