The treatment of HH will be discussed here. The genetics, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and issues related to screening for HH are discussed separately.

A number of observational studies have indicated that these complications can be minimized, or even avoided, when adequate treatment (ie, phlebotomy) is initiated when this disorder is promptly diagnosed and treated. As an example, with few exceptions, those with HH and HCC do so in the presence of cirrhosis, consistent with observations that treatment of HH prior to the development of cirrhosis has a major impact on overall survival in this disorder. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An early study, reported in 1976, in 85 patients with HH treated with phlebotomy as compared with a historical group of 26 untreated patients, indicated significantly longer five-year (66 versus 18 percent) and 10-year (32 versus 6 percent) overall survivals for the treated group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Of interest, 10 of the 85 treated patients, all of whom had cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis, died of HCC 3 to 15 years later, despite having received treatment with phlebotomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an observational study of 163 patients with HH, survival was similar to that of a normal population in the 51 patients in whom treatment (eg, phlebotomy) was initiated before the development of cirrhosis or diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Further, overall survival was markedly reduced in those patients who could not be depleted of iron during the first 18 months of phlebotomy therapy, as compared with those who could be depleted during this time interval.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another observational study of 128 patients with HH in whom the effect of phlebotomy could be assessed, 66 were adequately treated (median amount of iron removed: 14 g, range: 4.5 to 36 g) while 62 were inadequately treated (median amount of iron removed: 4.4 g, range: 0.25 to 24 g) due to poor patient compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Adequately treated patients had a significantly lower frequency of cirrhosis than inadequately treated patients (68 versus 93 percent, respectively) as well as significantly longer median survival (16 versus 4.5 years, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2169006\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect on disease complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phlebotomy has a variety of benefits, including improvement in or resolution of varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], reduction in the degree of hepatic fibrosis if cirrhosis is absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], reversal of left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], and some reversal of secondary hypogonadism in men (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68740\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68740 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. However, not all patients improve and not all responders have complete recovery, particularly in patients with advanced disease. In a review of 30 patients with HH, cirrhosis, and varices, the varices improved or completely reversed in only 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, hypogonadism typically improves in younger men but may be unlikely to improve in men over the age of 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and isolated reports suggest that some patients with severe cardiomyopathy do not improve with phlebotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Arthritis and diabetes mellitus do not usually improve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arthritis and bone disease associated with hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Despite prior reports to the contrary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], data from the United Network for Organ Sharing, covering all liver transplants performed in the United States between 1997 and 2006, have indicated that the 217 recipients with a diagnosis of hemochromatosis had one-, three- and five-year survivals comparable to all other transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Accordingly, severe liver involvement in patients with HH is not a barrier for successful liver transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Family screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the one available study of first-degree relatives with HH uncovered by family screening, a substantial number had signs and symptoms related to HH that were not yet detected clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This suggests that screening of first-degree relatives is likely to uncover a high percentage of affected individuals, many of whom do not yet have irreversible disease and would be expected to respond favorably to therapeutic phlebotomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Detection in family members'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Population screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients found to have homozygous HH during population screening studies are likely to be asymptomatic and have a normal lifespan even if they do not undergo phlebotomy. This was illustrated in a screening study of over 41,000 individuals from the Kaiser Permanente Clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Among the 152 identified homozygotes for HH (0.4 percent), there was no increase in diabetes, arthropathy, arrhythmias, impotence, and skin pigmentation compared with those without HH and only one patient (0.7 percent of those with HH) had signs and symptoms suggestive of HH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Population screening'</a>.)</p><p>Three relatively long-term studies provide confirmatory evidence of the low rate of symptomatic disease in asymptomatic individuals who are homozygous for HH:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the 23 homozygotes detected in a Danish population study (0.25 percent of the 9174 screened subjects), none had clinically overt HH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although follow-up studies showed modest increases in transferrin saturation and ferritin during 25 years of follow-up, only one developed biochemical signs compatible with subclinical HH, and none required treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 10 previously untreated subjects diagnosed with homozygous HH in 1998, who had clinical and laboratory information going back to 1981, indicated progressively increasing transferrin saturations during the 17-year period before diagnosis, with marked variation in serum ferritin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The one patient in this group who developed cirrhosis also consumed more than six standard alcoholic drinks per day, a major risk factor for worsening liver disease in HH. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of excessive ethanol'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HFE mutations were studied in a long-term prospective cohort involving 31,192 Australian subjects of Northern European descent aged 40 to 69 years who had iron studies performed 12 years apart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The prevalence of HH-associated signs and symptoms at the time of follow-up was similar for the 102 previously undiagnosed C282Y homozygotes and the 291 HFE wild-types for those with normal serum ferritin at baseline (ie, &lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> for men and postmenopausal women and &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> for premenopausal women) as well as for those with &quot;moderately elevated&quot; levels at baseline (ie, above normal but &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span>.</p><p/><p>It has been concluded from these studies that individuals with <strong>asymptomatic</strong> HH and ferritins &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> are at low risk for developing HH-related signs and symptoms in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2686259\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF HH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of HH depends on whether the patient has symptomatic iron overload, iron overload without symptoms, or implicated <em>HFE</em> gene mutations without iron overload. </p><p>The components of an effective treatment program are outlined below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Our approach is consistent with the 2011 Practice Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of HH from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H398341\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients without iron overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, individuals identified by family screening are more likely to have subclinical signs or symptoms of iron overload, whereas asymptomatic individuals with HH and ferritins &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> are at low risk for developing HH-related signs and symptoms in the future. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Population screening'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients without organ damage or iron overload (eg, asymptomatic with ferritin level &le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> and transferrin saturation &le;60 percent), we monitor clinical status on a yearly basis, without performing phlebotomy or iron chelation. Our routine includes physical evaluation of the skin, heart, liver, joints, and endocrine organs (eg, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, diabetes), with yearly determination of the serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation. Additional studies (eg, liver function testing, echocardiography) are done only when disease progression is evident. Phlebotomy is initiated for those who develop iron overload or have progressively increasing ferritin levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transferrin saturation. (See <a href=\"#H16344569\" class=\"local\">'Patients with iron overload'</a> below.) </p><p>This monitoring interval for patients without iron overload is more intensive than some of the recommendations by authors in Denmark and Australia, who monitor asymptomatic C282Y homozygotes who have been identified through population screening as infrequently as once every 10 to 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. The ferritin level we use for initiating phlebotomy is higher than that proposed by a panel of experts who formed the Hemochromatosis Management Working Group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16344569\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with iron overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who have a clinical phenotype consistent with hemochromatosis (regardless of genotype) will benefit from therapeutic phlebotomy. Thus, as initial treatment in symptomatic patients with HH, those with end-organ damage, and those with progressively increasing levels of serum ferritin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transferrin saturation, we recommend the immediate institution of a program of weekly or every other week phlebotomy over no therapy. We perform phlebotomy for individuals with symptomatic HH <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those with ferritin levels &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L,</span> transferrin saturations &gt;60 percent, or evidence of organ iron overload via MRI testing. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Phlebotomy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload#H10044347\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload&quot;, section on 'Determining the extent and severity'</a>.)</p><p>Phlebotomy should not be withheld based upon advanced age alone or in patients who are asymptomatic but have iron studies (or other evidence) consistent with iron overload. </p><p>Possible exceptions to the use of phlebotomy as outlined below include patients who have limited life expectancy due to other diseases, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those who are anemic or otherwise do not tolerate phlebotomy (eg, ferroportin mutations, aceruloplasminemia, heart failure with hemodynamic instability). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Ferroportin mutations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Aceruloplasminemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-chelators-choice-of-agent-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron chelators: Choice of agent, dosing, and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Such patients may instead respond to either a reduced phlebotomy schedule or iron chelation therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5061151\" class=\"local\">'Iron chelation'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to iron removal with phlebotomy (or rarely, chelation), individuals with iron overload should avoid excessive iron absorption, although this should not interfere with general healthy dietary intake. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Dietary limitations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Phlebotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The simplest, cheapest, and most effective way to remove accumulated iron in non-anemic patients with iron overload is via therapeutic phlebotomy. Each 500 mL of whole blood removed contains 200 to 250 mg of iron. In providing replacement for the hemoglobin lost along with the phlebotomized red cells, the body mobilizes an equal amount of iron from tissue stores, thereby reducing the degree of iron overload.</p><p>Thus, for a patient with HH and estimated iron stores of 10 grams, one phlebotomy per week for 50 weeks should fully deplete the patient's accumulated iron stores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic phlebotomy can be performed in a physician's office, blood bank or other hospital facility, or at home by a well-trained phlebotomist. Patients should be encouraged to maintain hydration and avoid vigorous exercise within 24 hours of phlebotomy. Symptoms of hypovolemia are more likely in patients who have a hemoglobin concentration less than 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or a hematocrit less than 33 percent prior to phlebotomy.</p><p>The optimal regimen for phlebotomy in HH has not been established. However, it is preferable that patients be depleted of iron as quickly as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/1,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29</a>]. Removal of one unit of blood every one or two weeks usually suffices, with the exceptions as listed below. A weekly phlebotomy program removing 50 units of blood per year will remove approximately 10 to 12.5 g of iron. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male patients may tolerate removal of 1.5 to 2 units per week, whereas women, older adults, and those with a low body mass (eg, less than 50 kg) or cardiopulmonary disease may only tolerate removal of 0.5 units per week (eg, 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The development of erythroid hyperplasia after a few weeks of phlebotomy often permits a more accelerated phlebotomy schedule.

However, with a less aggressive schedule, these patients can become iron depleted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Ferroportin mutations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The blood withdrawn from a patient with HH can be used for direct transfusion in the United States, provided that the patient otherwise qualifies as a blood donor. US Food and Drug Administration regulations require that the container should be labeled conspicuously to indicate that the donor had hemochromatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Regulations for the use of such blood vary within Europe and its use is explicitly forbidden in Austria, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Two different methods are used by the authors, reflecting general preferences rather than evidence-based approaches.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One author (SLS) and many hematologists maintain weekly phlebotomies until iron deficient hematopoiesis is induced, as evidenced by a hemoglobin concentration of 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> mean cell volume (MCV) in the low 80s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], transferrin saturation of 10 to 20 percent, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) &gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL,</span> and a serum ferritin concentration within the low normal range (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">[mcg/L]</span> in our laboratory). The resulting iron deficiency anemia does not need to be treated, as the increased absorption of food iron seen in HH will reverse the anemia in a few weeks following cessation of phlebotomies, without the need for iron supplements (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second author (BRB) and many hepatologists recommend weekly phlebotomy until iron stores are normalized (defined as a serum ferritin concentration &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">[mcg/L]</span> and transferrin saturation &lt;50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/26,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,35</a>]. It may be necessary to discontinue phlebotomy temporarily if the hemoglobin or hematocrit falls by more than 20 percent from prior values. The induction of iron deficiency is not viewed as necessary.</p><p/><p>Other recommendations have been proposed by consensus panels, including the Hemochromatosis Management Working Group, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, and the European Association for the study of liver (EASL), which are similar to those of our second author, although with some variability in the frequency of phlebotomy, as well as the desired endpoints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57962 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/28,29,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,36,37</a>].</p><p>In the past, it was not uncommon to need 70 to 100 phlebotomies to remove the enormous iron stores in patients who presented with symptoms. However, with earlier diagnosis, 30 phlebotomies or fewer may be sufficient. In a series of 40 newly diagnosed patients who were seen between 1990 and 1995, for example, removal of a mean of 30 units of blood (approximately 7.5 g of iron) was required to normalize body iron stores (defined as a serum ferritin concentration below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and transferrin saturation below 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Maintenance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A maintenance phlebotomy schedule should be continued in patients with HH following primary iron depletion to prevent reaccumulation of iron.

For maintenance, most patients require a 500 mL phlebotomy every two to four months.</p><p>The following example illustrates how rapidly some patients with HH can absorb iron after they have been iron depleted: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patient with HH was extensively phlebotomized until his serum ferritin concentration was less than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> indicating that his iron stores were totally depleted. His hemoglobin concentration at that time was 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> with an MCV of 78. Three months later, the following results were noted: hemoglobin concentration 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> MCV 91; serum ferritin concentration 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> and serum transferrin saturation 48 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The calculation of iron absorption in this patient is as follows. The increase in hemoglobin was 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L;</span> with a total blood volume of 5 liters, the total increase in hemoglobin was 200 g. There are 3.3 mg of iron in each gram of hemoglobin or 660 mg of iron in 200 g of hemoglobin. This quantity of iron (660 mg) must have been absorbed over 90 days, representing a net retention of 7.3 mg of iron per day, or 220 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/month,</span> the latter being the amount of iron present in one unit of whole blood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7188250\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythrocytapheresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythrocytapheresis is an apheresis technique whereby red cells are removed in an isovolemic manner and the patient's plasma is returned to the patient. When employed, with or without the use of erythropoietin, larger amounts of iron can be removed per session than by phlebotomy. However, this is not always available due to cost or lack of resources to perform the procedure. </p><p>The benefit of erythrocytapheresis was shown in a small randomized study in 38 newly-diagnosed patients homozygous for C282Y, who were randomly assigned to treatment with standard phlebotomy or erythrocytapheresis. The mean number of treatment procedures needed to reach a serum ferritin target level of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> was significantly lower in those assigned to receive erythrocytapheresis (9 versus 27; ratio 0.33; 95% CI 0.25-0.45) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Adjustment for initial serum ferritin levels and body weight had only a minimal effect on this ratio (0.43; 95% CI 0.35-0.52). Cost analysis showed no significant difference in treatment costs between the two procedures; the costs resulting from productivity loss were significantly lower for the erythrocytapheresis group.</p><p>This technique may result in the need for fewer treatment sessions and fewer side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>].
