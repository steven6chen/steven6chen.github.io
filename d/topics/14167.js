The benefits of MHT outweigh the risk for healthy, symptomatic women who are within 10 years of menopause or younger than age 60 years and who do not have contraindications to MHT (such as a history of breast cancer, coronary heart disease [CHD], a previous venous thromboembolic event or stroke, or active liver disease).</p><p>This topic will review the available estrogen and progestin preparations, as well as other types of hormone preparations. An overview of the risks and benefits of MHT, treatment of menopausal symptoms with MHT (including choice of therapy), nonhormonal treatment options, and the use of estrogen in women with early menopause (primary ovarian insufficiency [POI]) are reviewed separately.

In some countries, estrogen can also be given as a subcutaneous implant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78136 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Once a decision has been made to treat a woman with menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), consideration should be given to the type of estrogen and the route by which it is to be given, as well as the need for progestin and the most appropriate progestin regimen (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Progestin preparations'</a> below). Estrogen doses used for women who have menopausal symptoms are typically lower than doses used to treat women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure#H1222519042\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;, section on 'Estrogen therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Women being treated for menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes require systemic estrogen; women being treated only for vulvovaginal atrophy (now referred to as &quot;genitourinary syndrome of menopause&quot; [GSM]) should be treated with low-dose vaginal estrogen rather than systemic estrogen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of menopausal symptoms with hormone therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic estrogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic estrogen is most often administered orally or transdermally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78136 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;</a>). There are several important differences in the effects of these preparations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estrogen administered orally has a greater effect on the liver due to the first-pass effect because intestinal absorption leads to portal vein concentrations that are initially substantially higher than those after transdermal administration. Thus, oral estrogen administration increases hepatic production of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and clotting factors, whereas their production is only minimally increased by transdermal estrogen administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Furthermore, the saturation of bile with cholesterol is adversely affected by oral, but not transdermal, estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All estrogens are equally effective for managing menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. Transdermal estrogen is as effective as oral estrogen for preserving bone density (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51848\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51848 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Transdermal estrogen administration is associated with a lower risk of venous thrombosis and stroke, and it has less of an effect on serum lipid concentrations when compared with a comparable dose of oral estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy/abstract/2,3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6</a>].

Ethinyl estradiol is much more potent than the other estrogens used for MHT and, therefore, is used in very low doses (5 mcg). Ethinyl estradiol is used in at least one combined estrogen-progestin product that contains 2.5 to 5 mcg of ethinyl estradiol with 0.5 or 1 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78136 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3990570885\"><span class=\"h4\">Source</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most oral estrogen preparations, with the exception of CEEs, are derived from plant sources (soy and yams). There is no evidence that plant-derived estrogens have safety and efficacy advantages over those derived from pregnant mare urine. However, in our experience, many women prefer the plant-derived estrogens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1720165020\"><span class=\"h4\">Efficacy/potency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The different oral estrogens have similar efficacy. Conjugated estrogen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estrone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estrone</a> sulfate are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract primarily as estrone sulfate, which is biologically inactive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> is converted to estrone and then estrone sulfate in liver and other tissues. In women taking oral estradiol, circulating estrone sulfate accumulates as a large precursor pool. The estrone sulfate is then continuously desulfated and converted to estradiol. Therefore, even though oral estrogen is administered in a single daily dose, the resulting serum estradiol concentrations vary little between doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The potency, and therefore the doses, of these estrogen preparations differ, but they differ little in efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In general, 0.625 mg of conjugated estrogens or esterified estrogen is considered equivalent to 1 mg of micronized 17-beta <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a>, 0.05 mg of transdermal estradiol, or 5 mcg of ethinyl estradiol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78136\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78136 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H352147478\" class=\"local\">'Dose equivalents'</a> below.)</p><p>These doses protect bone and relieve vasomotor symptoms in most women. Lower doses are effective for vasomotor symptoms in many women; most experts recommend starting with low-dose estrogen unless the patient has severe symptoms. The dose can be titrated up if symptoms are not completely relieved by the low dose of estrogen. (See <a href=\"#H533431036\" class=\"local\">'Low-dose estrogen'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Transdermal estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many transdermal estrogen preparations available that contain 17-beta <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a>. There is a wide range of dosing options, from 14 mcg to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span>. A transdermal dose of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] is approximately equivalent to a 0.625 mg daily oral dose of conjugated estrogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The package labeling for transdermal estrogens expresses doses in &quot;mg&quot; rather than &quot;mcg&quot; (eg, 0.014, 0.05, 0.1 mg).</p><p>The lowest-dose patch containing 0.014 mg of 17-beta <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> is approved for prevention of osteoporosis. In some women, the dose is adequate for hot flash relief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. For women with a uterus, addition of a progestin is recommended, although the optimal interval for its administration is not known. For this low-dose patch (0.014 mg), many clinicians administer a 14-day cycle of oral progestin every 6 to 12 months, although this has not been well studied. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) package insert states to administer progestin for 14 days every 6 to 12 months <strong>and</strong> perform an endometrial biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533430863\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical estradiol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> preparations are commercially available.
