The pathophysiology, etiology, and diagnosis of gastroparesis and the management of malignancy-associated gastroparesis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-delayed-gastric-emptying\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of delayed gastric emptying&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-associated-gastroparesis-pathophysiology-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy-associated gastroparesis: Pathophysiology and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Our recommendations are largely consistent with the guidelines issued by the American Gastroenterological Association and the American College of Gastroenterology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81709740\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management of gastroparesis consists of dietary modification, optimization of glycemic control and hydration, and in patients with continued symptoms, pharmacologic therapy with prokinetic and antiemetics. A suggested approach to the management of gastroparesis based on the extent of delay in gastric emptying is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79991\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79991 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary modification is considered first-line therapy in patients with mild gastroparesis, although in clinical practice it is associated with only a modest improvement in symptoms. Foods that are fatty, acidic, spicy, and roughage-based increase overall symptoms in individuals with gastroparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Fat slows gastric emptying and nondigestible fiber (eg, fresh fruits and vegetables) require effective interdigestive antral motility that is frequently absent in patients with significantly delayed gastric emptying. Patients with gastroparesis should be advised by a dietician to consume small, frequent meals four to five times a day that are low in fat and contain only soluble fiber. For patients who are unable to tolerate solid food, meals should be homogenized, as gastric emptying of liquids is often normal even when emptying of solids is delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,6</a>]. Patients should also be advised to avoid carbonated beverages as they can aggravate gastric distention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Alcohol and smoking should also be avoided as they can decrease antral contractility and delay gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydration and nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent vomiting and reduced oral intake may result in hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and dehydration. Patients with gastroparesis can also develop micronutrient and vitamin deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients with prior gastric surgery are particularly susceptible to deficiencies in iron, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a>, fat-soluble vitamins, thiamine, and folate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric surgery: Postoperative nutritional management&quot;, section on 'Micronutrient management'</a>.)</p><p>Hydration and vitamin supplementation should be provided orally in patients with mild gastroparesis. For patients who are unable to tolerate solids, supplements and vitamins can be added to liquidized or homogenized meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients with refractory symptoms may require enteral or parenteral supplementation. (See <a href=\"#H81710536\" class=\"local\">'Decompression and feeding'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Optimize glycemic control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes mellitus is a common cause of delayed gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. While glycemic control should be advised in patients with diabetes to decrease the risk of microvascular complications, there are limited and conflicting data regarding the efficacy of long-term glycemic control on gastric emptying rates and symptoms of gastroparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. However, acute hyperglycemia has been demonstrated to slow gastric emptying in patients with diabetes mellitus and healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. In addition, hyperglycemia also attenuates the efficacy of prokinetic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p>In patients with diabetes, incretin-based therapies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramlintide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramlintide</a> and GLP1 analogues (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exenatide</a>) should be avoided as they can delay gastric emptying. In contrast, dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors (eg, vildagliptin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sitagliptin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sitagliptin</a>) do not affect gastric emptying. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amylin analogs for the treatment of diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Side effects and adverse events'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H1201411\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'GLP-1 receptor agonists'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81711981\"><span class=\"h2\">Prokinetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic therapy is necessary for patients who continue to have symptoms of gastroparesis despite dietary modification. Prokinetics increase the rate of gastric emptying and should be administered 10 to 15 minutes before meals with an additional dose before bedtime in patients with persistent symptoms. As compared with tablets, liquid formulations allow for easier dose titration and are less likely to accumulate in the stomach and cause erratic absorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79991\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79991 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Dietary modification'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81711495\"><span class=\"h3\">Metoclopramide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metoclopramide</a> is first-line therapy for gastroparesis. Metoclopramide, a dopamine 2 receptor antagonist, a 5-HT4 agonist, and a weak 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, improves gastric emptying by enhancing gastric antral contractions and decreasing postprandial fundus relaxation. Metoclopramide is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of gastroparesis for no longer than 12 weeks unless patients have a therapeutic benefit that outweighs the risks. The side effects associated with metoclopramide include central side effects of anxiety, restlessness, and depression, hyperprolactinemia, and QT interval prolongation. Extrapyramidal side effects, including dystonia in 0.2 percent of patients and tardive dyskinesia in 1 percent of patients, have led to a black box warning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In one observational study that included 479 reports of extrapyramidal side effects associated with metoclopramide, while acute dystonias were more likely in children and young adults and in females, parkinsonian reactions were more likely in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>It is important to inform patients of the side effects and to obtain written informed consent before treating patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>. We initiate treatment with a low-dose liquid formulation (eg, 5 mg, 15 minutes before meals and at bedtime), titrating up to identify the lowest effective dose. Many patients can tolerate treatment with up to 40 mg of oral metoclopramide per day, in divided doses, without significant adverse effects. &quot;Drug holidays&quot; or dose reductions (eg, 5 mg, before two main meals of the day) should be implemented whenever clinically possible. It is the author's practice to review these patients every three months to assess medication efficacy and adverse events, before repeat prescription. A drug holiday of two weeks between prescriptions helps to ensure that the patient is really benefitting from the medication, as evidenced by recurrence of gastroparesis symptoms, or inability to tolerate solid or calorie-rich foods. If patients remain asymptomatic while off metoclopramide, the length of the drug holiday is then prolonged. This is particularly relevant with postviral gastroparesis, which may go into remission on average 12 months after onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Patients should also be advised to inform the clinician of involuntary movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The management and prognosis of tardive dyskinesia and acute dystonia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-prevention-and-treatment#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tardive dyskinesia: Prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-schizophrenia-side-effect-management#H28219045\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia: Side effect management&quot;, section on 'Dystonias'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metoclopramide</a> can also be administered by intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous routes. In patients who cannot tolerate oral medications, metoclopramide can be administered subcutaneously, although experience is limited. Metoclopramide nasal spray has been demonstrated to reduce symptoms of&nbsp;gastroparesis&nbsp;in diabetic women with gastroparesis, but not in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. We suggest that a test dose of 2 mg subcutaneously be tried first and the metoclopramide dose limited to 5 to 10 mg three times daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81710655\"><span class=\"h3\">Domperidone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients whose symptoms fail to respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> or with side effects to metoclopramide, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a> at a dose of 10 mg three times daily and increase to 20 mg three times daily with an additional dose at bedtime, if symptoms persist. Domperidone, a dopamine 2 antagonist, is not readily available in the United States but is available in Canada and in other countries. In the United States, domperidone can be prescribed to patients only through a FDA Investigational New Drug application. </p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a> in diabetic gastroparesis is likely similar to that of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, trials of domperidone in diabetic gastroparesis have been small and have had methodologic limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Studies suggest domperidone may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Therefore, an electrocardiogram should be performed at baseline and while on treatment. Domperidone should be withheld if the corrected QT is &gt;450 ms in men and &gt;470 ms in women. Domperidone can cause hyperprolactinemia. Drug-drug interactions may occur with concomitant administration of cisapride, azole antifungals, and antiretrovirals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 2</a>).

Erythromycin also stimulates fundic contractility, or at least inhibits the accommodation response of the proximal stomach after food ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Patients who fail to respond to a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a> should be treated with oral erythromycin (liquid formulation, 40 to 250 mg three times daily before meals) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79991\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79991 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> should be administered for no longer than four weeks at a time, as the effect of erythromycin decreases due to tachyphylaxis. Use of higher doses (eg, 250 mg, compared with 40 mg) may be more likely to cause abdominal pain or induce tachyphylaxis. Chronic administration of oral erythromycin should be restricted to patients who have failed to respond to other prokinetics and who continue to demonstrate an improvement in symptoms over baseline and tolerance of oral feeding. Intravenous erythromycin should be reserved for acute exacerbations of gastroparesis in which oral intake is not tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H81710810\" class=\"local\">'Management of acute exacerbations'</a> below.)</p><p>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> significantly improves gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although gastric emptying is also improved with oral erythromycin, this improvement is smaller as compared with intravenous administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a systematic review of five clinical trials involving oral erythromycin for gastroparesis, 26 of 60 patients (43 percent) had an improvement in symptoms of gastroparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, the studies included were small (&le;13 subjects), of short duration (&le;4 weeks), and had methodologic limitations. </p><p>Tachyphylaxis to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> and potential side effects limit its use in the management of gastroparesis. Side effects of erythromycin include gastrointestinal toxicity, ototoxicity, the induction of resistant bacterial strains, QT prolongation, and sudden death, particularly when used in patients taking medications that inhibit CYP3A4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azithromycin</a> &mdash; Azithromycin has a longer half-life, and fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects and drug interactions as compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>. However, azithromycin is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 and like erythromycin may prolong cardiac repolarization and the QT interval, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and torsade de pointes. </p><p>There are no randomized trials directly comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> in patients with gastroparesis. In a case-control study with 120 patients, there was no significant difference in gastric emptying between patients who received azithromycin as compared with erythromycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A manometric study found that when azithromycin and erythromycin were given in similar doses intravenously, they had a similar positive effect on antral motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. When a higher dose of azithromycin (500 mg) was used, the mean amplitude, duration of antral activity, and motility index were all increased compared with erythromycin (250 mg).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cisapride</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cisapride, a 5HT4 agonist, stimulates antral and duodenal motility and accelerates gastric emptying of solids and liquids, which in open-label trials has been maintained for up to one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-45</a>]. Although cisapride is better tolerated than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a>, its use has been associated with important drug interactions with medications metabolized by the cytochrome P450-3A4 isoenzyme (eg, macrolide antibiotics, antifungals, and phenothiazines) resulting in cardiac arrhythmias and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In the United States, prescriptions for cisapride can only be filled through an investigational limited access program from the manufacturer after providing documentation as to need for cisapride and assessment of risk factors for cardiac arrhythmias in the individual patient (eg, a QTc &gt;450 ms). However, cisapride is available in several other countries.</p><p>If prescribed, cisapride should be administered to patients who have failed a trial of all other prokinetics, at a dose of 10 to 20 mg four times daily, one-half hour before each meal and at bedtime. Cisapride dose should not exceed 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day or 60 to 80 mg daily as cardiac arrhythmias have been observed when prescribed at high doses (&gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day), or when administered with a drug that inhibits its metabolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 2</a>). Other side effects of cisapride, including abdominal discomfort and diarrhea, respond to dose reduction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiemetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiemetics have not been studied in the management of patients with gastroparesis, and their use in gastroparesis is based on their efficacy in controlling nonspecific nausea and vomiting and in chemotherapy-induced emesis. We treat patients with persistent nausea and vomiting despite prokinetics with antihistamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> 12.5 mg orally or intravenously every six to eight hours as needed) and in patients with persistent symptoms, 5HT3 antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> 4 to 8 mg orally three times daily). Prolongation of the QT interval and central side effects have limited the use of phenothiazines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a> 5 to 10 mg orally three times daily, 5 to 25 mg twice daily per rectum as needed) to patients who remain symptomatic despite antihistamines and 5HT3 antagonists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79991\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79991 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>When coadministering antiemetics and prokinetics it is important to consider potential metabolic drug interactions that may result in high blood levels resulting in drug toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. First generation 5-HT3 antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=granisetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">granisetron</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolasetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolasetron</a>) are associated with electrocardiographic (ECG) changes. While most changes are small and insignificant, fatal arrhythmias have been reported in association with prolonged QT intervals. ECG monitoring is recommended in patients on 5HT3 antagonists with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or patients taking concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval. In contrast to phenothiazines, 5HT3 antagonists have not been associated with cognitive, psychomotor, or affective disturbances. The side effects of antiemetics are discussed in detail, separately.

However, prior to placement of a jejunostomy tube, we perform a trial of nasojejunal feeding for three days to ensure that at least 80 mL of enteral nutrition can be delivered per hour, as this rate is essential if jejunal feeding is to succeed in the long term. The advantages and disadvantages of different feeding tubes in the setting of gastroparesis are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89921\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89921 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Patients on enteral feeding are permitted small-volume liquid meals by mouth during the day. A nutrient formula should be selected in consultation with an expert in nutrition, and guided by the individual patient's caloric, fat, protein, and supplement needs and the caloric density and osmolality of the formula. The concomitant presence of small intestinal disease may reduce the tolerance to high osmolality and high nitrogen-containing formulas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Formulations'</a>.) </p><p>Parenteral nutrition should be restricted to patients with severe gastric and small intestinal dysmotility who have failed enteral nutrition with prokinetics and antiemetic therapy. Parenteral nutrition is seldom necessary in patients with gastroparesis, unless it is part of a generalized motility disorder (eg, hollow visceral myopathy, progressive systemic sclerosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Indications for surgery include placement of an enterostomy tube (eg, gastrostomy, jejunostomy) that cannot be placed endoscopically and completion or subtotal gastrectomy to relieve refractory nausea and vomiting in patients with a partial gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H81710536\" class=\"local\">'Decompression and feeding'</a> above.)</p><p>Surgical pyloroplasty and gastrojejunostomy have also been performed to treat refractory gastroparesis. As an example, in one series that included 28 patients with gastroparesis, pyloroplasty was associated with an improvement in symptoms, gastric emptying, and a reduction in the need for prokinetics at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, long-term studies are needed before they can be recommended. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367359777\"><span class=\"h2\">Tricyclic antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In open-label trials, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with low anticholinergic effects, has been demonstrated to decrease symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain in patients with diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. However, TCAs can potentially decrease the rate of gastric emptying. In addition, results from a randomized trial failed to demonstrate a benefit of nortriptyline as compared with placebo in patients with gastroparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. If a therapeutic trial is being considered, their use should therefore be limited to patients with symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting despite a venting gastrostomy tube for decompression. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67864665\"><span class=\"h2\">Other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data to support the use of acupuncture in patients with delayed gastric emptying. </p><p>Endoscopic placement of a transpyloric stent, which is anchored by suturing on the gastric side, has been evaluated in patients with gastroparesis. In an open-label trial in which a total of 30 patients with refractory gastroparesis underwent 48 transpyloric stent procedures, clinical response was reported in 21 of 28 patients (75 percent), with greater efficacy in those with predominant nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting than in those with predominant pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Other potential therapies that have been successful in small studies in treating gastroparesis include endoscopic pyloromyotomy (gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy) and laparoscopic pyloroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>]. However, randomized sham-controlled trials are required to establish the role of these therapeutic approaches in patients with gastroparesis. </p><p>In one single-blinded randomized trial, 19 patients with type 2 diabetes were assigned to two weeks of acupuncture or sham control. Acupuncture improved symptoms of postprandial fullness, early satiety, and bloating as compared with sham treatment control both at the end of the two weeks of treatment and at two-week follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Although gastric emptying of solids improved as compared with baseline in patients treated with acupuncture but not in patients treated with sham control, patients in the acupuncture arm had significantly lower gastric emptying times at baseline. </p><p>While transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">scopolamine</a>, neurokinin receptor-1 antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aprepitant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aprepitant</a>, and synthetic cannabinoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronabinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronabinol</a> have been used to treat gastroparesis, there are no randomized trials to support their use. </p><p>Intrapyloric injection of botulinum toxin is not recommended for patients with gastroparesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although observational studies suggested that injection of botulinum toxin into the pylorus can improve both gastric emptying and symptoms by inhibiting pylorospasm, randomized trials have failed to demonstrate an improvement in symptoms as compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-gastroparesis/abstract/63-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-70</a>]</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367359794\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric electrical stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric electrical stimulation may be considered for compassionate treatment in patients with refractory symptoms, particularly nausea and vomiting (eg, with persistence of symptoms despite antiemetic and prokinetic drug therapy for at least one year). Gastric electrical stimulation has been demonstrated to improve symptom severity and gastric emptying in patients with diabetic, but not idiopathic or postsurgical gastroparesis. In the United States, the gastric electrical neurostimulator (Enterra Therapy system) has been approved as a humanitarian exemption device for diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis.
