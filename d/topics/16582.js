For the purpose of this topic review, we will use the term &quot;SVT&quot; to refer only to atrioventricular (AV) reciprocating mechanisms (AVRT and AVNRT), excluding primary atrial tachycardias, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation, which are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-tachycardias-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial tachycardias in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial flutter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SVT is the most common rhythm disturbance in children, with an estimated prevalence of 0.1 to 0.4 percent in the general pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among children with congenital heart disease (CHD), the prevalence of SVT is approximately 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the majority of patients presenting with SVT have structurally normal hearts.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Frequency of AVRT and AVNRT</strong> &ndash; The two most common forms of SVT in children are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT), including the Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'AV reentrant tachycardia'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'AV nodal reentrant tachycardia'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a report of 137 pediatric patients who presented with SVT and underwent electrophysiologic (EP) testing, 73 percent were found to have AVRT as the mechanism, 13 percent had AVNRT, and 14 percent had primary atrial tachycardias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A similar distribution of causes was noted in another report of 346 patients (mean age 14 years) who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation for recurrent SVT or ventricular tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. AVRT and AVNRT accounted for 72 and 9 percent, respectively, with various other arrhythmias comprising the remaining 19 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The relative frequencies of AVRT and AVNRT vary somewhat according to age. AVRT (including WPW) accounts for the great majority of cases in infancy (&gt;80 percent). It also is the most common category in older children, but the relative frequency is less than in infancy (50 to 60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. In contrast, AVNRT is rare before the age of two years and accounts for 20 to 35 percent of SVTs in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevalence of preexcitation</strong> &ndash; Preexcitation refers to early activation of the ventricles due to impulses bypassing the AV node via an accessory pathway.

This is termed the WPW pattern.

Most asymptomatic patients with the WPW pattern on ECG remain asymptomatic. However, there is a risk of symptomatic arrhythmia, including sudden death. This is discussed in greater detail separately.

In one study, the reported prevalence of SVT in children with CHD was 6.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. CHD is more common in children with WPW syndrome than in those with AVNRT (20 to 32 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A particular association between Ebstein anomaly and AVRT has been noted; 10 to 15 percent of children with WPW have Ebstein anomaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], while 5 to 25 percent of children with Ebstein anomaly have WPW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Ebstein anomaly is also associated with the presence of multiple accessory pathways in AVRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>].

This includes atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT, including Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome) and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. A reentrant rhythm involves two distinct pathways for conduction with unidirectional block in one of the two pathways. This creates a circuit through which an electrical impulse can cycle repetitively in one direction (antegrade or retrograde), with consequent rapid, regular ventricular contractions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52134 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reentry and the development of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">AV reentrant tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AVRT requires an extranodal accessory pathway connecting the atrium and ventricle. This allows direct electrical communication between the two chambers.</p><p>Accessory pathways can be located anywhere along the right and left AV groove. The most common sites are the left lateral AV groove and posteroseptal region. Right-sided pathways are less common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77941 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The classic accessory pathway connects atrial and ventricular myocardium directly. Rarely, connections can also be made with the conducting system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69078 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53343\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53343 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Antegrade versus retrograde</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms &quot;antegrade&quot; and &quot;retrograde&quot; refer to the direction of electrical conduction relative to the atrium and ventricle. Accessory pathways may conduct electrical signals solely in the antegrade direction (from atrium to ventricle), solely in the retrograde direction (from ventricle to atrium), or may be capable of both antegrade and retrograde conduction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the accessory pathway conducts impulses in the <strong>antegrade</strong> direction, the impulse arrives at the ventricle rapidly, without the delay imposed by the AV node, a phenomenon called &quot;<strong>preexcitation</strong>.&quot; The result is a characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern during sinus rhythm consisting of a short PR interval, a &quot;delta wave&quot; (both of which reflect preexcitation), and a widened QRS complex due to the delta wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75296\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75296 \">figure 4</a>). This ECG pattern is referred to as the WPW pattern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome#H13260510\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&quot;, section on 'Electrocardiographic findings'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the accessory pathway conducts impulses in only the <strong>retrograde</strong> direction, it is referred to as a &quot;<strong>concealed pathway</strong>&quot; because the ECG during sinus rhythm appears normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome#H20061242\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&quot;, section on 'Prevalence of concealed accessory pathways'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Orthodromic versus antidromic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms &quot;orthodromic&quot; and &quot;antidromic&quot; refer to the direction of electrical conduction through the AV node:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common type of SVT is <strong>orthodromic</strong> AVRT, in which the reentrant circuit conducts impulses antegrade down the AV node through the His-Purkinje system to the ventricles and then retrograde up the accessory pathway. This results in a narrow complex tachycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77867\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77867 \">waveform 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71302\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71302 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, <strong>antidromic</strong> AVRT is uncommon (&lt;5 percent of patients).The reentrant circuit conducts impulses antegrade down an accessory pathway (which does not involve the ventricular conducting system) and retrograde up the AV node. This causes a wide complex tachycardia because conduction through the ventricular myocardium is slower than through the conducting system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50433 \">figure 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54484\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54484 \">waveform 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) is a variant of orthodromic AVRT in which the retrograde conduction in the accessory pathway is slow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67767\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67767 \">waveform 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Slow retrograde conduction through the accessory pathway coupled with the normally slow conduction antegrade through the AV node creates a stable reentrant circuit. As a result, PJRT is an incessant SVT, in contrast to the typically paroxysmal nature of most SVTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. PJRT is of particular concern because its persistence can lead to tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Heart failure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">AV nodal reentrant tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AVNRT is mediated by the presence, within the AV node, of two conducting pathways that are designated fast and slow. The fast pathway has a short conduction time but long refractory period. The slow pathway has a long conduction time but short refractory period. These distinct pathways allow for a reentrant loop using one pathway in the antegrade direction and one in the retrograde direction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Typical AVNRT utilizes the slow pathway in the antegrade direction and the fast pathway in the retrograde direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79760 \">figure 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50122\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50122 \">figure 8</a>). Atypical AVNRT employs the fast pathway in the antegrade direction and the slow pathway in the retrograde direction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56806\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56806 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p>The two pathways have distinct anatomic locations. Based upon electrophysiologic (EP) studies in adult patients, the fast pathway is found in the anterior septum, while the slow pathway is recorded in the posterior septum near the mouth of the coronary sinus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Although it has been proposed that the ability to generate AVNRT implies the presence of dual, anatomically distinct AV nodal pathways, the two pathways may not be demonstrated with EP studies. This was illustrated in a report of 159 children with AVNRT in which 38 percent did not have clear dual AV node physiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It has been suggested that, in children without dual AV node physiology, the reentry circuit may incorporate atrial muscle tissue several millimeters outside the compact AV node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms of SVT vary according to age:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infants</strong> &ndash; In infants, symptoms of SVT may include pallor, fussiness, irritability, poor feeding, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cyanosis. The symptoms can be subtle, and tachycardia may go unrecognized for long periods of time. Because of this, infants often present with symptoms of heart failure (eg, tachypnea, fatigue with feeding, poor weight gain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Syncope and atrial fibrillation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>SVT is usually paroxysmal and characterized by abrupt onset and termination. Most SVT episodes occur at rest, although exercise can be a trigger in some patients.</p><p>The average duration is 10 to 15 minutes; however, some episodes last only one to two minutes, while others persist for hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. More persistent SVT can occur, most commonly due to atrial tachycardias or permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia'</a> above.)</p><p>Most children tolerate episodes of tachycardia well. However, prolonged episodes can precipitate heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Heart failure'</a> below.)</p><p>Physical examination typically reveals tachycardia without evidence of decompensation. Some patients appear pale and diaphoretic, and the blood pressure may be reduced.

It is an abnormally rapid heart rhythm originating above the ventricles, often (but not always) with a narrow QRS complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77867\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77867 \">waveform 2</a>). The two most common forms of SVT in children are atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT, including the Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome) and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). In this topic review, we use the term &quot;SVT&quot; to refer only to atrioventricular (AV) reciprocating mechanisms (AVRT and AVNRT), excluding primary atrial tachycardias, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation. Although most patients with SVT have structurally normal hearts, children with congenital heart disease are at the greatest risk for SVT. (See <a href=\"#H152506265\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both AVRT and AVNRT are reentrant rhythms (two distinct pathways for conduction with unidirectional block in one of the two pathways), which allows an electrical impulse to cycle repetitively, resulting in rapid and regular ventricular contractions. AVRT is particularly common during infancy, while AVNRT is more common after two years of age. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs and symptoms of SVT vary according to age. In infants, symptoms of SVT may include pallor, fussiness, irritability, poor feeding, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cyanosis. If tachycardia goes unrecognized for a long period of time, symptoms of heart failure (eg, tachypnea, fatigue with feeding, poor weight gain) can develop. Common symptoms of SVT in children and adolescents include palpitations, chest discomfort, fatigue, and lightheadedness. Syncope is less common and may be a warning sign for increased risk of sudden death. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of SVT is based chiefly on the electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. Ambulatory monitoring can help establish the frequency and duration of SVT. Infants and children with preexcitation on ECG or documented SVT should be referred for evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist. Electrophysiologic testing is often performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation of clinically significant SVT in children, particularly if catheter ablation is planned. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodes of SVT are usually paroxysmal and characterized by abrupt onset and termination. The average duration is 10 to 15 minutes. During SVT, the ECG exhibits a regular rhythm (ie, no variation in the RR interval) with a rate that is usually 220 to 280 bpm in infants and 180 to 240 bpm in older children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77867\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77867 \">waveform 2</a>). In most cases, the QRS complex is narrow (&lt;80 msec). Wide complex QRS tachycardia occurs in antidromic AVRT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50433\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50433 \">figure 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54484\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54484 \">waveform 3</a>) and occasionally in other reentrant tachycardias with aberrant conduction (eg, functional bundle branch block or &quot;bundle branch aberration&quot;). In sinus rhythm, patients with WPW exhibit preexcitation with a characteristic delta wave, widening of the QRS, and short PR interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75578\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef75578 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76226\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef76226 \">waveform 6</a>). The ECG in sinus rhythm is normal in patients with concealed accessory pathways or AVNRT. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with SVT in early infancy, symptoms often resolve by one year of age and long-term therapy may not be needed; however, some patients may have recurrence later in childhood. By contrast, SVT tends to persist in children who present after the age of five years. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Josephson ME, Wellens HJ.
