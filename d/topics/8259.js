A hip fracture is when a person breaks the top of the thigh bone (femur) near the hip joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82793\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82793 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There are different types of hip fractures. The type of hip fracture depends on which part of the thigh bone breaks and how it breaks.</p><p>Hip fractures are usually caused by falls. Hip fractures happen most often in older adults, especially those with a disease that makes the bones weak, called osteoporosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16484048\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a hip fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of a hip fracture include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the hip or groin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being unable to walk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising</p><p/><p>A hip fracture can also make the injured leg look like it's turned away from the body and shorter than the uninjured leg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16484063\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a hip fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about your injury and symptoms, do an exam, and order an X-ray.</p><p>Some people need an imaging test called an MRI scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16484078\"><span class=\"h1\">How are hip fractures treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, your doctor will treat your pain. Doctors can use different medicines to treat pain. The medicines can come as a shot, pill, or through a thin tube that goes into your vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p>Then most people with a hip fracture are treated with surgery. People usually have surgery within a few days of their injury. Doctors can use 2 main types of surgery to treat a hip fracture, depending on the type of fracture.</p><p>In one type of surgery, the doctor puts screws, pins, rods, or plates inside the body to fix the fracture.</p><p>The other type of surgery used to treat a hip fracture is a total or partial hip replacement. During this surgery, the doctor replaces either the whole hip joint or parts of it with man-made replacements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65030\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65030 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>After surgery, you will work with a physical therapist (exercise expert). He or she will teach you exercises to make the muscles around your hip stronger. He or she will work with you on bending, walking, and climbing stairs so you can move normally.</p><p>In some cases, hip fractures are not treated with surgery. For instance, people who have a mild fracture and are still able to walk might not need surgery. Their fracture will heal on its own.</p><p>After your hip fracture, your doctor will probably test you for osteoporosis. This involves a special X-ray called a bone density test. Your doctor might also treat you for osteoporosis. Treatment for osteoporosis usually involves medicines called bisphosphonates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16484093\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do hip fractures take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hip fractures take weeks to months to heal, depending on the type of fracture.</p><p>Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal much more quickly than older adults or adults with other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16484108\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your hip fracture is healing. Plus, your doctor will probably recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a healthy diet that includes getting enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking. A fracture can take longer to heal if you smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16484123\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get a fever.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe pain, or your pain or swelling gets worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your leg gets swollen or you see red streaks on your leg.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have chest pain, trouble breathing, or dizziness.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid or pus drains out of the cut from your surgery.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get an open sore on your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16484138\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pelvic fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-replacement-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hip replacement (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone density testing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-falls-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preventing falls (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pressure-sores-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pressure sores (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Total hip replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
