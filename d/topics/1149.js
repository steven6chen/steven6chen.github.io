In one study of HIV-infected patients undergoing brain biopsy for the diagnosis of focal CNS lesions, 6 percent had more than one etiology established from histologic sampling of a single lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough knowledge of the various etiologies for CNS disease in the HIV-infected patient is important for proper evaluation and management. The leading diagnostic considerations in a patient with advanced immunosuppression are Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE), primary CNS lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, HIV encephalopathy, and CMV encephalitis.</p><p>Patients who are not under medical supervision, or those who are not aware of their HIV status, may present with their first opportunistic infection in the central nervous system. The clinical manifestations and the diagnostic possibilities are similar to those seen in before the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) era.</p><p>However, the effect of prophylaxis for Pneumocystis and the use of ART may alter the clinical spectrum of disease and the diagnostic considerations in patients who are taking medications. Although the list of etiologies is essentially the same, the incidence and the spectrum of disease has changed as illustrated by the following points:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of TMP-SMX prophylaxis against Pneumocystis is also effective for the prevention of TE. In one study, the frequency of TE decreased from 72.2 to 18.6 percent from 1991 to 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The introduction of potent ART has been associated with a declining incidence of HIV encephalopathy, primary CNS lymphoma, and progressive multifocal encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. On the other hand, it is possible that ART may be contributing to a new form of severe, demyelinating leukoencephalopathy characterized by intense perivascular infiltration by HIV antigens and inflammatory cells with widespread myelin loss and axonal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOLOGIC APPEARANCE OF CNS LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discovery of a CNS lesion is made by head CT or MRI. These examinations must be performed before and after injection of contrast material to determine whether a lesion enhances on neuroimaging. Enhancement usually signifies the presence of inflammation. Clinicians need to be aware that steroid therapy, which reduces inflammatory responses, can convert enhancing into nonenhancing lesions. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Corticosteroids'</a> below.)</p><p>MRI has a number of advantages compared to CT scan. It is much more sensitive than CT scan in determining if a lesion is truly solitary; it has greater sensitivity for white matter disease or lesions in the posterior fossa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; and, if a biopsy is being considered, it may identify a peripheral lesion that is more accessible for histologic sampling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74958\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74958 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>CNS mass lesions can be classified into two categories, according to the presence or absence of mass effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">CNS lesions with mass effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CNS mass lesions are characterized by the presence of swelling, edema, and mass effect on surrounding structures. In some cases, especially for lesions located in the posterior fossa, cerebral herniation occurs. Mass lesions usually enhance after the injection of contrast material, indicating local inflammation and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Patients with mass effect can present with headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and lethargy, all of which may reflect evidence of increased intracranial pressure.</p><p>The two leading diagnoses associated with mass effect in developed countries are Toxoplasma encephalitis and primary central system lymphoma. In the developing world, tuberculomas are a leading diagnostic consideration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxoplasma encephalitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) represents reactivation disease from prior infection. Affected patients present with fever, headache, altered mental status, and focal neurologic complaints or seizures. Supporting laboratory findings include the presence of Toxoplasma antibodies, which is consistent with past exposure, and advanced immunosuppression with CD4 counts &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TE lesions are generally multiple and are localized in the parietal or frontal lobes, in the thalamus or basal ganglia, or at the corticomedullary junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Ring enhancement is present in approximately 90 percent and surrounding edema with mass effect is often seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F74466\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74466 \">image 2</a>). Uncommonly, TE can present as a diffuse encephalitis, which is not associated with focal abscess formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The neuroradiologic characteristics of TE are not pathognomonic and may be observed in other conditions, particularly lymphoma. If a single lesion is seen, an MRI should be obtained to determine whether the lesion is truly solitary. Although single lesions can be seen in TE infection, solitary large (&gt;4 cm) lesions are more suspicious for primary CNS lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Primary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary central nervous system lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) can present with confusion, lethargy, memory loss, hemiparesis, aphasia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> seizures. In addition, constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, occur in over 80 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Primary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to patients with toxoplasmosis, solitary and multiple mass lesions occur with approximately equal frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The majority of lesions display some degree of enhancement that is irregular or patchy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68209\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68209 \">image 3</a>). However, diffuse ring enhancement, identical to that commonly seen in TE, can occur.</p><p>The location and size may also be helpful to distinguish Toxoplasma infection from PCNSL. As an example, lesions that involve the corpus callosum or the periventricular or periependymal areas are more likely to be due to PCNSL, whereas posterior fossa lesions are more likely due to infection. Lesions that are larger than 4 cm in size are more likely to be lymphoma. However, these neuroradiologic characteristics do not discriminate well enough between TE and PCNSL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Other infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other opportunistic infections can be associated with focal CNS lesions with or without mass effect, depending upon their size and location. These include brain abscesses secondary to Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Salmonella, Aspergillus, Nocardia, Rhodococcus, Listeria, unusual granulomatous collections, such as cryptococcomas, and syphilitic gummas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. However, most of these entities are much less common than TE or PCNSL and are often associated with evidence of disseminated infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In the developing world, neurocysticercosis or tuberculosis can present as single or multiple mass lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The appearance of neurocysticercosis depends upon the stage of the infection and the host immune response. Tuberculomas can present as a focal lesion without evidence of systemic illness or meningeal infection.

Patients with PML characteristically present with rapidly progressive focal neurologic deficits including hemiparesis, visual field deficits, ataxia, aphasia, and cognitive impairment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progressive-multifocal-leukoencephalopathy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PML is usually characterized by multifocal areas of demyelination that are bilateral, asymmetric, and localized preferentially to the periventricular areas and the subcortical white matter. The lesions are generally not contrast-enhancing and are not surrounded by edema; as a result, substantial mass effect on surrounding structures is absent. However, PML may occur in the setting of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) associated with increase of CD4+ T cell count and drop of HIV plasma viral load on antiretroviral therapy. In this context, <span class=\"nowrap\">PML/IRIS</span> can present with contrast enhancement on MRI, as well as focal edema and mass effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The following results were calculated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The probability of TE was 0.87 in Toxoplasma seropositive patients with mass effect who were not on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX), but only 0.59 for those receiving prophylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Toxoplasma seropositive patients receiving TMP-SMX, the probability of PCNSL was 0.36.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Toxoplasma seronegative patients with mass effect, the probability of PCNSL was 0.74, which increased to 0.96 if EBV PCR was positive in the CSF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among focal brain lesions without mass effect, the probability of PML was 0.81, which increased to 0.99 if JCV DNA was detected in the CSF.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric Toxoplasma therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A trial of empiric therapy for possible TE may be considered as an alternative to brain biopsy when the above tests have not clearly identified a specific cause in a patient who presents with focal CNS pathology but does not have manifestations of mass effect requiring early brain biopsy. Thus, clinical symptoms and signs, neuroimaging, CD4 cell count, serologies, PCR results, and use of concomitant medications, which could alter the diagnostic considerations, all need to be weighed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have advanced immunosuppression? If not, then tumors such as glioblastoma or metastatic disease need to be excluded, as in HIV-seronegative patients. If the patient has severe immunosuppression, then TE, PCNSL, and PML are the leading diagnostic considerations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have multiple lesions, which are radiologically consistent with TE or PCNSL? If serologic studies show that the patient is seropositive for Toxoplasma, then TE becomes more likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, as noted in the previous section, the likelihood of TE is much lower if the seropositive patient is taking TMP-SMX for prophylaxis for Pneumocystis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]. The possibility of TE is also low (about 5 percent) if the patient is seronegative for Toxoplasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In these settings, a brain biopsy should be pursued rapidly to make a diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have a large solitary lesion greater than 4 cm in diameter? If so, then PCNSL is most likely and tissue diagnosis is helpful. An empiric trial of treatment for TE is often employed if there is no immediate concern for herniation risk. An imaging study should be repeated in approximately one week with plans for early biopsy if no improvement is seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have asymmetric lesions without mass effect that primarily involve white matter? In this setting, PML is the leading diagnosis and CSF examination can help make a presumptive diagnosis if JC virus can be isolated. Empiric Toxoplasma therapy is <strong>not</strong> warranted in such patients.</p><p/><p>The empiric regimen for possible TE is discussed separately. Empiric therapy is usually given for 10 to 14 days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is critical to closely monitor the patient's neurologic examination during a trial of empiric therapy. Clinical improvement is expected within one to two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The diagnosis of TE is established if the patient clinically improves and there is a reduction in lesion size within two weeks. A brain biopsy should be considered in patients who do not have clinical and radiologic improvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corticosteroid therapy should be considered in two settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When substantial mass effect can be demonstrated on imaging and the mental status is significantly depressed. Such patients are at risk for cerebral herniation.

This is important clinically, since the prognosis of HIVE and PML has improved dramatically with the advent of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hiv-infected-patients-with-central-nervous-system-lesions/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4660646\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important factor in determining the differential diagnosis in an HIV-infected patient with suspected central nervous system (CNS) pathology is the degree of immunosuppression in the host. CNS mass lesions are most common in severely immunosuppressed patients with CD4 cell counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The leading diagnostic considerations in a patient with advanced immunosuppression are Toxoplasma encephalitis, primary CNS lymphoma, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, HIV encephalopathy, and CMV encephalitis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The discovery of a CNS lesion is made by head CT or MRI. These examinations must be performed before and after injection of contrast material to determine whether a lesion enhances on neuroimaging. Enhancement usually signifies the presence of inflammation. An MRI is more sensitive than a head CT in determining if a lesion is truly solitary. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic appearance of CNS lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CNS mass lesions are characterized by the presence of swelling, edema, and mass effect on surrounding structures. The two leading diagnoses associated with mass effect in developed countries are Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) and primary central system lymphoma. In the developing world, tuberculomas are a leading diagnostic consideration. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'CNS lesions with mass effect'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions without mass effect usually do not enhance after the injection of contrast material and are not associated with a risk of herniation. The vast majority of these lesions are due to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or HIV-associated encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'CNS lesions without mass effect'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in patients with focal signs or with lesions producing mass effect, especially in the posterior fossa, due to the risk of transtentorial herniation. If the patient does not have any focality on examination and mass effect is not evident, then consideration should be given to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, although its utility is limited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF cytology can help in the diagnosis of lymphoma if it is positive, but this occurs in only 15 percent of cases with meningeal seeding. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis may assist in identifying the DNA of JC virus (the causative agent of PML), Epstein-Barr virus (associated with lymphoma), and <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'CSF examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of empiric therapy for possible TE may be considered as an alternative to brain biopsy when in a patient who presents with focal CNS pathology but does not have manifestations of mass effect requiring early brain biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Empiric Toxoplasma therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticosteroid therapy should be considered in the presence of mass effect since these patients are at increased risk of herniation. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Corticosteroids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stereotactic brain biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of focal CNS lesions in AIDS, since several studies have demonstrated the inadequacy of clinical acumen alone. However, biopsy may not be possible with lesions in certain locations.
