The feeding vessel most commonly originates from the aorta, although other origins, such as the splenic artery or gastric artery, have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. BPS accounts for only 0.15 to 6.4 percent of congenital lung malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Eighty percent of cases occur on the left [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>BPS is classified anatomically as intralobar or extralobar:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In intralobar pulmonary sequestration (ILS, also known as intrapulmonary sequestration), the mass is located within the normal lung and is covered by the visceral pleura of the lung. Postnatally, ILS accounts for about 75 percent of BPS and is almost always located in the lower lobes, most commonly in the left medial or posterior segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Venous drainage is usually via the pulmonary vein to the left atrium, although connections to the vena cava, azygous vein, or right atrium also occur. ILS is distributed equally between sexes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In extralobar pulmonary sequestration (ELS, also known as extrapulmonary sequestration), the mass is located outside the normal lung and has its own visceral pleura. Postnatally, about 25 percent of BPS is extralobar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. An extralobar lesion can occur between the neck and diaphragm, within the diaphragm, or infradiaphragmatically, where it can mimic a suprarenal neuroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. The most common location is between the left lower lobe and hemidiaphragm (80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. Ten to 15 percent are subdiaphragmatic, usually in the suprarenal space and left-sided (90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A case report described ELS with combined gastric and intradiaphragmatic locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most ELS drains to the systemic circulation through the azygous or hemiazygous vein or vena cava [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Hybrid lesions have cystic and solid components. BPS is usually unilateral, but bilateral cases have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A characteristic feature is visualization of a systemic artery to the fetal lung lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51114\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51114 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50003\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50003 \">image 4</a>). Color and power Doppler assessments are critical for identification of the systemic vascular supply, which typically arises from the abdominal or thoracic aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Even with thorough assessment, however, the vascular supply may not be visualized prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>].</p><p>When evaluating the fetus with a thoracic lesion, it is important to also assess for midline shift, pleural effusions and other signs of hydrops, and associated abnormalities. </p><p>The use of <a href=\"http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(06)01860-6/abstract&amp;token=yaP5ui3z9AjbtoKNwvA/3sKHjDiE/Vv+GxkKEfAYNFebzkRggwoKhKow2w3nSe9PXv5n3p68Dv0rpRa13T56fKqEjm5oUNu9/959UUJhCq4=&amp;TOPIC_ID=13515\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation</a> (CCAM) volume ratio (CVR) has been studied in pulmonary sequestration as well. CVR is obtained by multiplying height, length, and width of the lung lesion and dividing by the head circumference. It allows direct comparison of fetuses of different gestational ages. In pulmonary sequestration, a CVR &gt;1.6 is associated with a higher risk for hydrops but does not uniformly result in hydrops; only 58 percent of fetuses with a high CVR developed hydrops in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, CVR can be used to identify fetuses in need of closer follow up, but cannot be used to decide surgical management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31928907\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging typically reveals a hyperintense T2w mass in the lower lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,16</a>]. The feeding vessel may be a low signal line coursing from the aorta into the mass. MR does not always demonstrate the abnormal vessels, but is helpful in delineating the mass and its location (chest, diaphragm, or infradiaphragmatic), evaluating the contralateral lung, and assessing for other congenital abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369876539\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic images</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intralobar sequestration at 29 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51114\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51114 \">image 3</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extralobar sequestration at 32 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50003\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50003 \">image 4</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left lower lobe high lung mass with moderate left pleural effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105395\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105395 \">image 5</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlarging pleural effusion at 28 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105396\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105396 \">image 6</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic feeding vessel to pulmonary mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105398\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef105398 \">image 7</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31928913\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prenatal differential diagnosis of BPS includes:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31928919\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both microcystic congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) and BPS appear solid and homogeneous on ultrasound and MR imaging.

Prenatally, this diagnosis can be difficult to differentiate from microcystic CPAM and BPS. The presence of normal pulmonary vascularity excludes BPS and microcystic CPAM, but this can be difficult to demonstrate. The diagnosis is confirmed postnatally by computed tomography, which shows emphysematous alveoli in CLE and distorted lung tissue in microcystic CPAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Mediastinal and cardiac deviation may be the only hint that a CDH is present in the relatively rare instances where the stomach remains infradiaphragmatic. When the stomach is herniated into the hemithorax, nonvisualization of stomach bubble within the abdomen is helpful for making the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19</a>]. Peristalsis of bowel loops in the thorax can sometimes be seen by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Deviation of the umbilical portion of the portal vein suggests liver herniation into the thorax. Direct visualization of hepatic vessels extending into the chest confirms liver in the thoracic cavity. MR is particularly useful in assessing the amount of liver herniation and delineation of small and large meconium filled bowel in the chest. Meconium is dark on T2 and bright on T1, while liver is high on T1w and intermediate on T2w, thus easily differentiated from adjacent lung.

The initial appearance is that of an echogenic and solid-appearing lesion without internal flow. Subsequently, a hypoechoic central region develops, and then a more cystic appearance and a decrease in size are observed. Dystrophic calcifications may develop. On MR, hemosiderin may be present in a hemorrhage. BPS has a systemic feeding vessel and is diagnosed in the second trimester whereas adrenal hemorrhage typically occurs in the third trimester and has no feeding vessel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3419725530\"><span class=\"h3\">Lung tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Though rare, malignancies such as pleuropulmonary blastoma can present as an asymptomatic congenital lung lesion. In a retrospective postnatal study involving 99 asymptomatic congenital lung lesions with 91 diagnosed prenatally, only 2 percent consisted of tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31928949\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large thoracic mass lesions in the fetus either regress in absolute size or relative to the thorax and thus cause minimal morbidity, or they enlarge, often resulting in mediastinal shift and hydrops.</p><p>BPS is usually a small lesion, and decreases in size in late gestation in about 75 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,21</a>]. However, masses that appeared to resolve in utero are typically found on postnatal computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The apparent resolution has been attributed to decompression into the normal lung, outgrowth of the systemic circulation, or torsion around vascular pedicle resulting in vascular and lymphatic obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As mentioned, torsion has been associated with size regression, but a case of mass torsion with impaired venous return from the mass leading to tension hydrothorax, <span class=\"nowrap\">heart/mediastinal</span> compression, and hydrops has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As these lesions regress, they become more difficult to visualize on ultrasound. On MR, the lesions may appear of lower signal intensity to lung on T2w as they regress.</p><p>When BPS presents as a large intrathoracic mass, the fetus is at risk of compression of the heart, thoracic venous structures, and esophagus resulting in hydrops and polyhydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,21,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21,25</a>]. Hydrops can also result from shunting when there is a systemic arterial feeder and the mass drains via the pulmonary circulation. However, large lesions with mediastinal shift, cardiac dextroposition, or cardiac compression do not always cause hydrops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Prognosis is typically very good in the absence of hydrops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21</a>]. Survival falls to 20 to 30 percent for fetuses with pleural effusion or polyhydramnios, but these cases are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In a series of 41 fetuses with extralobar pulmonary sequestration, 28 dramatically regressed on serial prenatal sonography, were asymptomatic after birth, and were only detectable by imaging studies postnatally (no resection performed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Of the remaining 13 fetuses, 2 underwent elective abortion, 1 hydropic fetus died, and 3 fetuses developed tension hydrothorax with secondary hydrops that was successfully treated by fetal thoracenteses or thoracoamniotic shunting followed by postnatal resection. Seven fetuses were symptomatic at birth and underwent resection of the lung lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31928955\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a lung mass is first identified, thorough assessment of the entire fetus is important to look for additional anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19</a>]. Intralobar sequestration is not associated with an increased risk of additional anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19</a>]. Extralobar BPS is associated with anomalies in up to two-thirds of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These anomalies include chest wall and vertebral anomalies hindgut duplications, diaphragmatic hernia, congenital heart disease, and renal and intracranial abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19</a>].</p><p>The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities is not increased above baseline in fetuses with BPS alone; this should be considered when weighing the risks and benefits of invasive prenatal genetic studies. Microarray is recommended prior to initiating fetal therapy; however, fetal intervention is rarely needed. On the other hand, the frequency of genetic abnormalities is increased in fetuses with additional anomalies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonimmune hydrops; microarray should be offered in these cases. </p><p>Parents should be counseled about the possible course of the BPS during pregnancy (likely decrease in size, but may increase, potential for hydrops), the potential need for and the options for prenatal intervention, the differential diagnosis of prenatally suspected BPS, and postnatal issues (clinical manifestations, postnatal evaluation, postnatal management, potential complications, prognosis of associated anomalies, and range of outcomes). At initial presentation in the early midtrimester, it is difficult to accurately predict what the outcome will be for an individual fetus, but some predictions are possible, eg, a large BPS with hydrops in the second trimester is likely to do poorly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchopulmonary-sequestration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchopulmonary sequestration&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All patients should have serial prenatal follow-up examinations to assess change in size of the lung mass and development of hydrops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The frequency depends on the size of the lesion; larger lesions should be followed more closely. A decrease in mass <span class=\"nowrap\">area/head</span> circumference or mass <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/estimated</span> fetal weight ratio is associated with regression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Follow-up ultrasound might not identify the lung lesion since BPS acquires the same echogenicity of normal lung, but it allows evaluation for hydrops and midline shift. &#160; </p><p>Performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) late in gestation adds information to that obtained by an early MRI, can better identify the feeding vessel compared to an early MRI, and improves the correlation with postnatal imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Although rare, the presence of hydrops is a sign of impending fetal demise and an indication for fetal intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This recommendation is based on results from small case series showing higher survival rates if hydrops resolves; no randomized trials have compared management approaches. A systematic review found that survival rates were significantly higher among hydropic fetuses who underwent prenatal drainage or resection than in hydropic controls who did not have these interventions (OR 9, 95% CI 3-101) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Because hydrops is uncommon, fetal intervention is rarely required and is warranted only in cases where the fetus is severely compromised and remote from term. For fetuses greater than 32 to 34 weeks of age, early delivery with immediate postnatal resection is a reasonable option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Ex utero intrapartum therapy (EXIT) has been used to stabilize fetuses with large lesions expected to have difficulty breathing at delivery (See <a href=\"#H31928961\" class=\"local\">'Delivery'</a> below.) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/25,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,30</a>].</p><p>For gestations between 20 and 32 weeks, several interventions with the goal of improving fetal hemodynamics and preventing lung hypoplasia have been described and appear to improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These interventions should only be undertaken at centers experienced in fetal surgery. Prenatal intervention requires extensive counseling to the parents on the potential risks versus benefits of surgery.</p><p>A macrocyst within BPS suggests a hybrid lesion (macrocystic CPAM and BPS).

It can be used as a temporizing maneuver to provide prognostic information about the possible result from placement of a thoracoamniotic shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/21,29,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,29,31,32</a>].

There is also a risk of trauma to the fetal chest wall, especially if the procedure is performed before 20 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In the previously mentioned series with four hydropic fetuses with extralobar sequestration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], hydrops resolved after serial thoracenteses in one fetus and after thoracoamniotic shunt placement in two fetuses; all three neonates underwent resection of the lesion after delivery in the mid to late third trimester.

This infant had good pulmonary function and development at 20 months of age. Percutaneous laser ablation of the feeding vessel is a less invasive procedure and has been reported to decrease tumor size, increase the mass of normal lung parenchyma, and reverse pleural effusion or hydrops in over 75 percent of cases reported in several small studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/4,33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,33-38</a>].

Sometimes two procedures were necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. After delivery, the patients were often asymptomatic, and did not require surgical intervention. In a retrospective study that compared shunt placement with intrafetal vascular laser ablation for treatment of BPS with pleural effusion, complete regression of the lesion occurred more often with laser ablation (4 of 5 completely regressed) than with shunt placement (0 of 7 completely regressed) and gestational age at birth was lower with shunt placement (37.2 versus 39.1 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31928961\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delivery planning should be in conjunction with the pediatric staff (neonatology, pediatric surgery).

If hydrops develops after 32 weeks of gestation, early delivery is recommended, possibly with the use of ex-utero intrapartum therapy (EXIT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In EXIT, the fetus is partially delivered and intubated without clamping the umbilical cord. Uteroplacental blood flow and gas exchange are maintained by using inhalational agents to provide uterine relaxation and amnioinfusion to maintain uterine volume. This provides time for initiating extracorporeal membrane circulation to stabilize the infant, thus creating a controlled situation before resection of BPS in another operating room.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31928967\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTNATAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postnatal presentation, neonatal evaluation and care, complications, and management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchopulmonary-sequestration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchopulmonary sequestration&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31928973\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) typically has the appearance of a solid homogeneous mass with a systemic feeding vessel. It can be supradiaphragmatic, diaphragmatic, or infradiaphragmatic. When supradiaphragmatic, the most common location is the left basal chest. When infradiaphragmatic, it most likely occurs in the left suprarenal area. A hybrid of BPS and congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) should be suspected if ultrasound shows a mass with both solid and cystic components and a systemic feeding vessel. (See <a href=\"#H31928889\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H31928901\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of thoracic BPS included CPAM, congenital lobar emphysema, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. When intraabdominal, BPS can mimic adrenal hemorrhage, neuroblastoma and mesoblastic nephroma. (See <a href=\"#H31928913\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>BPS usually decreases in size in late pregnancy and prognosis is typically very good in the absence of hydrops. Large lesions can cause mediastinal shift and may be associated with hydrops, which has a poor prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H31928949\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial evaluation should include assessment for other congenital anomalies. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities is not increased above baseline in fetuses with BPS alone. Serial prenatal ultrasound examinations should be done to assess change in size of the lung mass and development of hydrops, although this is rare. (See <a href=\"#H31928949\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal course'</a> above and <a href=\"#H31928955\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal management'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-bronchopulmonary-sequestration/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">PRYCE DM.
