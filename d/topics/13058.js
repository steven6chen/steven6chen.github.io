Part of this response is directed against previously shielded epitopes of neutrophil granule proteins, leading to high-titer autoantibodies known as antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). The production of ANCA is one of the hallmarks of GPA and related forms of vasculitis. ANCA are directed against antigens present within the primary granules of neutrophils and monocytes; these autoantibodies produce tissue damage via interactions with primed neutrophils and endothelial cells.</p><p>ANCA are relatively specific for a group of disorders associated with vascular inflammation known as the ANCA-associated vasculitides: GPA, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss). Importantly, the term &quot;ANCA-associated vasculitis&quot; may be misleading since not all patients with clinical (and even histopathologically proven) diagnoses of GPA, MPA, or EGPA have ANCA.</p><p>Approximately 90 percent of patients with GPA have ANCA, although the percentage varies according to disease phenotype (patients with limited GPA are less likely to be ANCA positive). Among patients with MPA or EGPA, the percentages of patients who are ANCA positive are approximately 70 and 50 percent, respectively.</p><p>The most commonly identified and evaluated autoantigens in GPA are the following two proteins:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myeloperoxidase (MPO), which is the target in approximately 10 percent of patients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proteinase 3 (PR3), which is observed in 80 to 90 percent of patients</p><p/><p>ANCA directed against these antigens are known as MPO-ANCA and PR3-ANCA, respectively. </p><p>ANCA that target other antigens (eg, lactoferrin, cathepsin G, elastase, and bactericidal permeability-inhibiting protein) are frequently observed in immune-mediated disorders not typically associated with vasculitis (eg, ulcerative colitis). These other ANCA are of uncertain clinical and pathological significance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Upon immunofluorescence testing of serum using a weak fixative such as ethanol-fixed neutrophils as the substrate, sera containing PR3-ANCA cause a cytoplasmic pattern of neutrophil staining (a &quot;C-ANCA&quot; pattern). By contrast, MPO antigens migrate toward the nucleus, and sera containing MPO-ANCA lead to a perinuclear (&quot;P-ANCA&quot;) pattern of staining. For unclear reasons, sera from patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis usually contain either PR3-ANCA or MPO-ANCA, although, occasionally, both may be present.</p><p>The mechanisms by which ANCA arise and the role of these autoantibodies in causing disease remain unclear. One possibility is that these antibodies are epiphenomena (eg, the byproduct of more primary pathologic processes). However, in the majority of GPA cases and, particularly, in patients with generalized disease, ANCA appear, at minimum, to be involved directly in the widespread tissue damage that is the hallmark of this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of GPA and related vasculitides and the evidence supporting a pathogenetic role for ANCA will be reviewed here. The clinical spectrum of ANCA, the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and initial and maintenance therapy of GPA and MPA, and issues related to EGPA are discussed separately.

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a large cohort of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis in Europe revealed significant associations between patients with proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA serotype and genes encoding alpha-1 antitrypsin (SERPINA1, the endogenous inhibitor of PR3), PR3 itself, and HLA-DP. As for patients with myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA serotype, a significant association was identified with HLA-DQ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>In addition, the major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II allele HLA-DRB1-15 markedly increases the risk of PR3-associated ANCA vasculitis among African Americans and also contributes to disease risk among Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in a gene encoding a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) has been associated with both ANCA disease and rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Decreased local concentrations of alpha-1 antitrypsin caused by genetic polymorphisms or alterations in the enzyme's functionality induced by inflammation may therefore lead to <span class=\"nowrap\">protease/antiprotease</span> imbalance in the disease microenvironment. Although unproven, these events may be responsible for generating immunogenic forms of PR3 in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the frequency with which the first symptoms of GPA occur in the respiratory tract, exposure to noninfectious agents or toxins via the inhalational route is another possible inciting event. One such candidate is silica dust. The odds ratio of exposure to silica dust has been reported to be 4.4 times higher for patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis than in a comparison group of patients with kidney disease caused by lupus or other conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Another case-control study reported a similarly increased risk of ANCA vasculitis associated with exposure to silica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and a meta-analysis of six case-control studies found a significant association of silica exposure with the development of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Mercury and lead exposure have also been proposed as potential etiologic agents in the development of GPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>However, exact relationships between such environmental exposures and vasculitis are complicated by difficulties in obtaining reliable measurements of exposures, the likelihood of recall bias among patients who are diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis, and the choice of appropriate control groups. It is most likely that silica may serve at least as an adjuvant in patients with a predisposition to ANCA-associated vasculitis if it is not a primary trigger.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ANCA PRODUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The autoantibody response that produces antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) is probably generated against newly exposed epitopes (ie, cryptic sites) of the target autoantigen. Following the production of ANCA, the antibody response may generalize to the rest of the molecule or to other components of a macromolecular protein complex via the process of epitope spreading. With ANCA-associated vasculitis, these neoepitopes may arise at the sites of initial tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It also appears that patients harbor autoantibodies to different epitopes of myeloperoxidase (MPO) according to disease state, and some individuals also harbor naturally occurring autoantibodies with little or no pathogenic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Roughly 10 percent of patients lack both MPO-ANCA and proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA. A subset of such patients may harbor autoantibodies to other autoantigens; however, one study found that this subset of patients actually does have autoantibodies to MPO that are masked by its endogenous inhibitor, ceruloplasmin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoantigen complementarity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies are also generated against complementary peptides that are translated from the antisense RNA that encodes PR3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/11,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,28,29</a>]. This has led to the hypothesis that the antigen that initiates the cascade of immunologic events in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and related vasculitides is <strong>not</strong> the autoantigen or mimic but the complementary protein of the autoantigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Antibodies to these complementary proteins elicit anti-idiotypic antibodies that may react with the autoantigen or with other unrelated antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/11,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,30</a>]. As an example of the latter, antibodies generated to peptides complementary to PR3 also react with plasminogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This hypothesis was tested and verified in mice with anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease using a peptide complementary to the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

This hypothesis is supported by the finding that mononuclear cells have a significant role in this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/32-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) have much higher levels of CD4+<sup> </sup>T-cell and monocytic activation than do patients in remission or healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very high levels of the Th1 cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma are also observed in patients with active GPA.

This may contribute to increased T-cell activation in these patients.</p><p/><p>These findings suggest that IL-10, a known antagonist of monocyte activation, may inhibit the Th1 pathway in this disease by impairing the production of IL-12. In one study, for example, IL-10 treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from active GPA patients impaired the production of IFN-gamma in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Another finding that supports a likely role for cellular immunity in disease pathophysiology is the report of a study of five patients with very low cell surface expression of HLA class I molecules (caused by impaired expression of the transporter associated with antigen presentation genes) and with clinical and pathologic findings that resembled GPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Close examination of the granulomatous lesions revealed a large percentage of activated natural killer cells, a subpopulation of non-major histocompatability complex (MHC)-restricted mononuclear cells. Similar findings suggesting a prominent role for the Th1 lymphocyte pathway and mononuclear cells have been observed in patients with giant cell arteritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUTROPHIL ACTIVATION AND ANCA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A significant role for mononuclear cells in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) does not exclude an important role for antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). Since Th1 cytokines are effective stimuli of both neutrophils and monocytes, the production of ANCA may further enhance tissue injury by augmenting the damage caused by mononuclear cells.</p><p>The effects of ANCA are determined by the state of neutrophil activation. Proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO), located in the cytosol, may be relatively inaccessible to antibody binding. However, neutrophils &quot;primed&quot; with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as well as those undergoing apoptosis have enhanced expression of membrane-associated PR3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/2,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,37</a>]. In some individuals, a higher proportion of nonactivated neutrophils may express membrane-associated PR3, which may be a risk factor for vasculitis or for more severe manifestations of vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Genes that encode both PR3 and MPO have been shown to be abnormally upregulated in the peripheral neutrophils of patients with ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, possibly due to silencing defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. </p><p>Once neutrophils have been activated by priming, ANCA are able to bind relevant membrane-bound antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/38,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,43</a>], causing abnormal constitutive activation via either the crosslinking of MPO or PR3 or the binding of Fc receptors (FcRs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>].

In addition, primed neutrophils can adhere to and damage vascular endothelial cells and attract additional neutrophils to the site of damage, thereby creating an autoamplifying loop specific to the microenvironment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/37,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,54,55</a>].</p><p>Patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis have increased numbers of primed neutrophils in kidney biopsy specimens as well as increased expression of neutrophil-specific genes, paralleling the activity of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/49,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,57</a>]. In addition, persistent membrane expression of PR3 during periods of disease remission is associated with an increased risk of relapse in GPA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

One potential explanation for this observation is that an infection or other inflammatory process can lead to suprathreshold neutrophil (and, perhaps, monocyte) priming in those individuals with circulating ANCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Part of this response is directed against previously shielded epitopes of neutrophil granule proteins, leading to autoantibodies known as antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). Approximately 85 percent of patients with GPA have ANCA.
