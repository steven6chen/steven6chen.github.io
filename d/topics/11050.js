Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase normally generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. With metronidazole in the cellular environment, its nitro group acts as an electron sink, capturing electrons that would usually be transferred to hydrogen ions in this cycle.

Resistance is conferred through a reduction in pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity, which limits cellular uptake of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> and subsequent activation. The level of susceptibility and rate of drug uptake varies with the level of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity.

Under microaerophilic conditions, the bacteria may not be able to achieve the low redox potential necessary to activate the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metronidazole-an-overview/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. One report describes an association between metronidazole resistance and mutations in the <em>rdxA</em> gene of strains of <em>H. pylori</em> from both France and North Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metronidazole-an-overview/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Several reports have documented the development of resistance and subsequent clinical failure among patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> for <em>H. pylori</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metronidazole-an-overview/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. One study found that eradication rates among 196 patients with <em>H. pylori</em> infection were significantly lower for metronidazole-resistant strains than metronidazole-susceptible strains (67 versus 87 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metronidazole-an-overview/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> is associated with reduced transcription activity of the ferredoxin gene that results in decreased intracellular levels of ferredoxin and reduced pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase activity.

However, testing may be indicated for certain serious infections, including brain abscess, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, prosthetic device or vascular graft infection, and refractory or recurrent bacteremia. Testing might also be useful for persistent infections, for infections in which medical rather than surgical therapy is chosen, and for those in which prolonged therapy is anticipated. The Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly called the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, or NCCLS) has established a breakpoint of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for susceptibility, 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for intermediate susceptibility, and &ge;32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>.</p><p>The primary benefit of susceptibility testing is not to document susceptibility but rather to demonstrate unexpected resistance to an antimicrobial that is normally useful. Many clinicians will request anaerobic susceptibility testing from a reference laboratory when a patient has not responded clinically to an appropriate regimen directed at anaerobes. While awaiting the results of this testing, the patient should be changed to a different empiric therapy.</p><p>The clinical relevance of documented bacterial resistance in the setting of mixed anaerobic infections remains unclear. Other factors, including surgical debridement and the presence of comorbidities, significantly affect treatment outcomes. One prospective multicenter study assessed mortality, clinical treatment failure, and microbiologic persistence in 128 patients with <em>Bacteroides</em> bacteremia; susceptibility testing was performed on all isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metronidazole-an-overview/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. All of the outcome measures were worse for patients who received drugs that were not active against the organism compared with those with susceptible isolates (45 versus 16 percent 30-day mortality; 82 versus 22 percent clinical failure; and 47 versus 12 percent microbiologic persistence).

The typical disulfiram reaction causes flushing, tachycardia, palpitations, nausea, and vomiting. In a review of cases of disulfiram-like reactions in patients receiving metronidazole published between 1964 and 1999, eight cases were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metronidazole-an-overview/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Four of the cases were serious, including one fatality. Reported reactions included flushing, sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, skin pallor, acidosis, and death. However, the authors of the review noted that, in most of these cases, there were possible alternative explanations for the reactions that were not explored.</p><p>The mechanism of disulfiram-like reactions with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> is unknown; unlike disulfiram, metronidazole does not inhibit alcohol metabolism in the liver and does not increase acetaldehyde production. In a study of 12 healthy volunteers, no apparent adverse effects or increase in blood acetaldehyde levels were observed when six individuals received metronidazole 200 mg three times a day for five days followed by a single dose of ethanol 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> (approximately half a standard drink) compared with six individuals who ingested ethanol and placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metronidazole-an-overview/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. A study reported that rats receiving metronidazole and ethanol concomitantly had an increase in intracolonic acetaldehyde concentrations but not blood acetaldehyde concentrations compared with rats receiving ethanol alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metronidazole-an-overview/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The investigators suggested that this may be explained by metronidazole's impact on intestinal flora, with conversion to alcohol dehydrogenase-containing anaerobes; the mechanism of the disulfiram-like reaction with metronidazole may therefore be related to changes in gut flora with exposure to this antibiotic. Other studies have suggested that histamine reactions have been associated with similar intracolonic acetaldehyde concentrations, and investigators hypothesize that this could possibly lead to the disulfiram-like reaction with metronidazole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metronidazole-an-overview/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>While clear evidence of a disulfiram-like reaction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> is lacking, the manufacturer's product information recommends avoiding alcohol ingestion during metronidazole therapy and for at least 48 hours afterwards.

This reduced elimination may result in increased serum concentrations of phenytoin.
