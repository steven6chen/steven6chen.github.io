Vomiting is when you actually throw up. Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of a cancer treatment called chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the term doctors use to describe a group of medicines that kill cancer cells.</p><p>Not everyone who gets chemotherapy will have nausea and vomiting. Your doctor will tell you how likely it is that you will have these symptoms and how severe they might be.</p><p>When people have nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy, they usually feel better within 1 to 2 days. But some people have symptoms up to 3 to 4 days after their chemotherapy. This will depend on the type of chemotherapy medicines, the dose, and the treatment schedule.</p><p>Another cancer treatment, called radiation therapy, can also cause nausea and vomiting. Not everyone who gets radiation therapy will have nausea and vomiting. It will depend on the part of the body that is being treated, the dose of radiation, and whether the person gets chemotherapy at the same time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27993888\"><span class=\"h1\">Can nausea and vomiting be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your chemotherapy is the type that is likely to cause nausea and vomiting, your doctor will give you medicines before your treatment. These medicines can prevent nausea and vomiting. There are different medicines your doctor can use, and they come in different forms. They can come as a pill, skin patch, or tablet that melts on the tongue, or they can go into your vein. People can get 1 or more medicines.</p><p>People who are likely to have nausea and vomiting for a few days after chemotherapy might also take these medicines for 2 to 4 days after treatment.</p><p>If your radiation therapy can cause nausea and vomiting, your doctor will prescribe medicine for you to take before each day's treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27993895\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to manage my nausea and vomiting?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To manage your symptoms, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take the medicines your doctor prescribes to prevent nausea and vomiting, even if you feel fine. The best way to manage nausea and vomiting is to prevent it from happening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure to drink enough fluids so that you don't get dehydrated. Dehydration is when the body loses too much water. It can cause people to have dark yellow urine and feel thirsty, tired, dizzy, or confused.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat 5 or 6 small meals during the day after chemotherapy instead of 3 big ones, especially if you feel queasy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learn how much to eat or drink before your cancer treatment. Some people feel better when they eat or drink a small amount before treatment. Other people feel better if they don't have any food or drink beforehand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are feeling queasy, avoid foods that are spicy, greasy, or &quot;heavy.&quot; Instead, eat foods that are bland, such as crackers, rice, and toast. Other good food choices are soup broths, clear soda, tea, bananas, chicken (broiled or baked), oatmeal, yogurt (plain or vanilla), plain pasta, and popsicles.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wait at least 1 hour after your treatment before you eat or drink.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat and drink slowly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask someone else to cook your food, if the smell of food bothers you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try drinking ginger ale or taking over-the-counter ginger supplements to settle your stomach. Experts don't all agree on whether this works, but some people find it helpful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor about an alternative treatment called acupuncture, which might be helpful for some people.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27993902\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are unable to keep any food or drink in your stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomit up the medicines your doctor gives you to prevent nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27993909\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=complementary-and-alternative-medicine-treatments-cam-for-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Complementary and alternative medicine treatments (CAM) for cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
