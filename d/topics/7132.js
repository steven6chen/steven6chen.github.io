This often leads to infertility, which is a major quality of life concern. </p><p>With appropriate pretreatment planning and intervention, biologic parenthood is possible for many men and women who will lose reproductive function because of surgery or gonadotoxic treatment. This topic will discuss several measures for preserving fertility in young women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65144\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65144 \">table 3</a>) and men receiving potentially gonadotoxic agents. The approach to fertility preservation in healthy women who wish to delay child-bearing is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preserving options for women of advancing age&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1314548941\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to initiating potentially gonadotoxic therapy, physicians should discuss the risk of treatment-induced infertility and possible interventions to preserve fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Whenever possible, all patients with newly diagnosed cancer should meet with a reproductive endocrine and infertility specialist if fertility is a concern, preferably before treatment. In a retrospective review of 303 women aged 40 years and younger with breast cancer, only 80 women (26 percent) had a documented fertility discussion with their physician, but of these women nearly 90 percent pursued further consultation for fertility preservation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This discussion should occur soon after diagnosis since some interventions to preserve fertility take time and could delay the start of treatment. Early referral to a reproductive endocrinologist can be useful. Advances in chemotherapy have led to development of less gonadotoxic treatment regimens for many cancers, such as Hodgkin lymphoma. </p><p>Fertility preservation requires individualization. The optimal approach depends upon the type of gonadotoxic treatment (radiation versus chemotherapy), time available, patient age, the specific disease, whether the patient has a partner, costs, and long-term issues (storage and use of frozen gametes or embryos). Our approach to decision-making in patients with cancer is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55848\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef55848 \">algorithm 1</a>). The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) have published similar recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>In addition to the current topic, the following topics may be useful for patient counseling:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-failure-due-to-anticancer-drugs-and-radiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian failure due to anticancer drugs and radiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-cytotoxic-agents-on-gonadal-function-in-adult-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of cytotoxic agents on gonadal function in adult men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-male-infertility#H439088659\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of male infertility&quot;, section on 'Drugs and radiation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infertility-and-pregnancy-outcome-in-cancer-survivors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infertility and pregnancy outcome in cancer survivors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Patients undergoing cancer treatment may be eligible for discounted rates for fertility preservation interventions (eg, <a href=\"http://www.livestrong.org/we-can-help/fertility-services/&amp;token=PDFlNG2fhvHgWoCVpaEyNhmVVYxyEW+yPB2MUJ4fI4ZimZ0YFmqa/PBFiy/3jbAsBXqwB99VOA9XutnXktsj/w==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7440\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">LIVESTRONG fertility</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS TO PRESERVE FERTILITY IN WOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no large randomized clinical trials evaluating the majority of the interventions described below, nor are there long-term follow-up studies assessing the possible impacts of fertility treatment on cancer survivors. Many oncologists remain cautious about the use of traditional assisted reproductive technology (ART) in women with estrogen-dependent malignancies, since ART involves ovarian stimulation and results in high estrogen levels. </p><p>The presence of cancer probably does not affect ovarian reserve or responsiveness to gonadotropins prior to gonadotoxic therapy, but data are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CRYOPRESERVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryopreservation of embryos is a proven effective technique for preserving reproductive capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; cryopreserved thawed embryos are used in about 20 percent of all ART cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Cryopreservation of mature oocytes is also a proven technique, while cryopreservation of immature oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and ovarian tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] are promising approaches with reports of live births but remain investigational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Cryopreservation of the whole ovary with an intact pedicle and vascular supply is also investigational and has not yet resulted in a live birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Cryopreserved embryos and oocytes can be frozen for many years and remain viable. Frozen embryos survive the freeze-thaw process better than unfertilized oocytes (&gt;90 percent survival versus 50 to 70 percent survival). In one experienced center, the live-birth rate in patients who used frozen oocytes for in vitro fertilization (IVF) was approximately 21 percent versus 60 percent for patients undergoing IVF with fresh oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, cryopreservation of an embryo is preferable to oocyte cryopreservation, when possible. Donor sperm purchased from a commercial sperm bank may be required, if acceptable to the patient. </p><p>However, cryopreservation of embryos or oocytes does not guarantee preservation of fertility because chromosomal abnormalities are present in some oocytes, even in young women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Embryo</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embryo cryopreservation is a well-established technique for storing surplus embryos of patients undergoing IVF procedures. Because more than one embryo is often transferred, the percentage of frozen-thawed embryo transfers resulting in a live birth approaches the fecundity rate in natural conception and varies from 22 to 35 percent, depending on the age of the mother [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

In contrast to cryopreservation of embryos and sperm, oocyte cryopreservation is technically more challenging since oocytes contain more water and thus are more sensitive to cryoinjury from formation of ice crystals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The meiotic spindle, cytoskeleton, cortical granules, and zona pellucidae are the structures particularly at risk from freezing. However, by using special freezing techniques, approximately 70 percent of cryopreserved oocytes survive the freeze-thaw process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>] and possibly as many as 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>In randomized trials, the pregnancy rate with <span class=\"nowrap\">cryopreserved/warmed</span> mature oocytes was generally similar to that with fresh oocytes, although these trials were largely limited to donor oocyte populations and infertile couples with supernumerary oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>]. Two large observational studies reported acceptable success rates but lower than with fresh oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Based on these data, in 2013, the Practice Committees of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) concluded that mature oocyte cryopreservation is a reasonable option for preservation of fertility when medically indicated and embryo cryopreservation is not possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorsed this opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. When mature oocytes are collected and frozen, issues regarding ovarian stimulation (time constraints, high estrogen levels) discussed above also apply. </p><p>The two methods of cryopreservation are the &quot;slow-freeze&quot; technique and vitrification (conversion of water to a solid without formation of ice crystals by using a very &ldquo;fast freeze&rdquo; and cryoprotectants). Vitrification appears to be more successful than slow-freezing, but more trials are needed to establish whether one method is clearly superior to the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. In a 2013 meta-analysis of the two methods that used individual patient data from 10 studies (2265 cycles from 1805 patients), vitrification was associated with a significantly higher rate of oocyte survival (85 versus 65 percent), fertilization (79 versus 74 percent), and implantation than slow-freezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The authors also defined the probability of live birth based on a woman&rsquo;s age, the type of freezing, the number of eggs <span class=\"nowrap\">frozen/thawed,</span> and the number of embryos transferred that were generated from frozen-thawed oocytes, and subsequently developed an egg-freezing success probability calculator based on this information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Compared with conventional ovarian stimulation and retrieval of mature oocytes, advantages include the avoidance of large doses of gonadotropins and their associated risks and high costs, as well as avoidance of time constraints and exposure of estrogen-sensitive tumors to high estrogen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In addition, immature oocytes are expected to be more resistant to cryoinjury than mature oocytes since they do not contain a metaphase spindle. </p><p>However, the implantation rate per embryo transferred (5.5 to 21.6 percent) is significantly lower and early pregnancy loss per embryo transferred is higher than in conventional IVF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Patients who require immediate gonadotoxic treatment and prepubertal girls are potential candidates for this approach. When compared with embryo cryopreservation, advantages include that neither ovarian stimulation nor a partner are needed and that implanted ovarian tissue can continue to produce hormones. However, return of ovarian function after ovarian tissue transplantation appears to be more likely when fresh, rather than frozen-thawed grafts, are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>].

The patient had a right oophorectomy performed when she was 13 years 11 months prior to a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for sickle cell disease. At 23 years of age the cryopreserved ovarian tissue fragments were grafted onto the residual left ovary, into the right peritoneal bursa, and into the subcutaneous tissue. Menses resumed five months post-transplantation. Two years later she conceived and delivered a healthy male infant. Lastly, one birth has been reported to a woman whose ovary was removed at the age of 9, before the onset of puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The woman had her right ovary removed prior to undergoing a hematopoietic cell transplant to treat beta thalassemia. After 13 years in storage, the ovary was transplanted back in fragments &ndash; four were secured to her left ovary and one was attached to the side of her uterus. The woman conceived through IVF using eggs produced by the transplanted ovarian tissue. From a fertility standpoint, this should not come as a surprise because the ovary, as an organ, has matured by birth and is able to provide adult functions once the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is activated. Moreover, since ovarian reserve and quality are higher in younger individuals, one would expect even higher success rates in the prepubertal population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47385146\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Edinburgh criteria are strict selection criteria that have been proposed for selecting candidates for ovarian cryopreservation.

For example, some patients over 35 have sufficient ovarian reserve for fertility despite their age and some patients&nbsp;under age 35 may desire future childbearing even though they already have children. In addition, women under age 35 with good ovarian reserve immediately post-cancer therapy may have to delay childbearing and thus incur the risk of age-related decline&nbsp;in ovarian reserve when they attempt to become pregnant. Lastly, technological advances over time may also improve success rates in women with diminished ovarian reserve at the time of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/36,95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,95,96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12480896\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraindications and risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian tissue preservation is not an option for women with ovarian cancer or at high risk of developing ovarian cancer.

These women are offered prophylactic oophorectomy (usually at the completion of childbearing) to decrease the risk of developing ovarian cancer or as a part of a treatment plan for breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. They are not good candidates for cryopreservation of ovarian tissue, given their increased risk of developing ovarian cancer and the relatively high incidence of occult ovarian cancer (2 to 18.5 percent) in BRCA carriers. However, it has been hypothesized that if ovarian tissue is frozen when the woman is very young and at very low risk of ovarian cancer, cryopreservation of ovarian tissue may still be considered. This approach has not been tested. If ovarian tissue is cryopreserved for reimplantation, a detailed histological analysis of the ovarian cortical pieces is mandatory but may not completely rule out the presence of ovarian cancer.

However, for women in whom cryopreservation procedures are not an option (due to access, timing, cancer-specific reasons, or patient issues), some clinicians offer GnRH agonist treatment with the goal of preserving ovarian function. However, the patient must understand that this treatment is of unproven benefit for fertility preservation, cannot replace established methods such as oocyte or embryo cryopreservation, and has theoretical risks. In contrast, GnRH agonists are used for the reduction of meno-metrorrhagia.</p><p>The efficacy of GnRH therapy for fertility preservation is difficult to assess because many studies have used unreliable or non-suitable surrogate outcomes. In addition, most of the studies have assessed the treatment in women with different types of diseases, as discussed below. The ultimate measurement of fertility is live birth rate. However, the number of live births in these studies is often small and statistical assessment is limited by sample size. Other markers associated with reproduction are often reported, but these surrogate outcomes are not necessarily predictive of live birth rate. For example, resumption of menses is a poor predictor of fertility because women can resume menses but remain infertile. In addition, these studies do not report on the regularity of menses. In young women, irregular menses is a more common symptom of ovarian insufficiency than permanent amenorrhea. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels change daily and vary across cycles and cannot be compared unless they are measured on day 2 or 3 of menstrual cycle which the studies failed to do. Anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) levels and antral follicle counts (AFC) are better predictors of ovarian reserve. Studies that utilized AMH and AFC did not report any benefit of GnRH agonists to preserve ovarian reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/123-125\" class=\"abstract_t\">123-125</a>]. </p><p>As an example, 129 lymphoma patients were randomly assigned women to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triptorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triptorelin</a> plus norethisterone (GnRHa group) or norethisterone alone (control group) during chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. Ovarian function and fertility were reported after two, three, four, and five to seven years of follow-up.

Of the 67 women with complete data, the AMH and FSH levels were similar for both groups. Subsequently, the pregnancy rates were also similar, at 53 percent and 43 percent for the GnRHa and control groups. In this long-term analysis, GnRHa did not preserve ovarian reserve or fertility.</p><p>The mechanism by which GnRH agonists could protect fertility is unclear. GnRH agonists suppress ovarian function and therefore have been theorized to protect the ovary in the setting of a toxic insult such as chemotherapy. However, the ovarian follicles are still exposed to these DNA damaging agents even though the ovarian hormone production is suppressed. As primordial follicles do not express gonadotropin receptors, it is unclear how GnRH agonist therapy would enhance survival of these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H144699720\"><span class=\"h4\">Women with breast cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We offer women with breast cancer established cryopreservation therapies for fertility preservation.
