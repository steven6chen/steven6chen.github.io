These syndromes may affect any part of the nervous system from cerebral cortex to neuromuscular junction and muscle, damaging either one area or multiple areas.</p><p>This topic will review those syndromes affecting peripheral nerve and muscle. An overview of paraneoplastic syndromes and other paraneoplastic disorders are discussed separately.

Electrophysiologic studies help distinguish the syndrome from a sensory polyneuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination often reveals pleocytosis and elevated protein.</p><p>Most patients have small cell lung cancer (SCLC), anti-Hu antibodies, and, less commonly, anti-CRMP5 (CV2) or amphiphysin antibodies. Early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying tumor may result in neurologic stabilization or improvement; immunosuppressive therapy is usually ineffective. Subacute sensory neuronopathy is discussed separately.

Symptoms typically develop in patients with advanced disease, well after the diagnosis of malignancy has been made. </p><p>Patients are usually not very debilitated by their neurologic symptoms, which typically consist of mild to moderate distal symmetric sensorimotor deficits. This type of neuropathy rarely associates with paraneoplastic antibodies, and is slowly progressive, with weakness a late occurrence.</p><p>By contrast, patients with paraneoplastic antibodies (eg, CRMP5) develop a more rapidly progressive sensorimotor neuropathy; these antibodies usually associate with SCLC or thymoma. Electrophysiologic studies show axonal-neuronal or mixed axonal-demyelinating features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Electrophysiologic studies show both demyelination and axonal degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The neuropathy is often the presenting feature and may initially be confused with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Treatment of POEMS syndrome can be associated with improvement of the neuropathy, although this improvement usually occurs with a delay of months.

In patients without POEMS syndrome, the neuropathy is usually sensory without pain. Electrophysiologic studies show mild axonal loss and, in approximately half of patients, signs of demyelination. Patients with concurrent POEMS syndrome usually have a more severe sensorimotor neuropathy with moderate axonal loss and more frequent demyelination. Although patients often have symptomatic improvement with treatment of Castleman disease, they usually relapse and progress.

Patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">WM/LPL</span> may develop a predominantly demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy, which presents with sensory deficits in the feet, followed by weakness and foot drop with an abnormal gait. Involvement of the upper extremities occurs in the later stages of the disease. In some patients, the IgM paraprotein has reactivity against myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) or ganglioside GM1 that likely plays a pathogenic role.

For those with moderate to severe neuropathy, a rituximab combination regimen (eg, rituximab plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a>) may result in more rapid improvement. Therapeutic plasmapheresis is indicated in patients with neurologic symptoms related to hyperviscosity but is not considered useful for long-term management of neuropathy.

Autonomic dysfunction is associated with a variety of symptoms, including, among others, orthostatic hypotension, dry mouth, erectile dysfunction, sphincter incontinence, gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and cardiac arrhythmias that can lead to sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Signs of sympathetic hyperactivity, such as excessive spontaneous sweating, may occur as a true paraneoplastic phenomenon or from local infiltration of sympathetic nerves by the tumor.

Patients may have an ocular presentation, with weakness of the eyelids and extraocular muscles causing ptosis and diplopia, or a generalized presentation characterized by fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness with or without ocular involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 75 percent of patients have thymic disease, most of whom have thymic hyperplasia, but approximately 15 percent have a thymic epithelial tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Myasthenia gravis has occasionally been associated with other tumors (small cell lung cancer [SCLC], thyroid, and breast cancers, and Hodgkin lymphoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

These antibodies are pathogenic and reversibly disrupt the function of the neuromuscular junction. Patients with thymoma often have additional antibodies against skeletal muscle proteins such as titin or ryanodine.</p><p>Approximately 40 percent of patients without AChR antibodies have antimuscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSk) antibodies, and a smaller percentage have antibodies to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP4). Patients with MuSk antibodies may have thymic abnormalities but rarely have thymoma, while a relationship with LRP4 antibodies remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. MuSk is a protein essential in clustering AChR at the neuromuscular junction; antibody-mediated disruption of MuSk results in symptoms of myasthenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Antibodies other than those to the AChR or MuSk do not appear to play a direct role in producing the muscle weakness.

Less dramatic shoulder girdle weakness eventually occurs. The motor weakness tends to progress in a caudocranial direction and to be associated with decreased or absent reflexes. Less common presenting symptoms in LEMS include generalized weakness, myalgias and muscle stiffness, and upper extremity weakness. Autonomic symptoms, consisting of erectile dysfunction in men or dry mouth, are frequent findings in LEMS. When oculobulbar symptoms occur in LEMS, they are typically less severe than in myasthenia gravis.

The presence of antibodies against SOX1 in patients with LEMS predicts the presence of a SCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As is often seen with paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes, the neurologic symptoms usually precede the detection of the neoplasm. Some patients have combined paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and LEMS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-cerebellar-degeneration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In general, effective antitumor treatment usually results in neurologic improvement. Symptomatic therapies for LEMS include medications that increase the amount of acetylcholine available at the postsynaptic membrane. These are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guanidine</a>, 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP), and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a>. Immunologic therapies for LEMS include plasma exchange, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, and oral immunosuppressive agents. These agents are thought to dampen the aberrant immune response that causes LEMS by reducing the antibodies directed at the VGCC in the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction.</p><p>The approach to the treatment of LEMS is discussed in detail elsewhere.

However, since the diagnosis of a tumor is sometimes made many years before or after the diagnosis of polymyositis, the association may represent a coincidental occurrence rather than a tumor-induced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In most cases this is not disabling. Exceptions include patients with anti-CRMP5 antibodies, which associate with more rapidly progressing symptoms and with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or thymoma. Patients with a paraproteinemia related to a variety of plasma cell dyscrasias may also develop a disabling neuropathy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Chronic sensorimotor neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute sensorimotor radiculoneuropathy identical to the Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) may occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome, usually in association with Hodgkin lymphoma. Treatment and prognosis is similar to that for GBS that is not associated with cancer. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Acute sensorimotor radiculoneuropathy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraneoplastic autonomic dysfunction manifests with a variety of symptoms, including dry mouth, blurry vision, erectile dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension, gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and cardiac arrhythmias that can lead to sudden death. When this syndrome occurs along with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, it is often associated with SCLC and anti-Hu antibodies. By contrast, when it occurs as a predominant or isolated syndrome, it may associate with neuronal acetylcholinesterase receptor (AChR) antibodies, usually in the absence of an underlying cancer. It is often treatment resistant. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraneoplastic peripheral nerve vasculitis typically presents with painful, asymmetric sensorimotor deficits resembling a multifocal mononeuropathy. Biopsy demonstrates the vasculitis. Immunotherapy and antitumor treatment may improve symptoms.

Electromyography (EMG) shows fibrillation, fasciculations, and doublet, triplet, or multiplet single-unit (myokymic) discharges that have a high intraburst frequency. Thymoma, SCLC, and Hodgkin lymphoma are the most commonly associated neoplasms. A small subgroup of patients develops antibodies against contactin-associated protein-like 2 (Caspr2). Treatment with plasma exchange or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> is usually of benefit.
