It is the most common primary antibody defect in humans.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe IgA deficiency refers to serum levels below 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> which is the lower limit of detection for most assays.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial IgA deficiency refers to serum levels above 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> but below the lower limit of normal (ie, lower than 2 standard deviations below the age-adjusted mean).</p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations of sIgAD range from an asymptomatic laboratory finding to recurrent infections and autoimmune disease. This topic reviews the management and prognosis of patients with sIgAD. The clinical features, pathophysiology, and diagnosis are discussed separately.

A more detailed discussion of the drugs associated with IgA deficiency is found elsewhere.

Specifically, oral polio vaccine, Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG), and yellow fever should <strong>not</strong> be given, especially in those with associated immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients in whom the diagnosis of sIgAD is preliminary because an immune evaluation is incomplete, a more cautious approach is warranted and live local vaccines (eg, intranasal influenza and live rotavirus) should also be avoided until the evaluation is complete. These additional restrictions are warranted because IgA deficiency can be a finding in other more severe immunodeficiencies (eg, ataxia-telangiectasia), which preclude a wider array of live vaccines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other vaccines, such as the pneumococcal vaccine, are specifically recommended for patients with sIgAD to help reduce the risk of sinopulmonary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17790957\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with partial IgA deficiency are asymptomatic. These individuals require no specific treatment beyond education. Patients with severe sIgAD are less likely to be entirely asymptomatic, although this is still possible. If an asymptomatic person with severe sIgAD has received blood products at any point, then <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> should be checked for anti-IgA antibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17790888\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus about how asymptomatic patients should be monitored. The approach of the author and editors of UpToDate is to ask patients to return at periodic intervals to review the frequency of infections, as well as a thorough review of systems. We also suggest checking levels of IgA, IgG, and IgM periodically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic patients with sIgAD are managed according to the disorder present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Sinopulmonary infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common clinical manifestation of symptomatic sIgAD is recurrent sinopulmonary infections or recurrent otitis media in younger children, which may impact the patient's full participation in life (school, job, social functioning). Patients may benefit from several interventions to prevent or reduce the frequency of these illnesses, such as treatment of concomitant rhinitis or asthma, prophylactic antibiotics, or if these measures are insufficient, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Treat concomitant disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The finding of sIgAD in a patient with recurrent infections does not exclude other causes of sinopulmonary infections. Patients with sIgAD may also have chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic <span class=\"nowrap\">rhinitis/asthma,</span> or chronic nonallergic rhinitis. These other conditions could be more important causes of recurrent infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-clinical-manifestations-pathophysiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic rhinosinusitis: Clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic nonallergic rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with continued infections despite management of underlying conditions, a six-month course of daily prophylactic antibiotics can be instituted. Maintenance prophylactic antibiotic may be continued if the initial course is successful. It may also be possible to administer these antibiotics only during the winter, depending upon the patient's historic pattern of infections. The use of prophylactic antibiotics in immunodeficiency disorders is reviewed in more detail separately.

In our experience, only a small minority of patients with sIgAD requires immune globulin to control infections. This therapy does not replete IgA in the serum or secretions, but rather provides pathogen-specific IgG pooled from the general adult population.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Immune globulin</a> replacement may be administered intravenously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68573 \">table 1</a>) or subcutaneously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59390\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59390 \">table 2</a>). A potential complication of intravenous therapy in sIgA-deficient patients is the presence of anti-IgA antibodies that may cause anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. To reduce this risk, intravenous preparations with the lowest content of IgA should be utilized whenever possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68573 \">table 1</a>).

Indirect evidence in support of the role of anti-IgA antibodies includes the finding that these antibodies are more prevalent in patients with sIgAD who have experienced anaphylaxis compared with those who have not (76 compared with 22 percent in one study of approximately 200 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>There are two types of anti-IgA antibodies, which are IgG and IgE, and both may be implicated in adverse reactions to blood products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/7,8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,10,11</a>]. IgE anti-IgA is much less common than IgG anti-IgA. IgE anti-IgA was demonstrated in only 1 individual in a series of 46 IgA-deficient patients, and this individual had life-threatening anaphylaxis in response to intravenous gammaglobulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Despite these uncertainties, the diagnosis of IgA-related anaphylaxis is usually assumed if a patient who experiences infusion-related anaphylaxis has undetectable serum IgA and anti-IgA antibodies of either type can be detected.</p><p>Most patients with sIgAD do not form anti-IgA antibodies. These antibodies are usually only found in patients with undetectable serum IgA. Even among severely IgA-deficient individuals, antibodies to IgA are rare. In studies of blood donors, anti-IgA antibodies where detected in severely IgA-deficient patients at a frequency of approximately 1 in 1200 to 1600 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>].

However, a commercial assay is available for the detection of IgG against IgA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. There is no commercial test for IgE anti-IgA, but a positive test for the IgG isotype assumes that the patient might also be capable of producing IgE against IgA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24166158\"><span class=\"h4\">Indications for screening for anti-IgA antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest screening for anti-IgA antibodies in all patients with severe sIgAD and in patients with partial sIgAD (and other patients) who have experienced an infusion reaction to a blood product in the past. Screening for anti-IgA antibodies allows clinicians to identify patients at risk for infusion reactions and help these patients become informed about the potential risks of receiving blood products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24166165\"><span class=\"h4\">Preparation for future treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe sIgAD, either with or without positive screening tests for anti-IgA antibodies (as patients with negative screens can become sensitized over time), are advised to obtain a medical alert <span class=\"nowrap\">bracelet/necklace</span> inscribed with the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has sIgAD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is at risk for an allergic reaction to any injected plasma-containing blood products and testing for anti-IgA antibodies should be performed before such blood products are administered.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24166172\"><span class=\"h4\">Safe administration of blood products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All blood products should be used with caution in IgA-deficient patients, and appropriate staff and medication should be available to treat anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Patients who have already experienced an infusion reaction to plasma-containing blood products should be tested for anti-IgA antibodies prior to receiving any additional blood products. If positive, a strategy should be devised for safe administration of future blood products. The approach will differ depending upon the blood product needed. Consultation with a transfusion medicine specialist should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who require transfusions of red blood cells can receive cells that have been washed to remove as much of the contaminating IgA as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/13,14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,18</a>].

A case report described desensitization of a patient with sIgAD who experienced anaphylaxis to blood products, but subsequently required numerous infusions of various blood products in the context of liver transplant. The patient was successfully desensitized to a gammaglobulin preparation, which was then administered weekly to maintain the desensitized state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of selective IgA deficiency (sIgAD) is not well-studied, although studies have found the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe sIgAD in children usually persists, whereas partial sIgAD in children may resolve over time, particularly if no other primary immune disorder is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-iga-deficiency-management-and-prognosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H6475461\" class=\"local\">'Reactions to blood products'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe sIgAD appears to be a lasting condition, while partial sIgAD sometimes resolves, particularly in children. The risk of malignancy is moderately increased in adults with IgA deficiency. The prognosis of patients with sIgAD probably depends largely upon the presence and severity of associated disorders.
