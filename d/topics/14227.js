As a result, only about one-quarter of pregnant women in sub-Saharan African countries receive a full course of chemoprophylaxis and only about one-third use insecticide-treated mosquito nets, according to survey data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2373701627\"><span class=\"h2\">Travelers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant travelers should be advised to defer travel to areas where risk of acquiring malaria is high until after delivery, if feasible. Nonimmune pregnant women who cannot defer travel should take chemoprophylaxis. The agents of choice are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> (for travel to areas with chloroquine-sensitive malaria) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefloquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefloquine</a> (for travel to areas with chloroquine-resistant malaria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Benefits include fewer deliveries of low birthweight infants and less maternal anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) is the preferred approach because it is effective and more practical than widespread continuous prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The optimal antimalarial agent, dose, and frequency for IPTp depend on regional transmission intensity, drug resistance patterns, and HIV prevalence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2373701661\"><span class=\"h3\">Intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For pregnant women who live in areas with medium and high malaria transmission, we are in agreement with guidance issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy. The WHO advises administration of at least three doses of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for IPTp, ideally at each of three antenatal care visits in the second and third trimesters (per WHO guidance, these antenatal visits should occur at 24 to 26 weeks, 32 weeks, and 36 to 38 weeks of gestation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Ideally, each SP dose suppresses or clears asymptomatic infection from the placenta and provides up to six weeks of posttreatment prophylaxis. IPTp with SP also provides protection against adverse birth outcomes from sexually transmitted and reproductive tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>SP has shown to be an effective drug for IPT, although its benefit may be limited given the emergence of drug resistance. The broad anti-pathogen of SP effect may explain its efficacy in areas of high SP resistance.<strong> </strong>Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is a promising alternative agent for IPTp as discussed below.</p><p>The previous recommendation for only two doses of SP one month apart resulted in many missed opportunities for providing IPTp during antenatal care and close to the time of delivery, resulting in poorer pregnancy outcomes. In a 2013 systematic review and meta-analysis of IPTp trials that compared &ge;3-dose SP regimens with the standard 2-dose SP regimen, the &ge;3-dose SP regimens resulted in fewer low birthweight infants (risk ratio [RR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.94; <span class=\"nowrap\">134/1000</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">167/1000),</span> less moderate to severe maternal anemia (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.36-0.99; <span class=\"nowrap\">22/1000</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">36/1000),</span> and less placental malaria (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38-0.68; <span class=\"nowrap\">32/1000</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">63/1000)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>IPTp-related improvements in maternal and neonatal outcomes diminish as local drug resistance increases; there is no consensus as to the level of resistance at which SP-IPTp should be discontinued and an alternative regimen substituted. High SP resistance among <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> parasites (six resistance mutations in <em>DHFR</em> and <em>DHPS</em> genes) has been detected in a few discrete areas of eastern and southern Africa and appears to be eliminating previously observed pregnancy benefits. In a study among 880 pregnant women in Muheza, Tanzania, where SP resistance is 68 percent, SP-IPTp did not decrease the odds of placental malaria or increase mean maternal hemoglobin level or neonatal birthweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Despite this, a subsequent study that included 1222 pregnant women from six countries in eastern and southern Africa (with prevalence of <em>DHPS</em> resistance &gt;90 percent) noted that the use of SP-IPTp remained associated with increases in birthweight and maternal hemoglobin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The above findings underscore the need for additional research to identify effective alternative regimens; DP is a promising alternative drug to SP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large trial including 1546 Kenyan women randomized to receive intermittent preventive treatment with SP or DP, the prevalence of malaria infection at delivery was lower among those who received DP (3 versus 13 percent); compared with SP, IPT with DP reduced the incidence of clinical malaria during pregnancy by 84 percent (37.9 versus 6.1 episodes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Of note, DP requires daily dosing for three days (compared with a single dose for SP), limiting the ability for direct observation of therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent trial included 300 pregnant adolescents and women in Uganda (where SP resistance is widespread) who were randomized to receive IPT with SP (three doses), DP (three doses), or DP (monthly treatments starting as early as 16 weeks of gestation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The prevalence of histopathologically confirmed placental malaria was higher among those who received IPT with SP (50 percent) than those who received monthly DP or three doses of DP (27 and 34 percent, respectively). In addition, monthly DP treatment was superior to three-dose DP with regard to several outcomes, including adverse birth outcomes and the incidence of symptomatic malaria.</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefloquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mefloquine</a> is not used for IPTp because of adverse effects and poor tolerability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Dosing and adverse effects of SP are discussed separately.

ISTp involves screening pregnant women for malaria with a rapid diagnostic test at each antenatal visit, with antimalarial treatment reserved only for those with identified infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-malaria#H23056321\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of malaria&quot;, section on 'Rapid diagnostic tests'</a>.)</p><p>In a randomized trial from Ghana comparing standard IPTp, ISTp with SP, and ISTp with artesunate-amodiaquine, no significant difference in maternal severe anemia or low birthweight was noted among the three groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A subsequent trial conducted in four West African nations randomly assigned primigravid and secundigravid women to IPTp-SP or ISTp with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artemether-and-lumefantrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artemether-lumefantrine</a> (AL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. ISTp-AL was noninferior to IPTp-SP for prevention of the primary trial endpoints (low birthweight, maternal anemia, and placental malaria).</p><p>ISTp may be useful in areas of lower transmission where the prevalence of malaria in pregnancy is low. ISTp may also be of benefit in areas of high SP resistance if an alternative to SP is administered. Further studies are warranted from a diversity of endemic settings to establish the safety and efficacy of ISTp compared with IPTp.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2373701667\"><span class=\"h3\">Women infected with HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV-infected pregnant women who are not taking cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for opportunistic infections require more intensive IPTp dosing to reduce the risk of placental malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Among HIV-infected women in their first or second pregnancy, monthly administration of SP-IPTp resulted in less placental malaria and higher neonatal birth weights than a two-dose SP-IPTp regimen over the range of resistance tested (up to 39 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>HIV-infected pregnant women taking cotrimoxazole for prevention of opportunistic infections do not warrant intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) during pregnancy, since cotrimoxazole provides protection against HIV-related opportunistic infections and as well as malaria.

Mosquitoes capable of transmitting malaria infection (<em>Anopheles </em>species) usually feed at night; thus, women are advised to diminish exposure to these insects between dusk and dawn by remaining in screened areas whenever possible, using mosquito netting (ideally treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permethrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">permethrin</a>), covering exposed skin with clothing, and applying insect repellent. The recommendations for N,N-diethyl-metatoluamide (DEET) use in pregnant and lactating women do not differ from those for nonpregnant adults.

A 2006 Cochrane review of the impact of ITNs during pregnancy included four randomized trials from sub-Saharan Africa that compared use of ITNs with no nets and one trial from Thailand that compared use of ITNs with use of untreated nets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In the African trials, use of ITNs significantly reduced the risk of placental malaria in all pregnancies (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.98); in first through fourth pregnancies, ITNs reduced the risk of low birthweight (RR of 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98) and <span class=\"nowrap\">stillbirth/abortion</span> (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.97).

Safety and efficacy data to guide treatment are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-malaria-in-pregnant-women/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In general, newer drugs are more likely to be effective than older drugs (in part because of insufficient time for emergence of resistance), but fewer data are available on fetal safety.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-malaria-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of malaria in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of malaria involves chemoprophylaxis and mosquito avoidance. Pregnant travelers should defer travel to areas where there is a high risk of acquiring malaria, if feasible. For pregnant women who cannot defer travel or reside in malarious regions, we recommend chemoprophylaxis and mosquito avoidance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-malaria-infection-in-travelers#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of malaria infection in travelers&quot;, section on 'Pregnant travelers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal antimalarial agent, dose, and frequency for intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) depend on regional transmission intensity, drug resistance patterns, and HIV prevalence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For pregnant women residing in areas of medium and high malaria transmission, we recommend administration of IPTp (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (three doses given at 24 to 26 weeks, 32 weeks, and at 36 to 38 weeks) has been an effective drug for IPT, although its benefit may be limited given the emergence of drug resistance; dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is a promising alternative agent.

HIV-infected women not taking cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should receive monthly IPT with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. (See <a href=\"#H2373701633\" class=\"local\">'Women living in endemic areas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mosquito avoidance reduces the likelihood of malaria infection.
