In the United States, approximately 40 percent of women have sexual concerns and 12 percent report distressing sexual problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Female sexual dysfunction takes different forms, including lack of sexual desire, impaired arousal, inability to achieve orgasm, or pain with sexual activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Sexual dysfunction may be a lifelong problem or acquired later in life after a period of normal sexual functioning.</p><p>The epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation of female sexual dysfunction will be reviewed here. Management of female sexual dysfunction and evaluation and treatment of dyspareunia are discussed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of female orgasmic disorder are also discussed separately.

The female sexual response cycle is divided into four phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desire (libido) &ndash; desire to have sexual activity, including sexual thoughts, images, and wishes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arousal (excitement) &ndash; subjective sense of sexual pleasure accompanied by physiologic changes, including genital vasocongestion and increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orgasm &ndash; peaking of sexual pleasure and release of sexual tension, with rhythmic contractions of the perineal muscles and reproductive organs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resolution &ndash; muscular relaxation and a sense of general well-being following sexual activity</p><p/><p>This is a general framework for the sexual response cycle; however, for many women, the phases may vary in sequence, overlap, repeat, or be absent during all or some sexual encounters. As an example, for most women in long-term relationships, desire may not be present initially, but may increase in response to pleasurable activity. While it is helpful to know where in the sexual response cycle a problem occurs, many women have concerns that relate to multiple aspects of sexual response.</p><p>The sexual response cycle must also be understood within an interpersonal context. While desire may be an initiating factor for sexual activity, women are often motivated by other reasons, including a wish for emotional closeness and to strengthen a relationship with a partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Also, subjective satisfaction with the sexual experience may not require achieving all response phases, including orgasm.</p><p>The sexual pain disorders represent a discrete form of sexual dysfunction, often with specific causes and therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These include pelvic floor hypertonus (previously known as vaginismus) and other forms of dyspareunia, and are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the woman with sexual pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of sexual pain in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOCRINOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of estrogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Declining levels of estrogens in peri- and postmenopausal women have been associated with changes in sexual function. Hypoestrogenization results in reduction in both vulvovaginal lubrication and vasocongestion during sexual arousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], as well as vaginal atrophy and an increased likelihood of sexual pain. Symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy is now incorporated into the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, the new preferred term for the signs and symptoms associated with postmenopausal estrogen deficiency. These involve changes to the labia, vagina, urethra, and bladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The syndrome may include symptoms of genital dryness, burning, and irritation; sexual symptoms of diminished lubrication and pain; and urinary symptoms of urgency, dysuria, and recurrent urinary tract infections. Women may present with some or all of the signs and symptoms, which must be bothersome and should not be better accounted for by another diagnosis. The impact of hypoestrogenism on sexual function was illustrated in a longitudinal cohort study in which over 400 perimenopausal women were monitored with hormone levels and a sexuality questionnaire annually for up to eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Declining levels of estradiol were associated with decreases in libido and sexual responsivity, while no aspect of sexual functioning correlated with any of the androgens measured (total testosterone, free testosterone index, and DHEA-S). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Role of androgens'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of androgens</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Androgen production &ndash; The major androgens in women, as in men, are dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nearly all (98 percent) of circulating testosterone is protein-bound (mainly to sex-hormone binding globulin [SHBG] or albumin). The unbound, or free, fraction is biologically active; binding to albumin is weak, so this portion may also be bioavailable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, factors that increase SHBG concentrations (eg, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, or oral estrogen therapy) will decrease free testosterone. Transdermal estrogen therapy (in physiologic doses) does not affect SHBG levels and has minimal effects on free testosterone concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although ovarian and adrenal androgen production decrease throughout a woman's life, ovarian testosterone production remains relatively constant through the transition to natural menopause. After surgical menopause (ie, bilateral oophorectomy), however, testosterone levels decrease by approximately 50 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Androgen physiology in women is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of androgen deficiency and therapy in women&quot;, section on 'Androgen production'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effect on sexual function &ndash; It has been proposed that androgens play a role in female sexual function; however, the magnitude of this role is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The assertion that low androgen levels are a primary factor in female sexual problems is based on the role of androgens in male sexuality and on the results of trials in which supraphysiologic doses of exogenous androgens exerted a positive influence on some aspects of female sexuality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A randomized trial of intramuscular testosterone administration in postmenopausal women demonstrated that significant increases in sexual function occur only with supraphysiologic dosing. Women were assigned to receive weekly intramuscular injections of placebo or testosterone (3, 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg) for 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Compared with placebo, significant increases in libido and sexual frequency were seen only in women assigned to the highest testosterone group, in which circulating testosterone levels approached the lower limit of normal for men. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, in studies that measured hormone levels and sexual function in women, the correlation between androgen levels and sexual function is either weak or nonexistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/7,13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13-18</a>]. As an example, in a study of over 2900 women aged 42 to 52 years, no association was found between sexual function and levels of testosterone, DHEA-S, and SHBG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In another population-based study of over 1400 randomly selected women aged 18 to 75 years, no single androgen level was predictive of low sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, while women have lower ovarian androgen levels after surgical versus natural menopause, the majority of studies on the effect of bilateral oophorectomy on sexual function do not identify a significant increase in sexual dysfunction postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Further, women with high androgen levels due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) do not exhibit beneficial sexual effects. In fact, sexual function in women with PCOS appears to be similar or worse compared with women without PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. A negative influence on sexuality in PCOS may be due to changes in self-image from PCOS-related hirsutism, obesity, and acne [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adrenal insufficiency may be a special case, as some data suggest that young women with this condition may show improvement in sexuality with the addition of DHEA to their replacement regimen, although studies demonstrate inconsistent effects of DHEA on female sexuality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. DHEA does not appear to improve sexual function in women without adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The best data supporting a role for testosterone in female sexual function come from a large series of controlled clinical trials of physiologic transdermal (patch) testosterone treatment in over 1500 surgically and naturally menopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) (low sexual desire associated with distress) and no other etiologic factors. Satisfying sexual activity, desire, arousal and response increased significantly in women receiving testosterone compared with those receiving placebo. Although these studies do not prove that low testosterone causes sexual dysfunction, they support a role for testosterone in female sexuality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In contrast, two randomized trials reported by the manufacturer of a topical testosterone gel (LibiGel) showed no significant increase in sexual desire or the number of sexually-satisfying events compared with placebo, despite achieving testosterone blood levels similar to those seen in clinical trials of the testosterone patch</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual complaints are reported by approximately 40 percent of women worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/1,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,34-36</a>]. This was demonstrated in a study conducted in 29 countries among almost 14,000 women aged 40 to 80 years responding to a questionnaire in person or on the telephone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The most commonly reported types of dysfunction were low sexual desire (26 to 43 percent) and inability to reach orgasm (18 to 41 percent). For all categories of sexual problems, prevalence was highest in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) and lowest in Northern Europe (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom).</p><p>Most studies have not assessed whether sexual issues are associated with personal distress, a key requirement for diagnosis of female sexual dysfunction (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> below). In addition, some studies still exclude women who are not in sexual relationships, so that women for whom sexual dysfunction is a barrier to forming sexual relationships are not assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The largest United States study of female sexual dysfunction, Prevalence of Female Sexual Problems Associated with Distress and Determinants of Treatment Seeking (PRESIDE), did measure personal distress and included women who were not currently in a sexual relationship; over 30,000 women responded to validated questionnaires regarding low desire, low arousal, and orgasm difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The prevalence of any of these three sexual problems (with or without distress) was 43 percent; 22 percent reported sexually related personal distress and 12 percent attributed distress to a specific type of sexual problem (eg, desire).</p><p>Low desire was the most common sexual problem in women, reported by 39 percent of women and associated with distress in 10 to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Low arousal (26 percent) and orgasm difficulties (21 percent) were slightly less prevalent, and were both associated with distress in 5 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Five percent of women reported both low desire and another sexual problem; 2 percent reported all three problems.</p><p>Data regarding sexual pain disorders are often not reported by studies of female sexual dysfunction, thus, there are fewer data about the prevalence of these conditions. In studies of over 1000 women, reported rates of pain during sex ranged from 14 to 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/34,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,38</a>]. In postmenopausal women, genitourinary syndrome of menopause with bothersome vaginal dryness results in uncomfortable sexual activity in approximately 40 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of sexual dysfunction is often multi-factorial and may include psychological problems such as depression or anxiety, conflict within the relationship, fatigue, stress, lack of privacy, issues relating to prior physical or sexual abuse, medications, or physical problems that make sexual activity uncomfortable, such as endometriosis or genitourinary syndrome of menopause.</p><p>Similarly, the presence of any serious medical condition is likely to impair sexual function due not only to the condition itself, but also to associated impact on psychological well-being. In a study of sexuality in women aged 57 to 85 years, physical health was more strongly associated with sexual problems than age alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In the PRESIDE study, poor self-assessed health was a significant correlate of distressing sexual problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3080620282\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatigue and stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not often studied, fatigue and stress have a major impact on libido for women. After the birth of a child, in addition to physical changes, fatigue and meeting the demands of an infant significantly decrease sexual interest for many women. At midlife, beyond the endocrine changes (described below), women are often challenged by the needs of elderly parents and adolescent children, career demands, and partners' midlife changes. The typical improvement in sexual interest and response on vacation reflects the negative impact of fatigue and stress on female sexuality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Age and menopause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of age on sexual function in women is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/1,16,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,34</a>]. In the PRESIDE study, presence of distressing sexual problems were age related; although all sexual problems increased with advancing age, the prevalence of a sexual problem associated with distress was highest in women aged 45 to 64 years (15 percent), lowest in women 65 years or older (9 percent), and intermediate in women aged 18 to 44 years (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When specific types of sexual dysfunction were assessed, rates of low desire associated with distress followed an age-related pattern similar to that for any sexual problem.</p><p>In contrast, in the National Health and Social Life Survey study in which 1749 women were interviewed, prevalence of sexual problems tended to decrease with increasing age, except for reports of trouble lubricating. Of note, only women aged 18 to 59 years with a sexual partner within the past year were included in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In a national probability study of over 1500 women aged 57 to 85 years, sexual activity declined with age, although 40 percent of women aged 65 to 74 years and 17 percent of those over 75 years reported activity. About half of women studied reported a sexual problem, although sexually related personal distress was not assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Menopausal status correlates closely with age, and the likelihood of the onset of sexual disorders with menopause appears to depend on the specific type of sexual dysfunction. Vaginal dryness and dyspareunia are consistently increased after menopause, related primarily to the lack of estrogen on vaginal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Postmenopausal women are also more likely to report low desire or arousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/1,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,43,44</a>].</p><p>In addition, greater impairment of sexual function may be associated with surgical versus natural menopause. In natural menopause, estrogen levels are low, but ovarian androgen output is maintained at premenopausal levels (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Role of androgens'</a> above). In the PRESIDE study, surgical, but not natural, menopause was associated with orgasm problems and the decrease in arousal was greater in women after surgical menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similarly, in one retrospective study of women following hysterectomy, women who had bilateral oophorectomy reported significantly decreased sexual satisfaction postoperatively, despite estrogen treatment, compared to women who had their ovaries preserved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. On the other hand, this result was not observed in a subsequent prospective study that found sexuality was unaltered postoperatively in women following hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Further, a cross-sectional study of over 1000 women found no difference in sexual ideation in women age 57 years or older who had undergone oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Hormonal changes alone may not account directly for changes in sexual function. Menopausal symptoms may have an independent adverse effect on sexuality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/1,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,47</a>]. As an example, in a study of 341 peri- and postmenopausal women, common menopausal symptoms, including night sweats, sleep disturbances, and mood changes, were associated with diminished libido [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Other life changes that occur at the time of menopause may also supersede the effect of hormonal changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/7,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,44</a>]. This was illustrated in a study of 200 women aged 51 to 61 years that found menopause had a smaller impact on sexual functioning than overall health, mental health, or having a new partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric and neurologic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression is present in 17 to 26 percent of women who complain of low sexual desire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Both depression and anxiety were significant correlates of distressing sexual problems in the PRESIDE study. Anxiety and psychotic disorders are also risk factors for sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Benzodiazepines have been reported to be associated with sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. Selective serotonin receptor inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause low desire and difficulty with orgasm in women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antipsychotic medications are associated with sexual dysfunction in both men and women. These medications inhibit dopamine, which may serve as a central neuromodulator of sexual function.

Women on hormonal contraceptives are more likely to be in a sexual relationship and sexual activity may be facilitated by confidence in the ability to be sexually active without becoming pregnant. Conversely, libido may decrease with increased duration of a relationship, and this may be a cofactor in decreased libido in women on hormonal contraceptives. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Relationship factors'</a> below.)</p><p>In terms of physiology, study of the effect of OCs on sexual function derives from the interest in the role of androgens on female sexuality. OCs suppress ovarian testosterone levels via suppression of pituitary LH secretion. In addition, the estrogen component of the pill increases SHBG levels. The net result is a decrease in free testosterone concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/93,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,104</a>] (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Role of androgens'</a> above). However, it remains unproven that any effect of OCs on sexual function is caused by the decrease in androgen activity. In fact, in OC users who complain of decreased libido, treatment with exogenous androgens does not improve desire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p>Variations in OC formulations do not appear to influence sexual effects.

The major categories are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Female sexual <span class=\"nowrap\">interest/arousal</span> disorder</strong> (this includes the former categories hypoactive sexual desire disorder and female sexual arousal disorder) &ndash; Lack of, or significantly reduced, sexual <span class=\"nowrap\">interest/arousal,</span> as manifested by at least three of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Absent/reduced</span> interest in sexual activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Absent/reduced</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">sexual/erotic</span> thoughts or fantasies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">No/reduced</span> initiation of sexual activity, and typically unreceptive to a partner&rsquo;s attempts to initiate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Absent/reduced</span> sexual <span class=\"nowrap\">excitement/pleasure</span> during sexual activity in almost all or all (approximately 75 to 100 percent) sexual encounters (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Absent/reduced</span> sexual <span class=\"nowrap\">interest/arousal</span> in response to any internal or external <span class=\"nowrap\">sexual/erotic</span> cues (eg, written, verbal, visual).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Absent/reduced</span> genital or nongenital sensations during sexual activity in almost all or all (approximately 75 to 100 percent) sexual encounters (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Female orgasmic disorder</strong> &ndash; Presence of either of the following symptoms and experienced on almost all or all (approximately 75 to 100 percent) occasions of sexual activity (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Marked delay in, marked infrequency of or absence of orgasm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genito-pelvic <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/penetration</span> disorder</strong> (this includes the former categories dyspareunia and vaginismus) &ndash; Persistent or recurrent difficulties with one (or more) of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vaginal penetration during intercourse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in anticipation of, during, or as a result of vaginal penetration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted vaginal penetration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Substance/medication-induced</span> sexual dysfunction</strong> &ndash; A clinically significant disturbance in sexual function is predominant in the clinical picture. There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both of the following: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The involved <span class=\"nowrap\">substance/medication</span> is capable of producing the symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The disturbance is not better explained by a sexual dysfunction that is not <span class=\"nowrap\">substance/medication-induced</span>. Such evidence of an independent sexual dysfunction could include the following: The symptoms precede the onset of the <span class=\"nowrap\">substance/medication</span> use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (eg, about one month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent <span class=\"nowrap\">non-substance/medication-induced</span> sexual dysfunction (eg, a history of recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">non-substance/medication-related</span> episodes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other specified sexual dysfunction</strong> &ndash; This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sexual dysfunction cause clinically significant distress in the individual predominate, but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class. The other specified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific sexual dysfunction. This is done by recording &ldquo;other specified sexual dysfunction&rdquo; followed by the specific reason (eg, &ldquo;sexual aversion&rdquo;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unspecified sexual dysfunction</strong> &ndash; This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sexual dysfunction that cause clinically significant distress in the individual predominate, but do not meet, the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class. The unspecified sexual dysfunction category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses <em>not</em> to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific sexual dysfunction, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis.</p><p/><p>Emerging concepts of normal female sexual function have focused on the differences between female and male sexuality. Specifically, spontaneous desire is unusual in women, except in new relationships, and thus, its absence is not necessarily a disorder. Desire in women typically is responsive, commonly triggered by emotional factors, exposure to erotic images, or physical proximity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. This further highlights the importance of ascertaining before making a diagnosis that not only is a problem present, but also that it is associated with personal distress or interpersonal difficulty.</p><p>In addition, self-reports by women often do not distinguish between desire and arousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. Arousal may relate to either thoughts and feelings or physiological arousal, including genital vasocongestion and lubrication. Most studies identify little correlation between a woman's complaints of limited genital arousal and objective measures of vulvovaginal blood flow and engorgement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete medical and medication history is elicited to identify organic, psychological, medication, and substance-related issues that may affect sexuality (eg, depression, diabetes, use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Suspicion of an undiagnosed medical or mental illness should be followed by evaluation or referral (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above).</p><p>An assessment of sexual problems should be a part of every comprehensive woman's health visit. The importance of this was demonstrated in a questionnaire study of over 1000 women seen for a primary care visit; 98 percent reported one or more sexual concerns, but only 18 percent of clinicians asked about sexual health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. Women who discussed their sexual concerns with their clinician found the discussion helpful. Of approximately 3000 women identified in the PRESIDE study with a distressing sexual problem, only 6 percent of women who sought medical advice scheduled a visit specifically for a sexual problem, and about 80 percent of the time, the woman, rather than the physician, initiated the conversation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p>In women who do not present with sexual complaints, a brief sexual history can be taken while reviewing the gynecologic history (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Sexual history'</a> below).</p><p>A gynecologic history and review of systems should include symptoms and conditions that may affect sexual activity or signal the need for further evaluation, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menopausal status (natural, surgical, or post-chemotherapy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy and childbirth history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of vulvovaginal or pelvic injury, cancer, or surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvovaginal or pelvic pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvovaginal pruritus, dryness, or discharge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal genital tract bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary or fecal incontinence</p><p/><p>The following questions help to assess whether the patient needs assistance to engage in safe sexual practices:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you currently sexually active?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you need contraception or preconceptional counseling?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you practicing safe sex?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Would you like to be screened for sexually transmitted infections?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are you currently experiencing or have you ever experienced sexual abuse?</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-preconception-office-visit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The preconception office visit&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sexually transmitted infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Epidemiology and health consequences&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual history</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Eliciting sexual dysfunction symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to questions regarding basic gynecologic health, contraception and safe sex practices, all women should be asked an open-ended question, such as: Do you have any sexual concerns?</p><p>Menopausal women should be asked specifically about vaginal dryness and dyspareunia.

The approach we use is to inform the patient that sexual problems are important and should be thoroughly evaluated. A follow-up visit is then scheduled to complete the sexual history and address her sexual concerns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">How to take a sexual history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the follow-up visit, a comprehensive sexual history is taken. Questions about sexual activity should be specific, since assumptions should not be made about the gender or number of a patient's sexual partners and about how the patient interprets &quot;sexual activity.&quot;.</p><p>Sexual dysfunction may be a lifelong problem or acquired later in life after a period of normal sexual functioning. In addition, it may be generalized or situational, for example, occurring only in certain settings or with a specific partner.</p><p>Discussion of the sexual complaints should include whether the issues are persistent or recurrent and whether they cause the patient personal distress or interpersonal difficulty.</p><p>As relationship factors are principal determinants of sexual satisfaction for women, women with partners should be asked about the quality of their relationships (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above). A patient should also be asked about whether her partner has sexual issues (eg, lack of desire or erectile dysfunction). Interestingly, in studies of sexual function in older women, a common reason for sexual inactivity was not having a partner or a male partner's sexual problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. As erectile dysfunction in men increases with aging, and women typically live longer than men, the &quot;partner gap&quot; becomes a major cause of sexual dissatisfaction for older women.</p><p>Useful questions are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71711 \">table 1</a>). In addition, there are many questionnaires used to assess sexual dysfunction. For office assessment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder, the Decreased Sexual Desire Screener is useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For diagnosis of sexual dysfunction, a pelvic examination is required only for the sexual pain disorders. However, we suggest performing a pelvic examination in all patients to confirm normal pelvic anatomy, evaluate for genital or pelvic tenderness or lesions, assess for pelvic organ prolapse, or pelvic floor hypertonus, or vulvovaginal atrophy, and follow up concerns raised by the medical history (eg, vaginal discharge or abnormal genital bleeding).

This approach is supported by an Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline, which recommended against making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency because of the lack of both a well-defined clinical syndrome and age-based normative data for serum testosterone and free testosterone concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].
