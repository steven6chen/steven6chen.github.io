A seizure diagnosis has significant quality-of-life implications in older patients, who are already vulnerable to loss of independence, driving restrictions, impaired self-confidence, and risk of falls, which result in physical injury and other sequelae.</p><p>Acute symptomatic seizures are provoked events that are not expected to recur in the absence of a particular trigger (eg, hypoglycemia, alcohol withdrawal). Epilepsy is a condition in which recurrent unprovoked seizures are expected in the absence of treatment.</p><p>This topic will cover aspects of the management of seizures and epilepsy that are specific to older adults. A more general discussion of the treatment of seizures and epilepsy is presented elsewhere. The etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy in older adults is also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults-etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in older adults: Etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, patients with acute symptomatic seizures due to obvious metabolic derangements, medication, or medication withdrawal will not require seizure treatment. Patients with acute seizures caused by an acute intracranial event (stroke, head trauma) are often treated for a limited time (a few weeks to a few months). If seizures do not recur, withdrawal of antiseizure drugs should be considered depending on the patient's other risk factors and comorbidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Poststroke seizures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4116466303\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of recurrence after first seizure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few data regarding the risk of seizure recurrence in older patients with unprovoked seizures, but rates of 80 to 90 percent are often mentioned. In part, this has been inferred from a high rate of recurrence in patients with late-onset seizures following stroke and also from studies in the general adult epilepsy population in which the seizure recurrence rate in the setting of a known underlying cause is as high as 80 percent.</p><p>In a prospective observational study of over 1000 adults presenting with a first-ever unprovoked, 139 of whom were &ge;65 years of age (mean 74 years), the likelihood of a seizure recurrence at one year was similar in older compared with younger adults (53 versus 48 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. By five years, however, the cumulative risk of recurrent seizure was higher in older adults (75 versus 61 percent). Independent predictors of seizure recurrence included remote symptomatic etiology, first seizure arising from sleep, epileptiform abnormality on electroencephalogram (EEG), and focal seizures, but not age.</p><p>These data suggest that the decision about whether or not to start an antiseizure drug in an older patient with a first unprovoked seizure should be based on risk factors for seizure recurrence rather than age, similar to the decision in younger adults. This is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'When to start antiseizure drug therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiseizure drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiseizure drugs are the mainstay of antiseizure treatment. However, their use in older patients is complicated by several factors, including altered pharmacokinetics and increased risk for adverse effects and drug interactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Selection of antiseizure drug</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of a specific antiseizure drug in an older patient should be individualized. Clinicians should consider side-effect profiles of individual antiseizure drugs, choosing those with least potential for harm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59755 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78896 \">table 2</a>). Other considerations include the route of drug metabolism or elimination, comorbid medical conditions, and other prescribed medications.</p><p>For any medication prescribed, chances of success are improved when it is started at a low dose with gradual titration up to a higher dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Monotherapy is greatly preferred over polytherapy. Therapeutic drug monitoring can be helpful in particular situations (eg, documenting adherence or identifying drug interactions) but is of limited routine benefit. Older patients frequently experience efficacy below the standard therapeutic range and often experience symptoms of toxicity at traditionally therapeutic levels. Drug levels are also imprecise, varying by as much as 20 percent in the general population. In an older patient, this may be particularly problematic; one study found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> levels varied as much as threefold in a cohort of nursing home residents who were not taking other medications known to interact with phenytoin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Taken together, results of a limited number of randomized trials in older adults suggest that the newer antiseizure drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, among others) should be considered early in the treatment of epilepsy in older adults due to the lower potential for interactions, linear pharmacokinetics, and lower incidence of side effects compared with older agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>].

Patients randomized to receive lamotrigine had a higher completion rate (71 versus 42 percent), improved seizure-free rate during the last 16 weeks (39 versus 21 percent), and lower rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects (18 versus 42 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> and controlled-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> in 185 patients over 65 years found no differences between groups in study completion, time to drug withdrawal, seizure remission, or treatment-emergent adverse events after 40 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Twelve-month seizure freedom rates were also higher for lamotrigine and levetiracetam (54 and 43 percent) compared with other antiseizure drugs.</p><p/><p>It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from trials with such short follow-up times. Short-term studies emphasizing dropout as an endpoint tend to favor drugs with lower side effects, even if they are less effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The International League Against Epilepsy treatment guidelines conclude that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> have demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in studies of older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Levetiracetam</a> is also an effective agent in older patients and may be better tolerated than carbamazepine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].

In patients with impaired memory, compliance is higher with drugs that can be given once or twice a day. In other patients, however, use of several smaller doses over the day may minimize side effects. Given the observed negative impact of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> therapy in one study of patients with AD, discussed above, it may be reasonable to avoid this drug in this subgroup in favor of other effective medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other factors that play a role in the selection of an antiseizure drug are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Medication expense for those on fixed incomes with limited supplemental coverage is another important consideration. Generic formulations of antiseizure drugs have been considered potentially problematic because of the greater potential variability in the chemical content of generics compared with brand medications. Because older patients are subject to a narrower therapeutic window than younger patients, it is possible that use of generic antiseizure drugs can increase the risk of both side effects and breakthrough seizures. However, this has not been proven, and the benefit of affordability must be balanced with these potential risks. Studies that have examined the issue of generic formulations of antiseizure drugs are discussed in detail separately.

The combined effect of most of these suggests that both a smaller dose and less frequent dosing of antiseizure drugs are required in older patients. These include impaired hepatic metabolism and less enzyme inducibility. Renal elimination decreases by 10 percent per decade over the age of 40 years.</p><p>Decreased concentrations of plasma proteins and albumin with age lower the protein binding of medication, causing the potential for toxic symptoms when drugs appear by total serum levels to be in the therapeutic range. Highly protein-bound drugs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>. Other factors include increased ratio of fat:lean body mass, altering the volume of drug distribution, and decreased gastric motility and increased gastric pH, altering drug absorption.</p><p>Despite these issues, one pharmacokinetic study found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> clearance and half-life were similar in healthy older adults and younger adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], while another found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> clearance was reduced by approximately 20 percent in older compared with younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436296648\"><span class=\"h3\">Polypharmacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another factor complicating antiseizure drug use in older patients is the high prevalence of comorbid medical conditions and polypharmacy. The mean number of medications reported in one prospective randomized study in older adults was 6.7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; one-quarter of patients took &ge;15 medications daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Antiseizure drugs have a high potential for drug interactions; the risk of significant drug interactions increases significantly as the number of medications taken increases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80801%7ENEURO%2F55399%7ENEURO%2F53463\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80801 graphicRef55399 graphicRef53463 \">table 3A-C</a>). Particularly problematic in this regard are the enzyme-inducing antiseizure drugs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>). A combination of drugs that are both highly protein bound may also be more problematic in older rather than younger patients.</p><p>In addition to potential drug interactions, some medications prescribed to older individuals can lower seizure threshold (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54610 \">table 4</a>). In a computerized database of 294 general practices in the United Kingdom, over 10 percent of antiseizure drug prescriptions were coprescribed with at least one proconvulsant drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436296770\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects of antiseizure drugs are a significant problem in older adults because they are frequent and have potential serious sequelae.

Side effects were most common with phenytoin.</p><p>Dose-dependent side effects of antiseizure drugs that are particularly problematic in older patients include confusion, impaired gait, sedation, tremor, dizziness, and visual disturbance. These are potentially problematic with any antiseizure drug. Adverse cognitive side effects of antiseizure drugs are common, especially in patients with underlying brain disease and in the setting of polypharmacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In one study, 26 older patients with epilepsy on antiseizure drug monotherapy had lower cognitive performance on neuropsychologic testing compared with healthy age-, gender-, and education-matched controls. Deficits were comparable to similarly matched patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In one randomized study of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> in 313 patients with mild to moderate AD, a prespecified subset of 89 patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at baseline and 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The aim of the study was to evaluate a putative benefit of valproate in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD. Valproate treatment was associated with a significantly greater decline in hippocampal and total brain volume and Mini-Mental State Examination scores compared with placebo-treated patients. Other cognitive and functional ratings did not differ between the two groups. While this finding is limited to one study, it seems prudent to be cautious in using valproate in patients with seizures and AD if other effective antiseizure drugs that have not been associated with these or other comparable side effects are available as alternatives. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436296937\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteoporosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone loss is of concern in older adults, especially women.

A case-control study comparing 78 individuals on long-term antiseizure drug treatment with age- and sex-matched, drug-naive patients found that antiseizure drugs were an independent risk factor for bone loss (in addition to age, sex, and weight) and that nonenzyme-inducing drugs were equally implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for possible seizures in older adults presenting with intermittent or fluctuating confusional states. The usual clues to the possibility of underlying seizures may be absent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-and-epilepsy-in-older-adults-etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures and epilepsy in older adults: Etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to start an antiseizure drug in an older patient with a first unprovoked seizure should be based on risk factors for seizure recurrence rather than age, similar to the decision in younger adults. Major risk factors for recurrent seizure include remote symptomatic etiology, first seizure arising from sleep, epileptiform abnormality on electroencephalogram (EEG), and focal seizures. (See <a href=\"#H4116466303\" class=\"local\">'Risk of recurrence after first seizure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiseizure drug therapy is complicated by potential drug interactions and high rates of side effects. Success may be optimized by starting at low doses and titrating slowly up to higher doses. Target therapeutic doses and drug levels should be lower in older adults compared with younger populations. Antiseizure drug polypharmacy should be avoided whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Antiseizure drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Selection of an antiseizure drug in older adults should be individualized according to seizure or epilepsy type, comorbidities, adverse effect profile, and drug-drug interactions. Drugs without strong hepatic enzyme-inducing properties, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, have lower potential for interactions and improved pharmacokinetics compared with enzyme-inducing drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Selection of antiseizure drug'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest calcium and vitamin D supplementation for older patients receiving antiseizure drugs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Bone mineral density testing is also suggested in patients taking antiseizure drugs on a chronic basis, especially enzyme-inducing drugs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>.
