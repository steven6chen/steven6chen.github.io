The incidence of stroke-related pneumonia appears to be higher in patients with acute ischemic stroke admitted to a neurologic intensive care unit and in those who require nasogastric tube feeding (21 and 44 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Patients with stroke-related pneumonia have a higher mortality and a poorer long-term outcome when compared with patients without pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Pneumonia is the most common cause of fever within the first 48 hours of acute stroke, and it is the most common medical complication two to four weeks after a supratentorial ischemic infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. In addition, retrospective data suggest that pneumonia and respiratory illness are the most frequent diagnoses leading to hospital readmission in stroke survivors in the first five years after ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In a prospective study of 412 patients with acute stroke, independent risk factors for in-hospital pneumonia were age &gt;65 years, dysarthria or no speech due to aphasia, severe poststroke disability, cognitive impairment, and an abnormal water swallow test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In an earlier prospective study of 124 patients with acute stroke treated in the intensive care unit, risk factors were mechanical ventilation, abnormal chest radiograph on admission, and dysphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In patients requiring nasogastric feeding, independent risk factors for pneumonia were facial palsy and deceased level of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Several studies have noted an increased incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia with gastric acid suppression using histamine-2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'Role of gastric pH'</a>). In a report of 1676 hospitalized patients admitted with acute stroke, acid-suppressive medications were ordered in 80 percent and hospital-acquired pneumonia developed in 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Compared with the unexposed group, the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia was significantly higher in the group exposed to acid-suppressive medications (21 versus 4 percent, adjusted odds ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.6).</p><p>Aspiration is the cause of about 60 percent of post-stroke pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Aspiration pneumonia refers to the pulmonary consequences resulting from the abnormal entry of fluid, particulate exogenous substances, or endogenous secretions into the lower airways. Most pneumonia arises following the &quot;aspiration&quot; of microorganisms from the oral cavity or nasopharynx. Aspiration pneumonia following stroke is usually due to stroke-related dysphagia (ie, impairment of motor and sensory mechanisms involved in deglutition) or to a decreased level of consciousness that results in compromise of the cough reflex and glottic closure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-complications-of-stroke#H51492085\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical complications of stroke&quot;, section on 'Dysphagia and aspiration'</a>.)</p><p>The dependent pulmonary segments are usually affected in aspiration pneumonia. The most common sites of involvement are the posterior segments of the upper lobes or apical segments of the lower lobes if aspiration occurs while recumbent, and the lower lobes if the patient aspirates while upright or semi-upright. Causative organisms and treatment of aspiration pneumonia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measures to prevent aspiration pneumonia in patients with dysphagia include initial nil per os (NPO; nothing by mouth) status and subsequent dietary modifications for those who have persistent dysphagia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, screening on admission for swallowing difficulty is probably the most important measure to prevent pneumonia in patients with acute stroke. Use of a formal screening protocol for dysphagia for all patients admitted with stroke has been associated with a significantly decreased risk of aspiration pneumonia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-complications-of-stroke#H51492085\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical complications of stroke&quot;, section on 'Dysphagia and aspiration'</a>.)</p><p>Given the apparent increased risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia associated with the use of histamine-2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors, it is reasonable to avoid agents that suppress gastric acid in patients who are not at high risk of developing a stress ulcer or stress gastritis. Prophylactic antibiotics for patients with acute stroke do not reduce the incidence of poststroke pneumonia or improve functional outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. A number of other interventions (eg, positioning, drugs, oral hygiene, tube feeding, influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination) have been proposed to prevent aspiration in hospitalized and nonhospitalized older adult patients. However, no clinical trials have evaluated the utility of these measures specifically in patients with stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal vaccination in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-vaccination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza vaccination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent the breakdown of substance P, an important mediator of the cough reflex, but there is conflicting evidence regarding the utility of ACE inhibitors for preventing pneumonia in patients with stroke. Data from several observational studies suggest that ACE inhibitors significantly lower the risk of aspiration pneumonia in older adult Japanese patients with stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. However, post-hoc analysis of a multinational randomized controlled trial found that ACE inhibitor use was associated with a statistically nonsignificant reduced risk of pneumonia in patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA); a subgroup analysis found significant benefit for patients of Asian ethnicity only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, a case-control trial from the Netherlands reported that ACE inhibitor use was not associated with a decreased incidence of pneumonia in a general (mostly white) population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANICAL VENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intubation and mechanical ventilation of patients with ischemic stroke is usually performed secondary to pulmonary edema or for inability to protect the airway because of a decreased level of consciousness from effects of the stroke or seizure. Additional indications include partial airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and aspiration pneumonia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Central nervous system'</a>.)</p><p>In a single-center retrospective series of 24 patients with hemispheric ischemic stroke, mechanical ventilation was initiated for bilateral pulmonary edema from heart failure (n = 10), progression to stupor from brain swelling (n = 8), and generalized seizures or status epilepticus (n = 6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The morbidity and mortality in patients intubated after acute stroke is very high. In the study just cited, death occurred in 17 of the 24 patients (71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another retrospective study found that among a group of 74 patients with ischemic stroke receiving mechanical ventilation, 56 (76 percent) were either dead or had severe disability requiring nursing home placement at discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Intubation is infrequently required in ischemic stroke, but the rate may be more frequent in intracerebral hemorrhage. As an example, intubation rates in one retrospective study for ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage were 6 and 30 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Complications related to endotracheal intubation include laryngeal injury (eg, laryngeal edema, vocal cord dysfunction), swallowing impairment, tracheal stenosis, tracheoesophageal fistula, cuff leaks, sinusitis, and biofilm formation. The most common complications of prolonged mechanical ventilation are related to infections or tracheostomy. These are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Even patients with stroke deemed safe to eat have a greater likelihood of desaturation after completion of a meal than do older adult controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with a history of cardiac and pulmonary diseases are also at higher risk for desaturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In these studies, most patients were asymptomatic during periods of desaturation, suggesting that silent desaturation may be more common than previously recognized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROGENIC PULMONARY EDEMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurogenic-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurogenic pulmonary edema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>NPE is an increase in interstitial and alveolar fluid that occurs in the setting of an acute central nervous system injury, particularly head trauma, seizures, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57483\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57483 \">table 1</a>). The alveoli are flooded with proteinaceous, hemorrhagic fluid. Radiographically, it is indistinguishable from hydrostatic pulmonary edema. NPE occurs in only a minority of patients with acute stroke, usually following subarachnoid hemorrhage or uncontrolled seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology is not clear, but hemodynamic and permeability factors are cited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurogenic-pulmonary-edema#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurogenic pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurogenic-pulmonary-edema#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurogenic pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of edema formation'</a>.)</p><p>NPE most often develops abruptly and progresses quickly after the onset of the neurologic insult. In contrast, aspiration pneumonia usually takes longer to become manifest. However, NPE with delayed onset (hours to days) has been described. Resolution usually occurs within several days. The typical patient with NPE is dyspneic, tachycardic, and hypertensive, with bilateral rales. The chest radiograph reveals bilateral infiltrates that tend to be more interstitial than alveolar, and the cardiac silhouette may appear normal or enlarged. At the time of diagnosis, the cardiac filling pressures are usually normal. In some patients, florid pulmonary edema does not occur, but transient respiratory difficulty and hypoxemia with a normal chest radiograph are evident soon after a stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurogenic-pulmonary-edema#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurogenic pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>NPE is a clinical diagnosis based upon the occurrence of pulmonary edema in the appropriate setting and in the absence of a more likely alternative cause. Central to the diagnosis is a strong index of suspicion when pulmonary congestion develops in patients with head trauma (especially with elevated intracranial pressure), seizures, status epilepticus, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurogenic-pulmonary-edema#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurogenic pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Most cases of NPE resolve spontaneously and are well tolerated, but the condition can be fatal in severe cases. The management of NPE is largely supportive and directed mainly towards treatment of the underlying neurologic condition. Most patients with NPE are hypoxemic and require supplemental oxygen. Some patients may require mechanical ventilation, which differs from that for other causes of respiratory failure in two ways: permissive hypercapnia and high levels of positive end expiratory pressure should be avoided. A variety of medications have been used to treat patients with NPE, but their efficacy in this setting has not been established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurogenic-pulmonary-edema#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurogenic pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ABNORMAL RESPIRATORY PATTERNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal respiratory patterns are a common consequence of stroke. Abnormal breathing patterns are recognized in approximately 60 percent of patients with acute neurologic disorders, including acute stroke. In a subset of these patients, underlying cardiac and respiratory abnormalities account for the abnormal breathing pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Among the recognized abnormal respiratory patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74371\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74371 \">figure 1</a>) are Cheyne-Stokes breathing, periodic breathing, apneustic breathing, central sleep apnea, ataxic breathing, and failure of automatic breathing (Ondine's curse) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Abnormal breathing patterns are more common among patients with impaired consciousness, with severe deficits, during sleep, and in patients with medullary infarcts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. Most respiratory patterns do not have prognostic significance or imply involvement of specific areas of the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Only sustained tachypnea with low PaCO<sub>2</sub> is associated with poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

It is the most commonly recognized abnormal respiratory pattern after stroke, but in approximately 90 percent of patients it reflects underlying cardiopulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-disordered-breathing-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Initially believed to be due to bilateral forebrain disease or diffuse bihemispheric disease, Cheyne-Stokes respiration is now known to occur with unilateral hemispheric and brainstem infarcts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. Cheyne-Stokes respiration has little prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. However, hypocapnia is almost always present and may require treatment to prevent cerebral vasoconstriction and exacerbation of the underlying neurologic condition. Hypoxemia is frequently present due to concomitant heart and lung disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Periodic breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic breathing, a variant of Cheyne-Stokes respiration, is characterized by regular, recurrent cycles of changing tidal volumes in which the lowest tidal volume is less than half the maximal tidal volume in that cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It is the most frequent abnormal respiratory pattern directly related to stroke rather than underlying systemic disease, occurring in approximately 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>].

It is the only respiratory pattern with true localizing value and is indicative of a medullary lesion. It may occur in patients with neurodegenerative disorders (such as multiple system atrophy) but when developing acutely should always raise suspicion for a medullary stroke.</p><p>Ataxic breathing is caused by dysfunction of the dorsal respiratory neurons in the medulla that control the rhythmicity of breathing. In one case series of 227 patients, ataxic breathing was found in all 12 patients with medullary strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The prognosis for recovery is generally poor.</p><p>Complete apnea during sleep with normal ventilation during wakefulness has been termed Ondine's curse. It occurs due to an interruption of the brainstem respiratory generators or their spinal projections but with preserved integrity of corticospinal pathways which control the more voluntary aspects of respiratory control. Ondine's curse is generally treated with mechanical ventilation during sleep.

Stroke-related pneumonia is associated with a higher mortality and a poorer long-term outcome. Risk factors for in-hospital pneumonia include older age, dysarthria, aphasia, stroke severity, cognitive impairment, use of gastric acid suppressive medications, and an abnormal water swallow test. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intubation and mechanical ventilation of patients with ischemic stroke is usually performed to treat pulmonary edema or for inability to protect the airway. The morbidity and mortality in patients intubated after acute stroke is high. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical ventilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) is an increase in interstitial and alveolar fluid that occurs in the setting of head trauma, seizures, or stroke, particularly subarachnoid hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57483\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57483 \">table 1</a>). NPE most often develops abruptly and progresses quickly after the onset of the neurologic insult. The typical patient with NPE is dyspneic, tachycardic, and hypertensive, with bilateral rales. Most cases of NPE resolve spontaneously and are well tolerated, but the condition can be fatal in severe cases. Treatment of NPE is largely supportive and directed mainly towards treatment of the underlying neurologic condition. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Neurogenic pulmonary edema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal breathing patterns are a common consequence of stroke. Among the recognized abnormal respiratory patterns are Cheyne-Stokes breathing, periodic breathing, apneustic breathing, central sleep apnea, ataxic breathing, and failure of automatic breathing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74371\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74371 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Abnormal respiratory patterns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationship of sleep disordered breathing (including both obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea syndrome) as a possible risk factor for stroke and as a possible complication of stroke is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related breathing disorders and stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374673894\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate, Inc. would like to acknowledge Dr. Teresa Jacobs, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Johnston KC, Li JY, Lyden PD, et al.
