Both RR and V<sub>T</sub> in turn are determined by central and peripheral factors. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The central respiratory center in the medulla comprises respiratory pacer cells, and receives stimulatory signals from central and peripheral chemoreceptors (respond to changes in hydrogen ion concentration, PaCO<sub>2 </sub>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52101\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52101 \">figure 1</a>), and partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>]<sub> </sub>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79832 \">figure 2</a>)), as well as mechanoreceptors and thermal receptors in the upper airway and lung (respond to mechanical stimuli such as stretch, or changes in temperature related to flow). Respiratory drive is also uniquely responsive to behavioral and cognitive inputs from the cortex (eg, anxiety and pain). These signals are integrated centrally into a combined output to the muscles of respiration to ultimately affect V<sub>E</sub>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The peripheral muscles of respiration (eg, diaphragm, intercostal muscles, sternocleidomastoids, scalenes, trapezii) can affect V<sub>E</sub> by altering RR as well as depth and duration of inspiration (affects V<sub>T</sub>). In the presence of muscular weakness, patients typically adopt a rapid shallow breathing pattern. This leads to increased <span class=\"nowrap\">VD/VT</span> and, while total ventilation may be the same or even increased compared to normal, alveolar ventilation is reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minute ventilation is also influenced by thoracic cage compliance such that despite adequate central respiratory drive and peripheral muscle function, limitations in lung expansion (which reduce V<sub>T</sub>) can occur in patients with thoracic cage dysfunction (eg, thoracoplasty). While initially RR will increase to compensate for a reduction in V<sub>T</sub> (to maintain resting alveolar ventilation), eventually RR will fall as fatigue ensues (eg, during times of stress or exercise) or as disease progresses. As with neuromuscular disease, a rapid-shallow breathing pattern increases V<sub>D</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/V<sub>T</sub></span> and reduces alveolar ventilation for any given total ventilation. If the patient is not able to increase total ventilation sufficiently to compensate for the increased V<sub>D</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/V<sub>T</sub></span> ratio, hypercapnia will ensue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, reduction in either central respiratory drive (won't breathe) or peripheral muscle, nerve, and thoracic cage function (can't breathe) will affect V<sub>E</sub> and result in global hypoventilation or normal total ventilation with increased V<sub>D</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/V<sub>T</sub></span> leading to a reduced alveolar ventilation and hypercapnia. In patients with underlying problems with the ventilatory pump, a superimposed gas exchange problem or increased CO<sub>2</sub> production may lead to hypercapnia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Inadequate ventilation'</a> and <a href=\"#H1018433444\" class=\"local\">'Etiologies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In contrast to respiratory rate, tidal volume and total ventilation cannot be readily estimated at the bedside. When a patient hypoventilates, PaO<sub>2</sub> drops roughly in proportion to the rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub> as dictated by the alveolar gas equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>PaO<sub>2</sub> = FiO<sub>2</sub> (Patm-Pwater vapor) &ndash; PaCO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/R</span></p></div></div><p>PaO<sub>2</sub> is alveolar partial pressure of oxygen, FiO<sub>2</sub> is the fraction of oxygen in the inspired gas, Patm is barometric pressure, Pwater vapor reflects the fact that the gas that reaches the alveolus is fully humidified by the airways, and R is the respiratory quotient (ie, the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> produced for each molecule of oxygen consumed by metabolism). The first part of the equation reflects the partial pressure of oxygen in inspired gas. As an example, at altitude the barometric pressure is reduced and PaO<sub>2</sub> is reduced, which will lead to hypoxemia. The second part of the equation represents alveolar ventilation, given the relationship between PaCO<sub>2</sub> and alveolar ventilation noted above. If alveolar ventilation is reduced, the oxygen diffusing into the blood from the alveolus is not rapidly replenished (nor is the CO<sub>2</sub> diffusing into the alveolus from the blood being removed normally); consequently, there is less oxygen in the alveolus (and more CO<sub>2</sub>), and less oxygen in the blood.</p><p>Thus, when a patient presents with hypoxemia, it is important for the clinician to consider the possibility of hypoventilation as a cause of hypoxemia before starting supplemental oxygen. Consequently, high level of clinical suspicion for global hypoventilation is necessary to prompt an arterial blood gas for the early detection, prevention, and treatment of hypercapnia. The clinical evaluation and treatment of hypercapnia is discussed in detail separately.

The cause of global hypoventilation can arise anywhere along the axis from the respiratory control center in the medulla, the upper motor neurons, the spinal cord (anterior horn cells), the lower motor neurons (ie, phrenic nerve), neuromuscular junction, or the respiratory muscle (diaphragm, intercostal muscles, scalenes, sternocleidomastoids, trapezii) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F103091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103091 \">table 1</a>).

In general, the anatomical dead space (in milliliters) is approximately equal to the patient's body weight in pounds. An individual's pattern of breathing, primarily the size of the inspiration, determines the proportion of the breath that is allocated to the anatomic dead space, ie, it changes the V<sub>D</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/V<sub>T</sub></span>. If the anatomic dead space is 150 mL and one takes a 450 mL breath, the V<sub>D</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/V<sub>T</sub></span> is 0.33 (assuming minimal alveolar dead space); if one then changes the breathing pattern so that the tidal volume is 300 mL, the <span class=\"nowrap\">VD/VT</span> is now 0.5. If total ventilation is unchanged, hypercapnia will result.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alveolar dead space</strong> &ndash; The alveolar dead space reflects reduced perfusion to alveoli that are ventilated. Thus, dead space (positive ventilation but no perfusion) is on the opposite spectrum of <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatch from shunt (no ventilation but positive perfusion). An increase in alveolar dead space is the main mechanism that underlies hypercapnia in patients with parenchymal lung disease (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], pneumonia, interstitial fibrosis) and pulmonary vascular disease. Conditions that increase dead space to result in hypercapnia are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1018432932\" class=\"local\">'Etiologies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H454077410\" class=\"local\">'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physiological dead space</strong> &ndash; The combination of anatomic and alveolar dead space is called physiological dead space.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1018432932\"><span class=\"h3\">Etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid shallow breathing can contribute to hypercapnia by increasing the dead space to tidal volume ratio, because the anatomic dead space in the central airways comprises a larger proportion of the smaller tidal breath. Increased alveolar dead space is mostly seen in patients with intrinsic lung disease that affects the gas-exchanging component of the lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F103091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103091 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Increases in alveolar dead space can be due to pulmonary capillary compression (extrinsic obstruction) from overinflated lung (eg, too much positive pressure on mechanical ventilation) or destruction of pulmonary capillaries (emphysema, interstitial fibrosis, pulmonary vasculitis). In most cases, the initial increase in dead space stimulates minute ventilation in an attempt to normalize PaCO<sub>2</sub>, so that many patients with these disorders are initially normocapnic. It is only when this compensatory mechanism is impaired (usually because of problems with the ventilatory pump, such as muscle weakness or increased airway resistance) that increased dead space will result in clinically relevant hypercapnia (eg, patients with severe or endstage lung disease). (See <a href=\"#H447566408\" class=\"local\">'Increased dead space'</a> above.) </p><p>Increased V<sub>D</sub> (ie, areas of high <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q)</span> is thought to be the main mechanism that contributes to the development of hypercapnia in patients with COPD, the details of which are discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It should be noted that the relatively linear relationship between PaCO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> content of the blood often allows hyperventilation of the normal lung units to compensate for diseased units with high <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q;</span> thus, patients with mild to moderate <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> abnormalities may be hypoxemic but not hypercapnic. (See <a href=\"#H454077410\" class=\"local\">'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447566414\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased production of carbon dioxide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CO<sub>2</sub> production is a product of oxidative metabolism. Increased CO<sub>2</sub> production is rarely the <strong>primary</strong> cause of hypercapnia because the usual response to increased CO<sub>2</sub> production is an increased V<sub>E</sub>, which eliminates excess CO<sub>2</sub> to maintain a normal PaCO<sub>2</sub>. However, an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> production can <strong>partially</strong> contribute to an elevated PaCO<sub>2</sub>, when the ability to increase alveolar ventilation (V<sub>A</sub>) is limited (eg, severe COPD exacerbation, respiratory muscle weakness; ie, conditions that increase dead space or prevent the normal compensatory increase in global ventilation). </p><p>CO<sub>2</sub> production rises with fever, thyrotoxicosis, increased catabolism (sepsis, steroids), overfeeding, exercise and metabolic acidosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F103091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103091 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454077410\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased V<sub>D</sub> (ie, areas of high <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q)</span> is thought to be the main mechanism that contributes to the development of hypercapnia in patients with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. While some patients can compensate by increasing their V<sub>E</sub> and redistributing perfusion to improve <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> matching, (eg, the classic normocapnic &quot;pink puffer&quot;), some patients cannot compensate and develop chronic hypercapnia (eg, the classic &quot;blue bloater&quot;). Other patients with COPD will develop hypercapnia with an exacerbation or in response to supplemental oxygen, which reverts to normal once the exacerbation resolves (reversible hypercapnia) or oxygen is weaned, respectively. The mechanisms that explain hypercapnia in COPD are as follows:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13453387\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypercapnia at baseline/during exacerbations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors contributing to the increased dead space (increased ventilation relative to perfusion) and the consequent development of hypercapnia in COPD at baseline or during exacerbations (in the absence of oxygen) include destruction of capillaries by emphysema, airflow obstruction leading to hyperinflation, and reduced lung compliance at high lung volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, the breathing pattern in patients with COPD and hypercapnia is different from that found in their normocapnic counterparts; hypercapnic patients tend to have lower tidal volumes and an increased respiratory rate, which increases V<sub>D</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/V<sub>T</sub></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

However, during an exacerbation, patients with COPD exhibited an increased respiratory rate, lower tidal volume, and increased respiratory drive (as measured by mouth occlusion pressure) when compared to normal controls. </p><p>The lower tidal volumes in patients with COPD are the consequence of several factors. Respiratory drive, as measured by mouth occlusion pressure or inspiratory flow rate appears to be high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]; this may result in a shortened inspiratory time. Because of increased expiratory resistance, expiratory time must be prolonged to allow the individual to return to functional residual capacity (ie, relaxation volume, when the outward recoil of the chest wall is equal and opposite to the inward recoil of the lung) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78052\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78052 \">figure 4</a>). The mechanisms of this abnormal breathing pattern remain unclear but likely include hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], stimulation of pulmonary irritant and J receptors by coexisting chronic bronchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], and cognitive factors relating to respiratory discomfort. In addition, inspiratory capacity is reduced when respiratory rate increases due to dynamic hyperinflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Importantly, the potential development of hypercapnia should not preclude the administration of oxygen to patients with COPD who are hypoxemic, since withholding it can be potentially harmful (the combination of an acute respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia may lead to cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial dysfunction). The mechanism of oxygen-induced hypercapnia in COPD is discussed in this section. The safe administration of oxygen to this population is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-evaluation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-the-adult-patient-with-acute-hypercapnic-respiratory-failure#H933406661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the adult patient with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure&quot;, section on 'Titration of oxygen'</a>.) </p><p>It was originally thought that patients with COPD rely on their hypoxemic ventilatory drive due to a blunted sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> (ie, pH), and that hypercapnia in this setting resulted from &quot;removal&quot; of hypoxemic drive with a consequent reduction in alveolar ventilation. In general, the control of breathing is dependent upon central drive (inspiratory neurons in the medulla) when asleep, and the reticular activating system when awake (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;</a>). It is now thought that the major reason for oxygen-induced hypercapnia in patients with COPD is worsening of <span class=\"nowrap\">ventilation/perfusion</span> mismatch leading to increased dead space; while the administration of oxygen does <strong>diminish</strong> hypoxic ventilatory drive, its contribution to the acute rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub> when supplemental oxygen is administered is relatively minor. Decreased binding affinity of hemoglobin for carbon dioxide (the Haldane effect) in the presence of oxygen also contributes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].

When patients were given supplemental oxygen at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> during an exacerbation, minute ventilation dropped by only 14 percent due to a small decrease in respiratory rate without a change in tidal volume. However, this reduction in minute ventilation could not account for the entire increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub>; further analysis led to the conclusion that hypercapnia was primarily due to an increase in the dead space to tidal volume ratio. Although ventilatory drive decreased in response to supplemental oxygen, it remained three times greater than in normal controls, suggesting that respiratory drive is not eliminated by the administration of supplemental oxygen in this population. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another prospective study examined the effects of administration of a FiO<sub>2</sub> of 1 on patients with chronically stable COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. All patients had an initial decrease in minute ventilation of approximately 18 percent, which then returned to approximately 93 percent of baseline after 12 minutes, despite continued oxygen administration. The initial decrease in minute ventilation was due to reductions in both tidal volume and respiratory rate. After 15 minutes of oxygen administration, the PaCO<sub>2</sub> increased by an average of 23 mmHg, which was due to three components:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Increased dead space </strong>&ndash; The largest component of acute hypercapnia (11 mmHg, 48 percent) was due to an increase in dead space ventilation (ie, areas of high <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q)</span>. This probably reflects worsening of <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> matching due to a loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) (ie, redirection of blood flow from relatively well ventilated units to poorly ventilated units). HPV normally serves to improve the matching between blood flow and ventilation. This compensatory response improves <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> matching and decreases physiologic dead space. The effect of loss of HPV is most pronounced in patients with a low initial PaO<sub>2</sub>. The importance of <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatching has been confirmed in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Haldane effect</strong> &ndash; An additional 7 mmHg (30 percent) rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub> was attributed to decreased hemoglobin affinity for CO<sub>2</sub> (the Haldane effect) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The Haldane effect refers to the rightward displacement of the CO<sub>2</sub>-hemoglobin dissociation curve in the presence of increased oxygen saturation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63166\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63166 \">figure 5</a>). This occurs because oxyhemoglobin binds CO<sub>2</sub> less avidly than deoxyhemoglobin; thus, addition of oxygen to the blood displaces CO<sub>2</sub> from hemoglobin thereby increasing the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in blood, which in turn determines PaCO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The Haldane effect is most pronounced when the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) changes most per mmHg of PaO<sub>2</sub> (ie, on the steep part of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve), which is between a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 20 and 60 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Decreased minute ventilation</strong> &ndash; Only about 5 mmHg (22 percent) could be directly attributed to the small (7 percent) decrease in minute ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The relative contributions of a reduction in minute ventilation, the Haldane effect, and changes in <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> matching have been confirmed by computer models of gas exchange and pulmonary hemodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study of 22 patients with exacerbations of COPD reported a reduction in minute ventilation in response to 100 percent oxygen in those who developed hypercapnia (CO<sub>2</sub> retainers), when compared with those who remained normocapnic (non-retainers) (1.8 versus 0 L) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, a limitation of this study is the definition of CO<sub>2</sub> retention as an increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 3 mmHg, which is likely clinically insignificant. Additionally, both CO<sub>2</sub> retainers and non-retainers had mean PaO<sub>2</sub> levels &gt;54 mmHg. This would minimize the role of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and the Haldane effect, both of which are more prominent at lower partial pressures of oxygen.</p><p/><p>The FiO<sub>2</sub> associated with different flow rates with nasal cannula depends upon the patient's total minute ventilation (the greater the ventilation, the lower the FiO<sub>2</sub> for any given flow rate because the individual is entraining larger volumes of &quot;room air&quot; thereby diluting the supplemental oxygen; alternatively, with lower minute ventilation, the supplemental oxygen comprises a greater portion of the inspired gas). In addition, the stimulation of flow receptors by inspiratory gas in the nasopharynx reduces respiratory drive independently of changes in PaO<sub>2</sub>. Consequently, the FiO<sub>2</sub> may rise as ventilation falls, which could lead to a cycle that results in progressive hypercapnia. </p><p>Importantly, abrupt removal of supplemental oxygen may cause the PaO<sub>2</sub> to fall to a level lower than when oxygen therapy was begun. The development of hypoxemia in this setting is more rapid than the resolution of hypercapnia (CO<sub>2</sub> stores in the body are large due to the ability of CO<sub>2</sub> to diffuse into a range of tissues), and subsequent tissue hypoxia can potentially cause or worsen metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, the acute withdrawal of oxygen is not recommended. The titration of oxygen in hypercapnic patients is discussed separately.

Eucapnic individuals do not exhibit a depressed level of consciousness until the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) is greater than 75 to 80 mmHg (10 to 10.6 kPa), while patients with chronic hypercapnia may not develop symptoms until the PaCO<sub>2</sub> rises acutely to greater than 90 to 100 mmHg. In addition, patients with chronic hypercapnia have a compensatory loss of hydrogen ions from the kidney, associated with a rise in the plasma bicarbonate concentration. As a result, a larger elevation in PaCO<sub>2</sub> is required to produce the same reduction in pH. This feature can be used during arterial blood gas analysis to distinguish acute from acute-on-chronic and chronic hypercapnia, the details of which are discussed separately.

Importantly, serum bicarbonate levels rise slightly with an acute respiratory acidosis because of the carbonic acid reaction. Bicarbonate is not an effective buffer for a respiratory acidosis (the body&rsquo;s main buffer for respiratory acidosis is protein, primarily hemoglobin in red blood cells).
