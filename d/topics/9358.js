Intrauterine device (IUD) insertion and removal are usually relatively simple procedures that can be performed in the office setting by trained providers. The technical skills required for device insertion and removal can be obtained through proctored hands-on training in the clinical setting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may be provided by the manufacturers of these devices. This review is not intended as a substitute for hands-on clinical training.</p><p>This topic will address technical issues regarding the insertion and removal procedures for the copper-releasing and progestin-containing IUDs.

Most women, including nulliparous women, adolescents, women who are immediately postpartum or postabortion, women with almost all acute or chronic medical conditions, and women desiring emergency contraception are candidates for intrauterine contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides comprehensive evidence-based guidelines regarding safety of various contraceptive methods in women with specific characteristics or medical conditions (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/pdf/summary-chart-us-medical-eligibility-criteria_508tagged.pdf&amp;token=p7A56cdQa48oh8HfN4dMPEKlrim7QFIQY/uVV/JckGU937u1ckJkmkgaK8H2PBoY/J5BEapx7DHdp5gqM+K1cZFvupA973jfwqlDuJ3YBVeBCZhIb4QeOsKswDD+1dvSISE9r+Ivb9WDleMu0Qs/MQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3267\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States&nbsp;Medical Eligibility Criteria&nbsp;(USMEC) for Contraceptive Use</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Further information about IUD candidacy and contraindications as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the various types of devices are discussed in detail separately.

High-quality interpersonal communication is associated with improved uptake, satisfaction, and continuation of IUDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We find the website <a href=\"http://www.bedsider.org/&amp;token=4qpXt3YQayW2yNFel0nvTLDtm97QKzeSb3E6A8FCrrmvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=3267\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">bedsider.org</a> to be a noncommercial, patient-friendly, and accurate source of information for patients that reviews the benefits and risks of all contraceptive methods and compares IUDs with all other birth control options. Further information about contraceptive counseling and specific IUD devices are discussed separately.

Timing IUD insertion with menses ensures that the patient is not pregnant, but does not reduce pain or improve patient outcomes. A 2013 systematic review concluded that the timing of copper IUD insertion with regard to menses has little effect on insertional pain or short or long term expulsion rates (one study reported reduced pain with menstrual insertion, one reported increased pain, and two reported no difference) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Moreover, delays in scheduling IUD insertion to coincide with menses may increase patient risk of unplanned pregnancy. Thus, we do not recommend routinely waiting to schedule IUD insertion to coincide with menses.</p><p>Given the risks associated with IUD insertion in a setting of concomitant intrauterine pregnancy, documentation of a negative pregnancy test prior to IUD insertion is advised for most women, but particularly for those with lactational amenorrhea or other conditions that lead to irregular intervals between menses (unclear timing of ovulation) or questionable compliance with contraception. To increase reliability, the pregnancy test should be obtained two or more weeks after her last episode of unprotected intercourse. Clinics that offer IUD insertions should have a protocol that includes counseling, screening (including exclusion of pregnancy), and insertion of the IUD in one visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Single-visit insertion results in more IUD placements than when two visits are required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18272372\"><span class=\"h2\">Women who are switching from another method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who are using a different contraceptive method and wish to initiate an IUD, the copper IUD is effective immediately upon insertion. Thus, women who choose this method do not require any back-up contraception regardless of prior method of contraception. </p><p>In contrast, it is thought that women who select a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD may be at risk for unplanned pregnancy in the first week after IUD insertion because hormonal IUDs are potentially not immediately effective. Women who are using other methods of contraception (ie, pill, patch, ring, contraceptive implant, barrier methods, or copper IUD) and have a hormonal IUD placed should be advised about the need for back-up contraception or abstinence for seven days after IUD insertion unless the woman:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a sure and reliable last menstrual period less than five days ago </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Received injectable contraception less than 14 weeks ago</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is exchanging a hormonal IUD and has a therapeutically active <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> IUD removed at the time of new hormonal IUD insertion </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexually transmitted infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be asymptomatic, we counsel all women about STI risk and offer voluntary screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia to all women presenting for IUD insertion regardless of risk factors. Additionally, we routinely recommend screening women based on the CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/screeningreccs.htm&amp;token=7/sDq8EttCAPckeysg/UmYytOIJ27df7gTnINoq8sXpK3WDsgwkBRTu13cnkfvqIjS6RE45y+rF3xEXtxDdZFQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3267\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">STD &amp; HIV Screening Recommendations</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Since age is the strongest risk factor for STI incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], we encourage gonorrhea and chlamydia screening at the time of IUD placement for all women age 25 and younger. It is important to emphasize that for all women without symptoms, screening can be performed at the time of IUD insertion, and insertion should not be delayed for test results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>].</p><p>If gonorrheal or chlamydia testing obtained at time of IUD placement subsequently returns positive, the infection should be treated per the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/tg-2015-print.pdf&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLKy1Ja7NNbTQNlMM7q+2yK4OkwmJc+s7K0PH4P9UDl3HZ+Qu/jb/hF0pSViGf8s78A==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3267\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">CDC Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines</a>, and the IUD can be left in situ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

For these women, IUD insertion should be delayed until the woman has (1) completed diagnostic work-up and her full treatment course, (2) her symptoms have resolved completely, and (3) her cervical and pelvic physical examinations are normal. Optimal timing for IUD insertion after completion of treatment for cervicitis or an upper genital tract infection is unknown. Sexual partners should also complete treatment according to standard guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If the patient remains at risk of reinfection, a reassessment of IUD eligibility and a negative test for gonorrhea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chlamydia, usually done three to four weeks after treatment, should be confirmed prior to placing an IUD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Management of side effects and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to gonorrhea and chlamydia, no large studies have evaluated the outcome of IUD insertion in the presence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) or trichomoniasis. In one small prospective study, five women with documented BV had an IUD inserted without complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A larger prospective study found that women with BV at the time of IUD insertion were more likely to have dysmenorrhea, but not other complications, at their six-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. If a suspicious vaginal discharge is identified, the device manufacturers recommend diagnostic testing and treatment of infection, but there is no evidence to support routine screening for BV in asymptomatic patients or to delay IUD insertion during diagnostic work-up for BV. The CDC specifically states that for women with vaginitis, including BV and trichomoniasis, the advantages of IUD insertion typically outweigh theoretical or proven risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis for the placement of an IUD is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/2,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13-17</a>], even for women with valvular heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. The use of routine prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of IUD complications has been investigated in four large randomized trials. A meta-analysis of these trials found that prophylactic antibiotics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>) decreased the frequency of unscheduled visits post-IUD insertion (odds ratio [OR] 0.82, 95% CI 0.70-0.98), but there was no significant decrease in occurrence of pelvic inflammatory disease (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53-1.51) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>There is also no evidence to support antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent endocarditis. In one study, there was a 0 percent incidence of bacteremia following IUD insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The American Heart Association does not recommend endocarditis prophylaxis for IUD insertion in the absence of a pelvic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1890302906\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesia</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2676599928\"><span class=\"h3\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preprocedural planning should take into account a patient's general tolerance for office procedures. A woman's perception of pain is influenced by her anxiety, anticipated level of pain, and relationship with the clinician. Risk factors for increased pain scores with gynecologic procedures include nulliparity, postmenopausal status, history of dysmenorrhea, anxiety, or high anticipated pain levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. As the IUD insertion process is generally quick (typically less than 3 minutes) and tolerable for women whose expectations have been appropriately set, we find that the majority of women do not require pain medication prior to IUD insertion.</p><p>During the procedure, we inform the patient about what is happening, what she should be feeling, and what is going to happen next. We also tell the patient when she should expect no sensation and can rest and recover, such as during glove changes or preparation of the IUD applicator. We find that providing distraction, such as asking about life outside of the examination room, or positive suggestion can be helpful. Support staff can also support the woman by holding her hand, talking to her, and providing her with comfort measures such as a cool compresses as needed. For patients who use anxiolytics for other indications, pretreatment with these medications before IUD insertion can be helpful. We find that patients do quite well with this approach because it allows them to feel prepared, in control, and to manage the mild discomfort of the insertion process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4240026532\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not routinely inject a paracervical block for IUD insertion, as the injection itself is painful, prolongs the procedure significantly, numbs only the lower nerve branches of uterine nerve plexus, and is of unclear benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, we offer paracervical block for patients who require additional cervical manipulation for IUD insertion (eg, cervical dilation) or in patients who are extremely nervous and may be calmed to know they are receiving some numbing medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Prior to block injection, we explain that the patient will feel the injection as well as some procedural discomfort.</p><p>Despite the conflicting literature, we offer periprocedural nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (eg, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 800 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 550 mg, based on medication availability and onset of action) for multiple reasons: (1) studying pain in a research setting can be challenging, and subject-reported pain at certain time-points on a visual analog scale may not capture the whole IUD insertion patient experience accurately; (2) there is biological plausibility for this treatment to improve cramping both with the procedure and in the hours after the procedure as the uterus accommodates the new IUD; (3) it is a safe therapy that presents minimal risk or side effects; and (4) it may provide the patient emotional comfort to know that her discomfort is being validated and an attempt at treatment is being made. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391311145\"><span class=\"h3\">Analgesia treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Analgesia treatments that have been studied for reduced discomfort with IUD insertion include multiple formulations of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, paracervical blocks, topical anesthetics (eg, gels and sprays), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a>, and conscious sedation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>NSAID</strong> &ndash; Multiple formulations and doses of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been studied for preprocedural analgesia at the time of IUD insertion with mixed results. A 2015 meta-analysis that evaluated seven trials of NSAIDs compared with placebo reported oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> reduced pain in one of two trials; oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> was not associated with pain reduction in four trials, including a trial of high-dose 800 mg ibuprofen; and intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> was associated with reduced pain after insertion for nulliparous but not multiparous patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Subsequent trials reported that preprocedure oral ketorolac 20 mg reduced discomfort with IUD insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], but preprocedure treatment with oral naproxen 550 mg did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, use of naproxen was associated with lower median postprocedure pain scores at both 5 and 15 minutes postinsertion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paracervical block</strong> &ndash; In a 2015 meta-analysis that assessed two trials comparing paracervical block with 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> to either no intervention or placebo (saline), both trials reported reduced pain with tenaculum placement, but only one trial noted reduced pain with IUD insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A subsequent 2017 multicenter single-blind, sham-controlled randomized trial of 10 mL 1% lidocaine paracervical block in 14- to 22-year-old adolescents and young women reported a significant decrease in IUD insertional discomfort in those women who received a paracervical block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The technique for paracervical block is presented elsewhere.

In a 2015 meta-analysis assessing pain reduction at the time of IUD insertion after placement of topical anesthetic compared with placebo, pain was reduced following use of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 4% gel, lidocaine 10% spray, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-and-prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine-prilocaine</a> cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Lidocaine 2% gel was not associated with pain reduction. A subsequent trial that compared topical lidocaine-prilocaine cream with placebo reported reduced pain with tenaculum placement, sound, and IUD insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a trial comparing lidocaine injection, lidocaine spray, and lidocaine cream with placebo, women receiving lidocaine spray and injection groups reported lower pain scores with insertion, but women who received spray reported a reduction in pain only associated with tenaculum placement, not IUD insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> &ndash; Based on its use of a cervical ripening agent, it has been hypothesized that misoprostol may facilitate IUD placement, particularly in nulliparous women. However, misoprostol has not been demonstrated to reduce insertional discomfort. Both a 2015 meta-analysis and a 2016 systematic review reported that misoprostol use consistently did <strong>not</strong><em> </em>reduce pain with IUD insertion. Misoprostol use was associated with more discomfort because of the abdominal cramping caused by this prostaglandin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of note, we do use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> in specific populations of women who benefit from cervical ripening.

A speculum is inserted, cervical cultures are performed if indicated (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Sexually transmitted infections'</a> above), and the cervix is cleaned with an antiseptic solution. If the clinician sees signs of active cervicitis, the procedure should be aborted and a diagnostic work-up should be initiated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tenaculum placement</strong> &ndash; IUD insertion begins by obtaining adequate grasp of the anterior lip of the cervix with a tenaculum. We strongly recommend a single-toothed tenaculum to control uterine movement and straighten out the uterine angle, which allows both the sound and the IUD to easily pass to the top of the fundus while minimizing risk of perforation or malpositioned placement. While there is insufficient evidence, anecdotal evidence suggests that having the patient cough or take a deep breath at time of tenaculum placement and closing the tenaculum slowly and incompletely may be more comfortable for the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women who are anticoagulated or who have a bleeding diathesis, we recommend an atraumatic tenaculum or ring instead of a single-tooth tenaculum. Holding anticoagulation therapy or adding prophylactic medication (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a>) is generally not required, as bleeding complications are rare even in these populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sound uterine cavity</strong> &ndash; The purpose of sounding the uterus before opening the IUD kit is to ensure that (1) cervical stenosis is not present or can be treated immediately to allow instrumentation of the uterus, (2) the patient will be able to tolerate the cramping associated with IUD placement, and (3) the uterine cavity is within the size range necessary for effective intrauterine contraception. Performing this step prior to opening the IUD kit avoids having to waste an expensive device if the pre-IUD insertion portions of the procedure cannot be successfully performed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While placing the tenaculum on gentle traction with the nondominant hand to straighten the uterine axis, a uterine sound is passed through the cervix to the uterine fundus in order to measure the depth of the uterine cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82457\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82457 \">figure 1</a>).

However, in clinical practice, this device is frequently used in larger cavities for both contraception and symptom management in patients with moderate fibroid disease or adenomyosis that may lengthen the cavity size. Given the mechanism of action and the highly effective nature of this device, we feel comfortable using the LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5</span> for contraception in uterine cavities up to 14 cm, and in even larger uteri for control of symptoms such as menorrhagia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/4</span> package insert allows for this clinical judgment, giving only a lower limit of cavity size of 5.5 cm and no upper limit on cavity length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The LNg 19.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/5</span> and LNg 13.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/3</span> do not give upper or lower limits of cavity size within the prescribing information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The CuT380A has a cavity size range of 6 to 9 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Ultrasound assessment of the uterine cavity with the sound in place can help distinguish between a small cavity and a sound that is stuck at the internal cervical os. If the provider is unsure if the uterine fundus was reached when they measured a small uterine cavity, ultrasound evaluation should be performed to measure the uterine cavity in order to help with IUD candidacy determination and IUD size considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Insertion of this device requires the clinician to use both hands when loading the IUD into the applicator and to touch the device while using sterile gloves. Alternately, the device can be loaded into the applicator by only touching the IUD through the outside of the partially opened sterile package. We most frequently open the package completely and touch the IUD with sterile gloves to load it, but we discuss both methods below.</p><p>The critical steps include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When using sterile gloves, the provider assembles the IUD by simultaneously bending both horizontal arms downwards to be parallel with the stem of the device and then tucks them into the clear tube to hold the arms (in this downward position) for easy entry through the cervical canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113685\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113685 \">figure 3</a>). In order to avoid IUD breakage or permanent device memory of the arms bent in this position, the horizontal arms should not be kept in this position in the clear insertion tube for more than a few minutes before insertion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Neither the IUD nor the portion of the insertion tube that enters the uterus should ever be touched with a nonsterile hand. If sterile gloves are not available, the device can be assembled within the partially opened IUD package. The provider partially opens the package to the level of the lower aspect of the IUD stem. With careful handling the distal end of the insertion tube with a nonsterile hand and handling the device itself through the clear, sterile cellophane of the unopened end of the package, the arms of the IUD can be bent down to be parallel with the stem and inserted into the clear tube to hold them in place (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113685\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113685 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After positioning the IUD at one end of the insertion tube, the white plastic rod is passed through the opposite end, with the ringed end of the rod protruding from the base of the clear tube. Care should be taken to pass the rod only to the point where it just touches the IUD (it must touch the stem); pushing the rod further will expel the device from the insertion tube. If we are using sterile gloves and have already touched the IUD to load the arms, we actually hold the IUD in place with our index finger while the white rod is threaded to the level of the IUD stem to ensure the newly loaded IUD is not pushed out of the tube. The blue elliptical flange can then be slid along the insertion tube to position it corresponding to the sounded depth of the uterine cavity. The wide diameter of the flange is oriented in the same alignment as the horizontal arms of the IUD to allow correct orientation of the IUD upon insertion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While applying gentle traction on the tenaculum, the insertion tube is passed through the cervical os and up the full length of the uterine cavity to the point at which resistance is felt as the IUD reaches the top of the uterine fundus. This should also correspond with the flange meeting the external cervical os if it was properly set based on uterine sounding. Once the IUD is at the fundus, the tenaculum should be allowed to gently fall as the remaining portion of the insertion requires two hands. While holding the white plastic rod steady in space, the clear tube is drawn back as far as it will go until it hits the ring of the white rod, about 1 cm. This allows the arms of the IUD to deploy at the fundus. Recognize that the white rod is not an inserting tool; the IUD should <strong>not</strong> be pushed forward out of the insertion tube with the rod, as this would cause perforation through the fundus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57148\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57148 \">figure 4</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Next, while now holding the clear insertion tube steady in space, draw the white rod all the way out and set aside. The clear insertion tube should then be similarly drawn all the way out and set aside, and the strings will be seen protruding from the cervix. Removing the rod first followed separately by the tube decreases the risk that the strings may get caught on the rod and the IUD device would be inadvertently moved down in the fundus. If the IUD stem is visible within or protruding through the endocervical canal, it should be retrieved by pulling the strings and, if it has remained sterile, it may be reloaded and a reinsertion may be attempted. Of note, this is in contrast to hormonal IUDs that cannot be reloaded within their complicated handles. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After proper placement is confirmed by visualization of just the strings protruding from the os, the strings are carefully trimmed to approximately 2 to 3 cm. We suggest cutting the strings at least 2 cm long to leave enough length for the strings to soften and curve around the face of the cervix and project towards the cervical-vaginal fornix instead of along the length of the vagina. Additionally, we recommend cutting the strings with a curved scissor perpendicular to the thread length to minimize chance of sharp edges cut on a bias that could cause partner discomfort.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, there are four levonorgestrel-containing IUDs available in the United States. The LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5,</span> LNg 19.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/5,</span> and LNg 13.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/3</span> all have the same manufacturer, applicator, and insertion technique.

Using sterile technique, grasp the inserter handle underhanded with the dominant hand. Using your thumb, advance the blue slider on the handle forward as far as possible in the direction of the arrow, thus moving the insertion tube over the IUD body to load it into the insertion tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113683\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113683 \">figure 6</a>). This results in the tips of the arms meeting, extended up above the stem of the IUD. The strings are completely contained in the handle and do not need to be secured. The loaded handle should be held underhanded with the blue slider held in place at all times by the operator's thumb. The elliptical flange can be adjusted with the operator's sterilely gloved nondominant hand or by careful advancement over the grooved surface of the IUD plastic package to reflect the depth of the uterus, as measured with a uterine sound.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While applying gentle traction on the tenaculum with the nondominant hand, the loaded IUD applicator is then advanced through the cervix with the dominant hand until the flange is 1.5 cm from the cervix. Alternatively, some providers prefer to advance the loaded IUD applicator through the cervix until receiving tactile feedback of reaching the fundus and then pull back 1.5 cm. With the applicator held here, 1.5 cm from the stop of the fundus, the blue thumb slider is moved down 1 cm, stopping at the gray mark designated on the handle. This downward thumb slider movement allows the arms of the IUD to be released. We recommend a delay here of 3 to 10 seconds to allow the arms to relax back into the correct T-shaped configuration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113684\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113684 \">figure 7</a>). After this delay, the applicator is then advanced until the blue flange touches the cervix and resistance is felt to indicate that the IUD is correctly positioned at the top of the fundus. Holding the inserter in place, the IUD is released by moving the blue thumb slider all the way back down to the bottom of the handle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The inserter can then be gently removed entirely from the cervix, exposing the gray strings that should then be cut to 2 to 3 cm from the external cervical os. We suggest cutting the strings at least 2 cm long to leave enough length for the softened strings to curve around the face of the cervix and project towards the cervical-vaginal fornix instead of along the length of the vagina. Additionally, we recommend cutting the strings with a curved scissor perpendicular to the threat length to minimize chance of sharp edges cut on a bias that could cause partner discomfort. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While the new one-handed handle allows for an easier insertion, the fact that the strings are contained within the device means that the IUD cannot be reloaded within the applicator should the IUD be deployed or inserted incorrectly.

There are likely very few remaining nonexpired LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5</span> IUD available for placement. These insertion applicators have exposed strings outside the inserter handle, are potentially reloadable (though with difficulty), have a cleft at the lower end of the handle (which holds the IUD strings until the IUD is released), and the package has a blue stripe without the device image.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/4</span> IUD</strong> &ndash; In 2016, the LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/4</span> IUD (commercial name Liletta) manufacturer switched to a two-handed preloaded applicator that has an IUD that is partially loaded within the insertion tube with the strings extruding through the distal end of the tube. Instructional videos and documents for the insertion technique are available on the manufacturer's website [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The device must first be loaded. To begin, hold the device underhanded in the dominant hand and push your thumb up to ensure both the blue thumb slider and the green thumb slider are fully advanced as far up as they will go in the handle. The IUD can then be retracted into the insertion tube by laying the device's free arms flat (horizontal) on the sterile inside plastic surface of the package, placing the dominant thumb on the blue slider to keep it fully advanced with gentle pressure while simultaneously pulling the strings down firmly with the nondominant hand until the IUD slides completely into the tube with the arms extended up. The blue flange is then slid along the insertion tube to position it to correspond to the sounded depth of the uterine cavity using a sterile or no-touch technique. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once the IUD is loaded, it is ready for insertion. Using the nondominant hand, gentle traction is placed on the tenaculum while the loaded IUD applicator is then advanced through the cervix with the dominant hand until the flange is 1.5 cm from the cervix. For insertion into most uteri, we recommend that this applicator be held underhanded with the dominant thumb on the thumb slider at all times. With the applicator held 1.5 cm from the top of the fundus, the blue thumb slider is moved down 1 cm, stopping at the mark designated on the handle. This downward thumb slider movement allows the arms of the IUD to be released. We recommend a 3 to 10 second delay to allow the arms to relax back into the correct T-shaped configuration. After this delay, the applicator is then advanced until the blue flange touches the cervix and resistance is felt to indicate that the IUD is correctly positioned at the top of the fundus. Holding the inserter in place, the IUD is released by moving both blue and green thumb sliders all the way back down to the bottom of the handle. If the green slider is moved all the way down, a green indicator is exposed at the very base of the insertion handle to denote that the strings are free (no longer locked). The inserter can then be gently removed entirely from the cervical canal, exposing the blue strings that should then be cut to 2 to 3 cm. We suggest cutting the strings at least 2 cm long to leave enough length for the strings to soften and curve around the face of the cervix the cervical-vaginal fornix instead of along the length of the vagina.

If the stenosis is severe, a lacrimal duct probe can be used as a very thin dilator. Alternatively, a 3 mm flexible endometrial biopsy Pipelle can be used instead of a rigid metal sound to identify and dilate the canal. Analgesia such as a paracervical block may be warranted for cervical dilation or manipulation. At times, a circuitous path or cervical divots may allow easy passage of the smooth metal dilators or sound but prevent easy passage of the flexible plastic IUD applicator. In this setting, over dilation to 21 to 23 French can allow for unrestrictive passage of the flexible IUD inserter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other solutions for difficult entrance into the uterus include ultrasound guidance (see <a href=\"#H77827894\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound guidance'</a> below), use of a smaller IUD inserter (the LNg 19.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/5</span> and LNg 13.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/5</span> applicator diameter dimension is 3.8 mm compared with Mirena at 4.4 mm and Liletta at 4.8 mm), or rotating the IUD applicator 180 degrees to allow improved angling of the device applicator along the posterior uterine aspect, particularly in retroverted uteri. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77827894\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While not required for IUD placement, ultrasound guidance can be useful in resolving difficult IUD insertions. Specifically, ultrasound guidance can guide dilator insertion in women with cervical stenosis or a tortuous cervical canal. It can also identify distorted uterine anatomy such as sharp uterine flexion (anteverted or retroverted) or fibroids (particularly submucosal tumors). Additionally, ultrasound can be used immediately postinsertion to confirm correct IUD placement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77827925\"><span class=\"h3\">Misoprostol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not routinely used for IUD insertion, pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> may benefit some women, including those in whom IUD insertion is known to be difficult or has failed, or women who are nulliparous or have only had cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. However, routine use of misoprostol has <strong>not</strong> been demonstrated to increase the rates of successful IUD insertion. In a systematic review of six trials, routine pretreatment with misoprostol did not lead to improved ease or success of IUD insertion and resulted in more insertional discomfort, particularly in nulliparous patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As this lack of benefit for most patients must be balanced against uncomfortable side effects, we rarely prescribe misoprostol. We generally reserve misoprostol for women with a prior unsuccessful attempt at IUD insertion, presumed secondary to cervical stenosis.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> regimens vary; 400 mcg can be administered vaginally, buccally, or sublingually, ideally two to three hours before insertion. Side effects can include nausea, cramping, and diarrhea and tend to be higher in patients who receive sublingual dosing as compared with buccal or vaginal administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Given the convenience of buccal administration, as compared to vaginal dosing, and the improved side effect profile when compared with sublingual dosing, our preferred dosing regimen is misoprostol 400 mcg placed buccally at least two hours before the IUD procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTABORTION (INDUCED OR SPONTANEOUS) PLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IUDs can be inserted immediately after surgical uterine evacuation for pregnancy termination or miscarriage, or after confirmation of passage of the pregnancy in the setting of medical abortion or spontaneous miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Insertion of IUDs during these pregnancy events has several advantages: The timing is convenient as the patient is already receiving medical care; some of the insertion procedure steps overlap with the surgical abortion management, which minimizes IUD insertional time and risk; the patient may be highly motivated to avoid a repeat pregnancy; anesthesia provided for the uterine evacuation will help ease the IUD insertion experience; and the woman is known not to be pregnant at time of IUD placement. These benefits must be weighed against an elevated IUD expulsion rate when placed postpartum after first, second, and third trimester delivery. The optimal candidates for the different IUD insertion timings and the risk of IUD expulsion is discussed in detail separately (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods#H640923987\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;, section on 'Intrauterine contraception'</a>.)</p><p>While the general steps for postabortion IUD insertion are similar to the procedure described above for nonpregnant women, the clinician must make minor modifications to technique. IUD placement should not be performed if there is suspicion of endometritis or if a complication was encountered during the suction procedure, such as perforation or unresolved significant bleeding.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insertion following surgical pregnancy interruption in the first and second trimester</strong> &ndash; An IUD may be inserted immediately following a D&amp;C in the first trimester or a D&amp;E in the second trimester. Both progestin and copper IUDs can be used in these settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After uterine evacuation and prior to immediate postprocedure IUD insertion, the provider should verify that the evacuation is complete with no suspicion for retained products or ongoing bleeding. The method of insertion is highly similar to that with an interval procedure, with the primary differences being an already dilated cervix and a larger uterine cavity. Need for repeat cervical preparation with antiseptic after uterine evacuation and before IUD insertion is controversial, and there is limited evidence to support or refute the practice. Until further data are available, both approaches are reasonable. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Since the tenaculum is already in place for the D&amp;C, it should be left in place. Also, we don't sound the uterus in this setting. Since the cervix is already known to be adequately dilated to accommodate the IUD, the length of the uterine cavity is already known from the evacuation procedure, and the uterine size is irrelevant since it is going to change with involution, sounding the uterus provides one more opportunity for uterine perforation without much benefit. This is especially true if the uterine evacuation is performed under ultrasound guidance, as the clinician can see themselves correctly place the IUD in the fundus. Loading, inserting and deploying the IUD is all unchanged from the interval insertion process described above. The strings again can be cut to about 2 cm, but the patient should be warned that, with uterine involution, the strings may become too long and may need to be trimmed in a number of weeks in the clinic. This is especially true with placement after a second trimester procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insertion following medication interruption of pregnancy (spontaneous or induced abortion)</strong> &ndash; IUDs can be inserted after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> treatment for a spontaneous abortion or after combined <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> and misoprostol for an induced abortion. Prior to insertion, complete abortion is confirmed either by demonstrating absence of a gestational sac on transvaginal ultrasound (typically 5 to 14 days after spontaneous or induced abortion) or by comparing the postprocedure hCG value with the hCG value obtained on the day of mifepristone administration (a &gt;80 percent drop in &gt;5 days is commonly used as a marker of complete medical abortion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of placing an IUD within one week of medication abortion, once confirmation of the gestation sac expulsion has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. A prospective cohort study of patients who had medication abortion followed by LNg or Cu380A IUD placement at the one-week follow-up visit reported low expulsion rates (4 percent) at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Similarly, a trial comparing placement of the Cu380A IUD at one week or six weeks following medication abortion reported the rates of IUD expulsion and continuation were the same between the two arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insertion following spontaneous abortion</strong> &ndash; Given the unpredictable nature of spontaneous miscarriage, there is limited literature to help guide practice of IUD insertion in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, there is biological plausibility to extrapolating the medication abortion literature noted above to the setting of spontaneous miscarriage. Therefore, once the gestational sac has passed <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there is a rapid decline in hCG values to indicate the great majority of the pregnancy has been expelled, we feel comfortable placing an IUD (assuming there are no other risk factors, such as infection). The hCG trend does not need to be followed to a negative value before an IUD can be placed, and the IUD should not affect the rate of hCG drop. Similarly, resumption of menses does not need to happen before we place the IUD. Once we can be reasonably assured that the pregnancy has passed based on patient symptoms, ultrasound evaluation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hCG trends, we immediately place an IUD if desired by the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1537309631\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTPARTUM INSERTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1127818180\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate post-placental insertion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate post-placental insertion is performed within 10 minutes after delivery of the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] and has been practiced and studied extensively following both vaginal and cesarean deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/49,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,54,55</a>]. However, while IUD insertion within 10 minutes of placenta delivery has been defined for guideline and research purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], there is no known limit as to how much time can pass between delivery of the placenta and safe IUD insertion. There may be no difference in clinical outcomes with longer placenta-to-insertion time intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Immediate post-placental insertion is well tolerated with or without regional analgesia (ie, epidural) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. </p><p>The main challenge of postplacental IUD insertion is placing of the IUD high in the fundus before the uterus regains so much tone that it prevents proper placement. Meta-analysis of continuation and expulsion outcomes demonstrates that immediate IUD placement following placenta delivery has higher expulsion rates than delayed or interval IUD placement. However, due to poor postpartum follow-up rates, the initiation and long-term continuation rates of IUDs placed immediately postpartum are ultimately significantly higher, and more women are ultimately protected with highly effective contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods#H961532810\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;, section on 'Insertion timing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insertion following vaginal delivery</strong> &ndash; Once the placenta has been delivered and uterine bleeding has stabilized, the cervix is visualized with the help of retractors or speculum and grasped with a ring forceps. The cervix is prepped with betadine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Next, we remove the IUD from the applicator with the strings intact and either gently place the device between the index and middle fingers of our dominant hand or we very gently grasp the IUD with a ring forceps. We prefer to place the IUD manually, rather than use the inserter, because the TCu380A inserter is typically too short and the LNg IUD applicators generally require manipulation within the vagina, which we find awkward. If the ring forceps are to be used, great care is to be taken to grasp the IUD with minimal pressure, as tightening the forceps may lead to a full break of the IUD or lead to enough damage to affect the rate of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> or copper ion release. Once the IUD is positioned in the dominant hand or ring forceps, the device is inserted into the cervix, passed through the entire length of the uterine cavity, and released at the top of the fundus. We typically perform postpartum insertion in the standing position and place our nondominant hand on the patient's abdomen to help stabilize the fundus. Once the IUD has been deposited at the fundus, we take care to remove the hand or the ring forceps without catching and pulling downward on the strings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The Cu380A IUD strings may not actually be long enough to extend all the way through the cervix and, even if they are, they likely do not need to be cut. The LNg IUD strings are typically long enough to extend through the cervix and may be cut, but should be deliberately kept long to keep them from migrating back up into the open cervix. Given the increased literature on the safety of immediate postpartum IUD insertion and the increase of IUD provision in this setting, specific postpartum IUD inserters are in development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115559\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115559 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insertion following cesarean delivery</strong> &mdash; IUD insertion after a cesarean delivery is similar to placement after vaginal delivery. Since uterine tone increases with time following removal of the placenta, it is likely best to minimize delay of insertion. To allow room for our hands or instruments, we typically do this before we start the hysterotomy repair. However, some clinicians find it helpful to start the hysterotomy repair and then place the IUD when repair is about halfway complete. Typically we are able to use the IUD applicator for insertion at time of cesarean. However, as with vaginal insertion, an alternative option is to remove the IUD and the intact strings from the applicator and secure the IUD with the dominant index and middle figure or the ring forceps. We place the IUD at the top of the fundus while controlling the uterus with our non-dominant hand. We then direct the strings towards the vagina using long forceps such as DeBakey, though we do no other measures to directly bring the strings through the cervix. IUD strings migrate down through the cervix in about a half of the patients who have it placed at time of cesarean delivery and can be visualized during speculum examination at the postpartum visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. For those patients in whom strings cannot be seen at the postpartum visit, the IUD is likely in the fundus but the strings are in the lower uterus or cervix. We perform an office ultrasound to check for IUD location and reassure the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H702523149\"><span class=\"h2\">Delayed postpartum IUD insertion</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early-delayed</strong> &ndash; Early-delayed IUD insertion is less common and generally is performed when a woman expressed her desire for an IUD after delivery but prior to discharge (between 10 minutes and one week after delivery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. During this time, uterine tone is quite strong but involution is not yet completed. The insertion technique for early delayed postpartum insertion is the same as the immediate postpartum insertion above. (See <a href=\"#H1127818180\" class=\"local\">'Immediate post-placental insertion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Late-delayed</strong> &ndash; Late delayed insertion typically refers to insertion intervals of a few weeks postpartum, but less than six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Intervals of two to three weeks have been studied and demonstrate feasibility without adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Since patient surveys report that a majority of postpartum patients resume intercourse before six weeks post-partum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>], shortening the post-partum insertion window is desirable to prevent unintended pregnancy.

For an interested patient, we offer her the cut string fragment to feel at time of IUD placement so she can familiarize herself with how the strings feel should she want to do a digital self-examination to reassure herself that she can feel the strings at her cervix in the future. She should be told that if she cannot feel the string, she should use a back-up method of contraception until she can be examined by her clinician to confirm whether the IUD is in place.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Timing of insertion and pregnancy testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We counsel all women about STI risk and offer voluntary screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia to all women presenting for IUD insertion regardless of risk factors. Additionally, we routinely recommend screening women based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/prevention/screeningreccs.htm&amp;token=7/sDq8EttCAPckeysg/UmYytOIJ27df7gTnINoq8sXpK3WDsgwkBRTu13cnkfvqIjS6RE45y+rF3xEXtxDdZFQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3267\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">STD &amp; HIV Screening Recommendations</a>. If no evidence of acute pelvic infection is present, STD screening should not delay IUD insertion. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Sexually transmitted infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis for the placement of an IUD is not recommended, even for women with valvular heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not routinely inject a paracervical block for IUD insertion, as the injection itself is painful and is of unclear benefit. Despite the conflicting literature, we do offer patients nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 800 mg or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 550 mg, based on medication availability and onset of action) either before or after IUD insertion. Pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> does not reduce insertion pain. (See <a href=\"#H1890302906\" class=\"local\">'Analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following equipment is required for routine IUD insertion: sterile, packaged IUD device, speculum, single tooth tenaculum, uterine sound (either metal sound or alternative like a 3mm flexible endometrial biopsy pipelle), scissor (ideally long with curved blade), an antiseptic solution (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>. Ideally, sterile gloves should also be available, although a &quot;no touch&quot; technique is acceptable. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Equipment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General steps common to insertion of any IUD include examining the pelvis, placing a tenaculum on the cervix, and sounding the uterine cavity. (See <a href=\"#H14673755\" class=\"local\">'General steps for IUD insertion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The IUD insertion process varies by device. The clinician should be familiar with the specific steps for the various devices. (See <a href=\"#H778917281\" class=\"local\">'Device-specific insertion steps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women in whom the IUD insertion was difficult or failed, cervical dilators and ultrasound guidance can aid insertion. We do not routinely pretreat women with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> prior to IUD insertion, but misoprostol pretreatment can be helpful in select women. (See <a href=\"#H77827807\" class=\"local\">'Difficult insertion'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IUDs can be inserted immediately after surgical uterine evacuation for pregnancy termination or miscarriage, or after confirmation of passage of the pregnancy in the setting of medical abortion or spontaneous miscarriage. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Postabortion (induced or spontaneous) placement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IUDs can be inserted following vaginal or cesarean delivery. Immediate post-placental insertion is preferred because of the higher initiation and continuation rates, although expulsion rates are also higher compared with delayed or interval insertion. (See <a href=\"#H1537309631\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum insertion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postinsertion counseling includes a discussion of concerning symptoms and use of back-up contraception as indicated.
