With the identification of the gene defects in many of these disorders, the diagnosis now is made more often by genetic testing.</p><p>The hereditary ataxias have traditionally been divided into two main classes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ataxia caused by underlying inborn errors of metabolism; these disorders usually are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and typically present in childhood. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive degenerative ataxias not due to inborn errors of metabolism. This group of disorders, which are more common, are divided by their mode of inheritance into autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial forms.</p><p/><p>The hereditary ataxias caused by inborn errors of metabolism and the episodic, X-linked, and mitochondrial ataxias are discussed in this topic.</p><p>The National Ataxia Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.ataxia.org/&amp;token=Kaq/fgbW/9pbBBRAhFwle2C/R2qPaAByA3syS3dsm3g=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6234\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.ataxia.org</a>), the Friedreich Ataxia Research Alliance (<a href=\"http://www.curefa.org/&amp;token=RQvgI4CUD+onN4/T61VwBogcruKq67G6RNpM8lM23zQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6234\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.curefa.org</a>), and other nonprofit organizations provide important information for patients and the larger public.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT ATAXIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common autosomal dominant ataxias are the spinocerebellar ataxias. Other causes include dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), which is common in Japan, and the ataxic variant of the Gerstmann-Str&auml;ussler-Scheinker syndrome, a prion disease. These disorders are briefly reviewed here, and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-spinocerebellar-ataxias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The spinocerebellar ataxias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More than 20 types of spinocerebellar ataxia (and the number probably will continue to grow) with characteristic clinical and genetic abnormalities have been identified. Rather than representing an enzyme deficiency, some of these disorders are caused by trinucleotide (or, in SCA10, pentanucleotide) repeat expansion within the disease-causing gene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74269\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74269 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The most common are CAG repeats in the coding region that encode for polyglutamine tracts in the protein products, similar to that seen in Huntington disease. Expansion of CAG repeats is thought to produce a toxic &quot;gain of function&quot; (ie, disease develops because the mutant form of the protein gains a new function, not because the protein loses its normal function). The repeats show both somatic and germline instability. As a result, successive generations of affected families experience anticipation, a phenomenon characterized by earlier onset and a progressively worse phenotype in subsequent generations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE ATAXIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common autosomal recessive ataxias are Friedreich ataxia and ataxia-telangiectasia. These are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=friedreich-ataxia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Friedreich ataxia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ataxia-telangiectasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ataxia-telangiectasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Less frequent causes are xeroderma pigmentosum and Cockayne syndrome which, like ataxia-telangiectasia, are caused by defects in DNA repair mechanisms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropathies associated with hereditary disorders&quot;, section on 'DNA repair disorders'</a>.)</p><p>All of these disorders at some point have prominent non-neurologic manifestations, but Friedreich ataxia and ataxia-telangiectasia may be confused in the early stages of the disease. Diagnostic criteria have been proposed for ataxia-telangiectasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57053\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57053 \">table 2</a>), and the two disorders can be distinguished by genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>As already noted, ataxias due to underlying inborn errors of metabolism usually are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

Some are pure cerebellar syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], while others encompass additional neurologic abnormalities such as spasticity, deafness, intellectual disability (mental retardation), or dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. The genetic loci remain unknown in most of these disorders, with the exception of an early onset X-linked ataxia that is associated with deafness and loss of vision and links to locus Xq21.2-q24 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although the X-linked diseases primarily are expressed in males, a small percentage of females have some symptoms because of skewed inactivation of the X chromosome bearing the normal allele. Other patients have ataxia combined with systemic abnormalities such as sideroblastic anemia and adrenal insufficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia is a recessive disorder characterized by relatively mild anemia, unresponsiveness to pyridoxine, and nonprogressive cerebellar ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

The role of the ABCB7 protein in erythroid cells and the proposed mechanisms by which ABCB7<em> </em>mutation causes sideroblastic anemia are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-the-sideroblastic-anemias#H1876422901\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of the sideroblastic anemias&quot;, section on 'X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia (ABCB7 mutation)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-the-sideroblastic-anemias#H1174919368\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of the sideroblastic anemias&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenoleukodystrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive ataxia and incoordination is an atypical presentation of adrenoleukodystrophy, an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by progressive neurologic dysfunction and primary adrenal insufficiency. This disorder is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenoleukodystrophy#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenoleukodystrophy&quot;, section on 'Other presentations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MITOCHONDRIAL ATAXIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain mitochondrial disorders can present with a progressive or intermittent ataxia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Leigh syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leigh syndrome (subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder of infancy or childhood that is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropathies associated with hereditary disorders&quot;, section on 'Leigh syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Summarized briefly, this disorder is characterized by developmental delay or psychomotor regression, signs of brainstem dysfunction, ataxia, dystonia, external ophthalmoplegia, seizures, lactic acidosis, vomiting, and weakness. Peripheral neuropathy with reduced nerve conduction velocity and demyelination also are frequent findings. The prognosis is poor, with survival often being a matter of months after disease onset. Histologic examination reveals bilateral, symmetric necrotizing lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, brainstem, and spinal cord. Magnetic resonance imaging shows abnormal white matter signal in the putamen, basal ganglia, and brainstem with T2 images.</p><p>The Leigh syndrome phenotype appears to be related to altered mitochondrial metabolism. Alterations in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), or in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been associated with autosomal, X-linked, or mtDNA mutations (maternally-inherited Leigh syndrome). A deficiency in cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the fourth multisubunit complex of the respiratory chain, is a common finding that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Mutations in SURF1, a gene located on chromosome 9q34, have been identified in many COX deficient patients with Leigh syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropathies associated with hereditary disorders&quot;, section on 'Leigh syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Ataxia and myoclonus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ataxia and myoclonus can be produced by a variety of mitochondrial lesions. They include large deletions and duplications characteristic of Kearns-Sayre syndrome and maternally-inherited point mutations in mitochondrial genes encoding tRNA, the MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) and MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers) syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. In MELAS, for example, the genetic defect alters amino acid incorporation into the subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system that are synthesized in the mitochondria, resulting in altered function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In MERRF, on the other hand, an impairment in mitochondrial calcium homeostasis occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ATAXIAS CAUSED BY INBORN ERRORS OF METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous hereditary ataxias appear to be caused by inborn errors of metabolism. These ataxias tend to have recessive inheritance, as enzymatic activity of 50 percent in heterozygotes is sufficient for most metabolic pathways to proceed.</p><p>The metabolic pathways involved in these disorders typically have numerous functions. As a result, ataxia is just one component of the clinical phenotype, which, taken as a whole, often points toward the underlying defect. The clinical phenotype can be divided into two general groups: the intermittent ataxias that occur with exacerbations of the underlying biochemical abnormal and the chronic progressive ataxias that are induced by specific enzyme deficiencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56126 \">table 3</a>). A review of the individual disorders is beyond the scope of this discussion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent ataxias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of intermittent ataxias are the aminoacidurias resulting from mutations in urea cycle enzymes, which lead to hyperammonemia and disorders of pyruvate and lactate metabolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56126 \">table 3</a>). Affected infants with all of these conditions typically display intellectual disability (mental retardation) and developmental delay. Nevertheless, establishing the correct diagnosis is important because supportive measures differ.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Urea cycle enzyme deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates with urea cycle enzyme deficiencies typically present with acute neurologic deterioration and hypotonia. Older children may have clumsiness, vomiting, and headaches. In addition, seizures, involuntary movements, and ptosis can occur at the peaks of hyperammonemia, usually induced by stress or ingestion of protein. Inheritance of urea cycle deficits is autosomal recessive, with the important exception of the relatively common ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, which is X-linked. However, some female carriers with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) convert less ammonia nitrogen to urea and are symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urea-cycle-disorders-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urea cycle disorders: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Aminoacidurias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ataxia may be seen in children with aminoaciduria, such as intermittent branched-chain ketoaciduria and isovaleric acidemia. This ataxic picture often is combined with seizures, episodic vomiting, and lethargy, similar to that seen in children with urea cycle deficits. The urine usually has a characteristic odor.</p><p>Hartnup disease is a pathogenetically different cause of ataxia, resulting from a defect in renal and intestinal transport of neutral amino acids rather than a metabolic defect. This disorder also is associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b3-niacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">niacin</a> deficiency, often leading to symptoms of pellagra (such as rash and confusion). Hartnup disease results from mutations in the SLC6A19 gene, which encodes for a sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter that is primarily expressed in the kidney and intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Disorders of pyruvate and lactate metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency, a less common cause of metabolic intermittent ataxia, is characterized by lactic acidosis, seizures, intellectual disability (mental retardation), ataxia, and spasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This condition typically is caused by a mutation in PDHA1, the gene for the E1 alpha subunit of the PDH enzyme complex (Xp22.2-p22.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Other less common genetic defects associated with PDH deficiency have been reported, including mutations in the E1 beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], E2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and E3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] subunits, the E3 binding protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and in the PDH phosphatase enzyme that regulates the PDH complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Biotin-responsive multiple carboxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive ataxia, characterized by ketoacidosis, dermatitis, seizures, myoclonus, and nystagmus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The infantile form can be caused by a variety of mutations in the holocarboxylase synthetase gene at locus 21q22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. This enzyme catalyzes the fixation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biotin-vitamin-h-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">biotin</a> to inactive apocarboxylases, producing four active carboxylases (including pyruvate carboxylase). In children with late onset (usually juvenile) disease, the defect appears to lie in biotinidase, which catalyzes the removal of biotin from the carboxylases, thereby generating biotin for reutilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The biotinidase gene is located on chromosome 3p25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic ataxias usually are diagnosed by screening biochemical tests when the neurologic abnormalities are first noticed. Based on a positive family history, OTC deficiency and several of the hyperammonemias can be diagnosed from blood samples taken in utero. Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency can, in addition, be corroborated by a relatively simple biochemical assay on cultured fibroblasts. Despite the identification of individual gene defects, genetic testing, at least at present, is impractical because of the numerous mutations in the relevant genes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the underlying defect usually cannot be corrected, many of the intermittent ataxias can be indirectly treated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive therapy for the urea cycle disorders consists of hydration and dietary protein restriction. No treatment exists for the underlying enzyme deficiency in these disorders except for liver transplantation or, perhaps in the future, hepatocyte transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

Both infantile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>] and late onset multiple carboxylase deficiency can be treated with pharmacologic doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biotin-vitamin-h-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">biotin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/33,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,42,43</a>].

These disorders typically present in later childhood or adolescence, unlike the intermittent ataxias. The probable explanation for this difference is that cumulative damage must reach a threshold before the clinical signs appear.</p><p>Storage diseases predominate in this group and include Niemann-Pick disease type C, Wilson disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, the heterogeneous ceroid lipofuscinosis and hexosaminidase deficiencies (eg, Tay-Sachs disease, Sandhoff disease), and <span class=\"nowrap\">adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56126 \">table 3</a>).

Additional features include splenomegaly and large, lipid-laden foam cells in bone marrow.

Several hereditary ataxias also are associated with vitamin E deficiency. The neurologic injury in these disorders may be related to low vitamin E content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency (AVED) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the alpha tocopherol transfer protein gene on chromosome 8q13.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>].

The disease is caused by mutations in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-hereditary-ataxias/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Defective assembly and secretion of apolipoprotein B (apo B) and apo-B-containing lipoproteins leads to impaired fat absorption, very low serum concentrations of cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride, and absent serum beta lipoprotein. The neurologic manifestations include progressive retinal degeneration (caused by coexisting vitamin A deficiency), peripheral neuropathy, and ataxia. Supplementation with vitamin E and the other fat-soluble vitamins early in the clinical course may improve the neuropathy and retinopathy.

It is characterized by a block in bile acid synthesis caused by mutations in the mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase gene on chromosome 2q33. The clinical manifestations include ataxia, neuropathy, cataracts, Achilles tendon xanthomas, and accelerated atherosclerosis. The diagnosis is suggested by elevated serum cholestanol in the presence of normal serum cholesterol and can be confirmed by genetic testing. Cholestanol is thought to be responsible for the neurologic toxicity. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chenodeoxycholic-acid-chenodiol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chenodeoxycholic acid</a> can markedly reduce both serum and cerebrospinal fluid cholestanol and appears to halt progression of the disease.

It should be suspected when a patient with autosomal recessive ataxia presents with the additional triad of ichthyosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and neuropathy. Patients with classic Refsum disease are unable to degrade phytanic acid due to deficient activity of phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (PhyH) caused by mutations in the PHYH gene. Strict reduction in dietary phytanic acid intake may be associated with a significant improvement in both the peripheral neuropathy and ataxia.
