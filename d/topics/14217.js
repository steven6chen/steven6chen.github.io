MAS can present with varying degrees of severity from mild respiratory distress to life-threatening respiratory failure. Coordination of care between the obstetric and neonatal team is important to reduce the incidence of MAS, and to identify and provide emergent therapy in those who develop MAS to reduce morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The prevention, management, and outcome of MAS will be reviewed here.

Evaluation and interventions are implemented in cases with abnormal tracings indicative of fetal stress. Although the combination of a nonreassuring FHR tracing and thick meconium in amniotic fluid has been associated with an increased risk of MAS, the value of intrapartum fetal monitoring to predict fetal hypoxemia and subsequent intervention in cases with abnormal traces in preventing MAS has not been proven.

For women greater than 41 weeks of gestation, we suggest induction of labor rather than expectant management. Evidence demonstrating a decreased incidence of MAS due to a reduction in the number of postmature births is discussed separately.

The proposed benefits of amnioinfusion include dilution of thick clumps of meconium by the instilled fluid, and possible prevention or relief of cord compression. However, amnioinfusion is not beneficial in reducing meconium-related neonatal morbidity, with the possible exception of settings with limited facilities to monitor the fetus during labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result, amnioinfusion is <strong>not</strong> recommended as a routine approach for mothers with meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF).

However, evidence from a large randomized controlled trial did not find a benefit of intrapartum suctioning in infants with MSAF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>In this study, 2514 infants of at least 37 weeks gestation with cephalic (vertex) presentation and MSAF of any consistency were randomly assigned to suctioning of the oropharynx, nasopharynx, and hypopharynx or no suctioning before delivery of the shoulders.

Rates of MAS (3.2 versus 2.7 percent) and other respiratory disorders (3.8 versus 4.5 percent) did not differ between groups. Of the 1098 infants who were successfully intubated, including 64 in the expectantly managed group, 3.8 percent had complications that usually were transient. These included bradycardia, hoarseness or stridor, and laryngospasm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis reported similar results that tracheal suctioning was not shown to be superior to routine resuscitation in vigorous term meconium-stained infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Additional evidence also suggests that endotracheal suctioning of <strong>nonvigorous</strong> neonates with MSAF is not beneficial. Two Indian trials of nonvigorous meconium-stained term infants found no additional benefit to infants who were assigned to endotracheal suctioning versus those who were assigned to no suctioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In these two studies, there were no differences between the two groups in either the incidence of MAS or mortality. The 2015 updated guidelines from the AHA, AAP, and ILCOR do not recommend routine endotracheal suction for nonvigorous infants with MSAF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The care of these infants should be guided by the same general principles for further intervention including endotracheal intubation, which are based on inadequate respiratory effort (gasping, labored breathing, or poor oxygenation) or heart rate (&lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80621\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80621 \">algorithm 1</a>). These guidelines were revised due to the emphasis of preventing harm (eg, delay in providing ventilation and preventing complications of intubation) and insufficient evidence that routine endotracheal suction is beneficial in this setting.

All 19 patients with MAS had signs of respiratory distress within 15 minutes of birth, which required ventilatory support in 16 of the infants. These results demonstrate that full-term infants with MSAF without any sign of respiratory distress or depression immediately after birth are unlikely to develop MAS.</p><p>As a result, in our practice, infants with MSAF who exhibit signs of respiratory distress in the delivery room are observed in the NICU or Special Care Nursery for four to six hours to ensure they transition successfully.

Hypoxemia should be avoided because it contributes to pulmonary vasoconstriction and possibly PPHN. Umbilical arterial and venous (multiple lumen) catheters are used to monitor arterial blood gases and blood pressure, and infuse fluids and medications.

When FiO<sub>2</sub> exceeds 0.4 to 0.5, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may improve oxygenation. However, CPAP should be used cautiously in infants with hyperinflation as it may exacerbate air trapping. A study from India suggested that CPAP may be beneficial, but findings are limited because of potential bias, as the clinicians caring for the infants were not blinded, the control group had a high rate of confounding factors (sepsis and shock), and no data were provided on the use of concomitant interventions such as antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The goal for assisted ventilation is to achieve optimal gas exchange with minimal respiratory trauma. In infants with MAS, we typically target PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels between 50 to 55 mmHg and arterial PO<sub>2</sub> between 55 to 90 mmHg (SaO<sub>2</sub> &gt;90 percent).

Surfactant may also be helpful in infants with radiographic evidence of surfactant dysfunction (eg, low lung volumes and homogeneous pulmonary parenchymal disease that is similar in appearance to respiratory distress syndrome [RDS]).</p><p>Data are insufficient to determine whether lung lavage with diluted surfactant is beneficial. A meta-analysis that included three trials reported no differences in the two separate outcomes of mortality and the use of ECMO for patients treated with surfactant lavage and controls, but the lavage group had a better outcome with a composite outcome of death or the use of ECMO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-meconium-aspiration-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, this study was limited by methodological issues due to the small number of patients, and the differences in study design (eg, severity of disease, volume of lavage, and use of subsequent bolus of surfactant).

However, birth depression occurs in 20 to 30 percent of patients with MAS, and it is likely intrauterine asphyxia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infection that are the major underlying pathologic factors resulting in poor neurodevelopmental outcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264557318\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is defined as respiratory distress in newborn infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) whose symptoms cannot be otherwise explained. In severe cases, MAS can be life threatening. As a result, it is important to reduce the incidence of MAS and provide emergent therapy to reduce the mortality in those who develop MAS.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interventions used to prevent MAS include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest that intrapartum fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring to detect episodes of fetal hypoxia be used in pregnancies with meconium-stained amniotic fluid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Although fetal hypoxia is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of MAS, the value of intrapartum fetal monitoring and subsequent intervention in cases with abnormal traces in preventing MAS has not been proven. (See <a href=\"#H182584932\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of fetal hypoxia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women &ge;41 weeks of gestation, we recommend induction rather than expectant management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H182585387\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of postmature delivery'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postterm-pregnancy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postterm pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dilution of thick meconium with amnioinfusion has not been shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of MAS. As a result, we do <strong>not</strong> suggest amnioinfusion as a routine intervention for mothers with MSAF unless there are coincident variable fetal heart rate decelerations (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H182584924\" class=\"local\">'Intrapartum management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>At delivery, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend intrapartum suction for MSAF (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H182586550\" class=\"local\">'Obstetrical care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After delivery, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend endotracheal intubation and suctioning of newborn infants born through MSAF (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This recommendation includes both vigorous and nonvigorous infants.(See <a href=\"#H182584961\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who develop MAS exhibit signs of respiratory distress immediately after birth. In our practice, infants with MSAF who exhibit signs of respiratory distress in the delivery room are typically observed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or Special Care Nursery for four to six hours to ensure that they transition successfully. Asymptomatic infants with Apgar scores &ge;9 are admitted to the normal nursery without additional monitoring or intervention. (See <a href=\"#H182584976\" class=\"local\">'Post-delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of MAS is supportive. In our practice, we suggest the following approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintenance of adequate oxygenation and ventilation &ndash; Respiratory management is focused on maintaining adequate oxygenation and ventilation, especially as hypoxemia, acidosis, and hypercapnia may increase pulmonary vascular resistance and contribute to the development of persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPHN). Supplemental oxygen therapy is usually adequate in patients with mild or moderate disease. In patients with severe disease, interventions may include mechanical ventilation, surfactant therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitric oxide</a> (iNO) therapy. In patients with respiratory failure who have failed to respond to other interventions, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be a life-saving intervention. (See <a href=\"#H182586256\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintenance of adequate blood pressure and perfusion with sufficient vascular volume, and in some patients, the use of vasopressor agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dopamine</a>. Transfusion of packed red blood cells is also required to replace blood lost from sampling and to optimize tissue oxygen delivery. In our practice, the hemoglobin level is generally maintained at 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span>. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Circulatory support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Correction of any metabolic abnormality including hypoglycemia, acidosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrolyte derangements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The administration of empirical antibiotic therapy while awaiting the results of blood cultures because it is difficult to differentiate MAS from bacterial pneumonia and sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Care in a neutral thermal environment for infants without evidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Minimal handling of the infant to avoid agitation, which may exacerbate PPHN, if present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mortality rate of MAS has improved because of advances in neonatal care. In survivors, long-term morbidity includes pulmonary sequelae, particularly reactive airway disease, and neurodevelopmental impairment. However, it is likely that intrauterine hypoxia and chronic infection, which are possible contributors to MAS, are the major underlying factors that result in poor neurodevelopmental outcome in patients with MAS.
