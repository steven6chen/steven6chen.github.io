In this group of patients, the impact of the severity of renal disease is particularly evident. This was illustrated in a prospective study of children with CKD due to renal <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoplasia/dysplasia</span> followed from birth to 10 years of age that showed a slightly but continuously lower annual growth rate in patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m&sup2; compared with patients with a higher GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-growth-impairment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Multiple variate analysis demonstrated that decreasing GFR was a significant contributor to poor growth.</p><p>Other factors such as inadequate nutrition appear to be less important factors for poor growth in this age group compared with infancy. In addition, catch-up growth appears to be suppressed in a uremic milieu. It has been proposed that this percentile-parallel growth pattern during the mid-childhood period reflects a net balance between the growth suppressive effect of uremia and the inherent tendency for catch-up growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-growth-impairment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H750239\"><span class=\"h3\">Puberty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of puberty is usually delayed in adolescents with CKD by an average of 2 to 2.5 years, and approximately two-thirds of adolescents with CKD stage 5 enter puberty beyond the normal age range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-growth-impairment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

This reduction in height gain is due to a marked suppression of the late pre-spurt height velocity, a subnormal peak height velocity, and a shortening of the pubertal growth period by one year in boys and 1.5 years in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-growth-impairment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Notably, the prolonged prepubertal growth phase, resulting from the delayed onset of the pubertal growth spurt, permits the patients to grow to an almost normal immediate pre-spurt height. However, relative height is subsequently lost during the shortened and less robust pubertal growth spurt, resulting in an average postpubertal Z-height score of -2.9 standard deviations (SD) in males and -2.3 SD in females with CKD stage 5.</p><p>In subsequent studies with advances in CKD management, most children requiring RRT before puberty have normal or only slightly delayed pubertal onset. In two studies, mean age at pubertal onset as well as age at menarche did not differ between children on RRT and healthy children, and serum levels of pubertal reproductive hormones were normal in the great majority of patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-growth-impairment-in-children-with-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/17,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,67</a>].
