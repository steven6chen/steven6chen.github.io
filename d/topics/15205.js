These must represent a decline from previous level of function and be severe enough to interfere with daily function and independence. As the global population ages, dementia prevalence is expected to rise substantially over the next several decades, especially in low- to middle-income countries.</p><p>Two major reports released in 2017 review the literature on potentially modifiable risk factors for dementia and highlight strengths and weaknesses in the available data to support the impact of risk factor modification on dementia incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. While the overall evidence is generally of low quality and does not support any single intervention as effective in delaying or preventing dementia, there is optimism that intensive risk factor modification, especially during midlife (age 45 to 65 years), has the potential to delay or prevent a substantial number of dementia cases worldwide. In support of this, large population-based studies indicate that the incidence of dementia has declined in high-income countries over the last several decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>].</p><p>The Lancet Commission estimates that approximately 35 percent of dementia cases are attributable to a combination of nine potentially modifiable risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low educational attainment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midlife hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midlife obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late-life depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical inactivity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social isolation</p><p/><p>This topic will review the risk factors associated with cognitive decline and dementia.

The incidence of AD approximately doubles every 10 years after the age of 60 years. Overall, approximately 85 percent of dementia cases are in adults 75 years of age and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Dementia is estimated to be present in one-half to two-thirds of nursing home residents.

A number of studies have found that dementia incidence continues to increase with age after 85 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. These cumulative increases in incidence rates result in the prevalence of dementia approaching or exceeding 50 percent in individuals over 90 years.</p><p>AD and other neurodegenerative dementias also occur, albeit rarely, in younger patients. The reported incidence of AD in one study from England was 4.2 cases per 100,000 person-years among individuals aged 45 to 64 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], while the overall incidence of early-onset dementia in this and another study was 11 to 13 cases per 100,000 person-years for adults younger than 64 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Among 235 individuals aged 17 to 45 years diagnosed with dementia in Rochester, Minnesota, neurodegenerative disease accounted for 31 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

A parental history of dementia is associated with an approximately twofold increase in the relative risk of dementia and AD, independent of known genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Risk estimates gradually decline with advancing parental age at diagnosis of dementia, with little to no increased risk when a parent is diagnosed after the age of 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The genetic basis for AD is understood most clearly in the early-onset form; while it accounts for less than 1 percent of cases, it follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern related to mutations in genes that alter amyloid-beta (A&beta;) protein production, aggregation, or clearance, including amyloid precursor protein (<em>APP</em>), presenilin 1 (<em>PSEN1</em>), and presenilin 2 (<em>PSEN2</em>).</p><p>The genetic basis of late-onset AD is more complex, with susceptibility likely conferred by a variety of more common but less penetrant genetic factors such as apolipoprotein E (<em>APOE</em>) alleles interacting with environmental and epigenetic influences. The genetic basis of AD is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-alzheimer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of Alzheimer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A family history of dementia is commonly present in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) as well. Mutations in genes such as <em>C9ORF72, MAPT, </em>and <em>GRN </em>together explain approximately 15 percent of familial FTD.

In a prospective study of 218 patients with spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage who were free of preexisting dementia and alive at six months posthemorrhage, the incidence of dementia was 14 percent at one year and 28 percent at four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In the first study, the risk of dementia was more than twofold higher among patients with lobar hemorrhage compared with nonlobar hemorrhage (23 versus 9 percent at one year); additional risk factors included older age, disseminated superficial siderosis, cortical atrophy, and higher number of cerebral microbleeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The association is present for both vascular dementia and AD, although the magnitude of risk may be higher for vascular dementia. Higher glucose levels have also been associated with risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in nondiabetic individuals, implicating insulin resistance more broadly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Among patients with diabetes, an inverse correlation has been noted between glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels and some cognitive measures, suggesting that worse glycemic control may be associated with greater cognitive decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. However, one study associated a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes with dementia risk among a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], suggesting some caution is appropriate in pursuing tight glycemic control in older adults.</p><p>It is not yet clear whether effective treatment of diabetes reduces dementia risk independent of other interventions. Cognitive outcomes, as measured by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, were not different among patients randomized to intensive glycemic control versus usual care in a study subset of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial when assessed at 40 months into the trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which diabetes may increase dementia risk is uncertain; it does not appear to be mediated entirely through vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].

In studies that attempted to control for the prodromal phase and the potential for reverse causation, two found an increased risk of dementia with benzodiazepine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/229,231\" class=\"abstract_t\">229,231</a>], while two others did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/232,233\" class=\"abstract_t\">232,233</a>].</p><p>The case for anticholinergics increasing risk of irreversible effects is probably stronger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/230,234\" class=\"abstract_t\">230,234</a>] and makes more sense physiologically given the prominence of cholinergic deficits in AD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2730871576\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstructive sleep apnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been associated with an increased risk for MCI and dementia in both cross-sectional and prospective observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/235-244\" class=\"abstract_t\">235-244</a>]. In a pooled analysis of six prospective studies in over 200,000 adults, those with sleep-disordered breathing were 26 percent more likely to develop clinically relevant cognitive decline or dementia (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.05-1.50) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/243\" class=\"abstract_t\">243</a>].</p><p>Most studies have observed higher risk among those with more severe OSA (ie, higher apnea-hypopnea index [AHI], more severe nocturnal oxygen desaturations), leading to the hypothesis that hypoxia may be a potential mechanism. Other studies suggest that OSA may accelerate cerebral amyloid deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/245,246\" class=\"abstract_t\">245,246</a>].</p><p>In one prospective study, a self-reported history of sleep apnea was associated with an earlier age of onset for both MCI (77 versus 90 years of age) and Alzheimer dementia (83 versus 88 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/239\" class=\"abstract_t\">239</a>]. Use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was associated with a delayed onset of MCI, although this observation might be explained by other factors related to an individual's likelihood to use CPAP.

A decreased percentage of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and other changes in sleep architecture have also been documented in older adults and have been associated with an increased risk of dementia over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/247\" class=\"abstract_t\">247</a>].

The overall quality of the evidence is limited in that most studies have used recent air pollution exposure as a surrogate for long-term exposure, and few studies have looked at within-person cognitive or pathologic change. Examples of studies implicating air pollution as a risk factor for dementia include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based study of 2.2 million adults aged 55 to 85 years living in Ontario, Canada identified nearly 250,000 cases of incident dementia from a large claims database from 2001 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/252\" class=\"abstract_t\">252</a>]. Residential address in 2001 was used as a proxy for exposure to air pollution, and dementia diagnoses were based on administrative database extraction and not individually verified. Individuals living in close proximity to high-traffic roads (&lt;50 meters) had an increased risk of dementia (adjusted OR 1.07), and the effect size was largest for those living in major cities (OR 1.12). No such associations were found for incident PD or multiple sclerosis. The study did not measure lead exposure, which might confound or contribute to the effects of air pollution in the decades before lead was removed from gasoline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/253,254\" class=\"abstract_t\">253,254</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a United States-wide cohort of older women enrolled in the prospective WHIMS, daily exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters &lt;2.5 microns (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) was assessed via the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air quality monitoring system and assigned based on residential address [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia/abstract/255\" class=\"abstract_t\">255</a>]. After adjusting for a wide range of potential confounders, including age, education, household income, lifestyle factors, and medical comorbidities, exposure to PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels exceeding EPA standards was associated with a nearly twofold higher risk of all-cause dementia (HR 1.92). The effect size was largest among women who were homozygous for <em>APOE</em> e4, although numbers were small (n = 81; HR 3.95, 95% CI 1.2-13.2). This study and others have focused on inflammation and increased amyloid deposition as potential mechanistic links between air pollution and AD, specifically.

Genetic risk plays an important role in both early-onset and late-onset forms of AD along with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, tobacco) have been linked to cognitive decline and all-cause dementia as well as to AD and vascular dementia individually. The associations are strongest when vascular risk factors are measured in midlife, rather than late life, and when multiple factors are present. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cardiometabolic risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence from observational studies suggests that low educational attainment, physical inactivity, and social isolation are associated with increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia. One theory holds that higher levels of education along with cognitive and social activity produce a cognitive reserve that decreases the impact of neurodegeneration on cognitive function. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle and activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other factors that might increase the risk of dementia include atrial fibrillation, excessive alcohol, chronic kidney disease and other medical illnesses, depression, head trauma, hearing loss, exposure to certain medications and toxins, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
