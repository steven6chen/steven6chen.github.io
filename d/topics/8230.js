Resort towns in the Western United States alone attract over 30 million visitors annually, generally to sleeping elevations of 2000 to 3000 m (6560 to 9840 feet). Many more millions visit cities at these elevations, including several large cities in South America and Asia situated above 3000 m (9840 feet) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most of these destinations can be reached within a day using modern means of transportation. Many of these mountain travelers are children.</p><p>Rapid ascents to high altitude place the unacclimatized child at risk for developing high altitude illness (HAI). Clinicians working in mountainous areas must familiarize themselves with the presentation and management of HAI in children, while all health care workers who advise travelers need to understand the best prevention strategies and treatment options. The clinician advising families with children on wilderness and high-altitude trips should offer an organized pre-trip evaluation that evaluates individual risk factors, provides recommendations for measures to prevent HAI, and determines whether prophylactic medication is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The risk of AMS depends upon individual susceptibility, the elevation reached, and the rate of ascent. Thus, while AMS is uncommon below 2000 m (6560 feet), it is quite common (approximately 25 percent incidence in adults and children) at sleeping elevations between 2000 and 3000 m (6560 to 9840 feet), where some cities and the majority of ski resorts in the Western United States are located (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63999\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63999 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50199 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. In most instances, pediatric high altitude illness (HAI) can be prevented with appropriate precautions or treated before serious illness, such as high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) or high altitude cerebral edema (HACE), occurs.</p><p>At higher altitudes, small observational studies initially suggested that AMS may occur more frequently in children and adolescents than in adults with ascent in a few hours from sea level to at elevations above 3500 m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/32,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36,37</a>]. However, larger studies have found either the same incidence as adults or less: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one observational study that evaluated the impact of fast ascent among families with 157 children ascending 3450 m in 2.5 hours, AMS in children was lower (30 percent), compared with adolescents (37 percent) and adults (45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, familial clustering was consistent and explained 25 to 50 of variability, the first evidence of hereditary influence for AMS. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a separate study of 48 children who underwent the same rapid ascent profile, AMS incidence was 25 percent at 6 hours, 21 percent at 18 hours, and 8 percent at 42 hours; all AMS was mild, and none required descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study took 118 children ages 6 to 16 in 2.5 hours to 3450 m in the Alps and found only a 6 percent incidence of AMS at 40 hours, confirming the rapid resolution of AMS without treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p/><p>Thus, the overall risk of AMS appears to be the same or less in children compared with adults, and as in adults, slower ascent rates reduce illness. </p><p>The epidemiology of AMS in adults is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute mountain sickness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AMS and HACE are generally considered to represent two points along a single spectrum of disease, with the same underlying pathophysiology. Although some aspects of this pathophysiology remain unclear, the concept that <span class=\"nowrap\">AMS/HACE</span> represents a continuum, and that AMS can progress to fatal HACE, fits with clinical experience and is helpful for management. However, especially in young children and infants, recognition of AMS is hampered by the difficulty in recognizing symptoms (eg, headache) in a nonverbal child. Certain pediatric patients (eg, infants under six weeks of age, children with congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, or Down syndrome) also have a greater susceptibility for life-threatening disease. (See <a href=\"#H2617016115\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations for children with pre-existing illnesses'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs of AMS in young children are nonspecific and include decreased playfulness, pallor, fussiness, poor sleep, vomiting, and decreased appetite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/26,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,33,34</a>].</p><p>In older children and adolescents, signs of HAI are similar to adults; the most common symptom is headache, which may be accompanied or followed by shortness of breath, dizziness, poor sleep, anorexia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The presentation and diagnosis of AMS in adults is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;, section on 'Presentation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The onset of AMS is usually delayed for 6 to 12 hours following arrival at high altitude but can occur as rapidly as 1 to 2 hours or as late as 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Symptoms are often most severe after the first night, generally resolve in one day if there is no further ascent, and do not recur at the same altitude. AMS may reappear upon ascent to higher altitudes. On occasion, symptoms of AMS may persist for days despite no further ascent. In such cases, descent is required if there is no improvement with standard treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;, section on 'AMS treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Supplemental oxygen may be used to support the clinical diagnosis of AMS. Providing 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> of oxygen by nasal cannula for 15 to 20 minutes prior to other interventions should markedly improve headache and other symptoms, as does a brief excursion to a lower altitude, especially in younger children.</p><p>The onset of symptoms more than two days after arrival at a given altitude, absence of headache, dyspnea at rest, and failure to improve rapidly with supplemental oxygen should prompt the clinician to search for an alternative diagnosis. No radiographic or laboratory testing is typically required, unless the diagnosis of AMS is unclear. Other etiologies to consider include carbon monoxide poisoning, migraine, dehydration, exhaustion, hyponatremia, viral syndrome, and bacterial infection (eg, pneumonia or otitis), and occult trauma such as corneal abrasion. In young children, AMS is a diagnosis of exclusion.</p><p>AMS alone does <strong>not</strong> cause an elevation in body temperature and an appropriate evaluation for fever based upon age and immunization status is warranted in febrile children at altitude. AMS is often a diagnosis of exclusion in this group. The clinician should pay close attention to the child's signs and response to oxygen, and when in doubt should err on the side of a longer observation period before attributing symptoms to a condition other than AMS.

In addition, certain individuals develop HAPE upon repeated ascents above the same altitude and may, therefore, have an altitude threshold beyond which they are susceptible to HAPE. Individuals who have experienced HAPE in the past have demonstrated genetic or physiological susceptibility and are therefore at risk for recurrence with ascent to the same altitude and at the same rate. Recurrence in these individuals may be avoided with a slower rate of ascent.</p><p>Of note, elevation in body temperature over 38.3&deg;C from HAPE alone is unusual; higher temperatures warrant evaluation for a concurrent infection or another diagnosis.

However, most healthy children do well <strong>without</strong> any serious effects at altitudes less than 3500 m (11,480 feet). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'High altitude physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthy children should ascend to very high altitudes (over 3500 m [11,480 feet]) slowly and only if rapid descent is possible in the event of problems. (See <a href=\"#H1231531\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations for ascent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children at particular risk for serious HAI include infants under six weeks of age; infants up to one year of age with a history of oxygen requirement or pulmonary hypertension, including premature infants; children who live at very high altitude and undergo a temporary descent; and children with Down syndrome, congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis or neuromuscular problems compromising ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H2847584\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H770595490\" class=\"local\">'High altitude cerebral edema'</a> above and <a href=\"#H230828376\" class=\"local\">'High altitude pulmonary hypertension'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a diagnosis of exclusion in preverbal children. Clinical manifestations of HAI are nonspecific in young children and infants and require a high index of suspicion for detection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66807\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66807 \">table 5</a>). Improvement of symptoms after administration of supplemental oxygen (eg, 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> by nasal cannula for 15 to 20 minutes) or a brief descent supports the diagnosis of AMS if not other cause of signs or symptoms is found. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of AMS in older children and adolescents are similar to what is seen in adults. The most common symptom is headache, which may be accompanied or followed by shortness of breath, dizziness, poor sleep, anorexia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;, section on 'Presentation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of AMS is based upon symptom severity and follows the same principles as in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76719\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76719 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2845239\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although rare in young children, high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) presents as increasing respiratory distress over one to two days, but may develop more precipitously. In some young children and infants, primary signs may not include tachypnea, but oxygen saturation will always be low relative to normal values at that altitude (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F98575\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98575 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13205892\" class=\"local\">'High altitude pulmonary edema'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of HAPE in older children and adolescents are similar to those in adults; tachypnea, rales, and cough productive of frothy, rusty sputum. Children with HAPE warrant immediate supplemental oxygen, descent or both. In emergency settings without the option of oxygen or descent, pharmacotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nifedipine</a> may be effective. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-pulmonary-edema#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"#H13206004\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acclimatization and slow ascent are the most effective ways to avoid AMS and HAPE in otherwise healthy children. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and pharmacologic prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13206044\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthy children generally tolerate travel to altitude well and rarely experience any serious HAI. The clinician should advise parents that resort communities generally have health care providers with expertise in altitude-related problems who are excellent sources for parents and children if they feel their child might be experiencing HAI. (See <a href=\"#H20743462\" class=\"local\">'Travel advice for parents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369415574\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Erin Endom, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Hackett PH, Luks AM, Lawley JS, Roach RC.
