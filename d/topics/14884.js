This product is licensed in Europe for this indication as well as for treatment Glanzmann's thrombasthenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Its apparent safety and utility in a variety of settings, most of which are not supported by clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>], has led to its use in a wide range of circumstances when other therapies have failed to achieve hemostasis. It is in these &quot;off-label&quot; settings that most practitioners will encounter the use of recombinant FVIIa.</p><p>In this review, we will present an appraisal of the potential benefits, risks, and costs of recombinant FVIIa. We recognize that few high-quality studies are available to guide its use in these areas. Recombinant FVIIa is often used off-label as a rescue therapy when transfusion and other approaches to hemostasis have failed. It is difficult, if not impossible, to obtain informed consent and conduct a randomized trial that reflects the use of a drug in this type of urgent situation. Therefore, the decision to use recombinant FVIIa will need to be made on the basis of less than perfect data.</p><p>The use of recombinant factor VIIa in people with hemophilia and inhibitors is discussed separately.

It is often not possible to neutralize high titer inhibitors even with administration of very high levels of replacement therapy. For this reason, it was a high priority in the 1970s and 80s to develop products that could &quot;bypass&quot; the need for the deficient factor and establish hemostasis in hemophiliacs with inhibitors. Such products are referred to as &quot;bypassing agents.&quot; In 1969 prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) were noted to improve hemostasis in a patient with hemophilia A with an inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. PCCs are mixtures of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors prepared from plasma, which were used at that time as a source of coagulation factor IX to treat patients with hemophilia B. Newer products containing increased levels of activated coagulation factors (activated prothrombin complex concentrates or aPCCs) were prepared in an attempt to increase the efficacy of bypassing therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. However, PCCs, and especially aPCCs, were associated with an increased risk of thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Several components in these products were considered as possible contributors to thrombogenicity: non-vitamin K-dependent zymogens, activated factors IX and X, and phospholipids from platelets resulting from inadequate centrifugation of the donor plasma. After numerous additional reports of thromboembolic complications, the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) Scientific and Standardization Committee Thrombogenicity Registry was established in 1988 in order to determine which component(s) of these products were responsible for hemostatic efficacy and to develop more defined products, which might be more effective and safer.</p><p>While the precise mechanism of action of PCCs as bypassing agents was unknown, it had been hypothesized that FVIIa in aPCCs contributed significantly to hemostatic efficacy. Purified plasma-derived FVIIa (at doses of 5 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> was first used in the late 1980s as a bypassing agent in hemophiliacs with inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. While there was the concern that giving an activated clotting factor might be thrombogenic, this agent proved to be hemostatically effective for surgery and joint bleeding, without thrombotic complications or evidence of systemic activation of coagulation.</p><p>Recombinant FVIIa (rFVIIa, NovoSeven), produced and developed as a commercial product by Novo Nordisk, was shown to be effective as a bypassing agent in hemophiliacs with inhibitors and in acquired hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. It appeared to require doses &gt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> for efficacy in most patients, with no evidence of systemic activation of coagulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22198968\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of rFVIIa mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-dose recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) was originally thought to act by increasing the activity of the extrinsic tissue factor (TF)-associated coagulation pathway, as occurs with physiologic levels of FVIIa at sites of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, when administered to supraphysiologic concentrations, rFVIIa binds to the surface of activated platelets in a TF-independent manner and promotes factor X (FX) activation and thrombin generation on the activated platelet surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Binding of FVIIa to platelets appears to involve the glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">Ib/IX/V</span> complex and anionic phospholipids expressed on activated platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, additional mechanisms may contribute to platelet binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In the hemophilias, platelet-bound rFVIIa partially restores platelet surface FX activation, which is deficient because of the absence of factor <span class=\"nowrap\">VIIIa/IXa</span> complexes. In non-hemophilic conditions, platelet-bound rFVIIa increases activation of both FIX and FX and increases thrombin generation above normal levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Increased thrombin generation then promotes increased activation and local accumulation of platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], including dysfunctional platelets, potentially improving hemostasis in a wide range of bleeding conditions.</p><p>Clinical observations and data from experimental models support this platelet-dependent and TF-independent mechanism for the hemostatic effect of rFVIIa. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The high concentrations of rFVIIa required for hemostatic efficacy in persons with hemophilia are far greater than would be required to saturate TF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In vitro, FVIIa was shown to bind to activated platelets in a TF-independent manner, and enhance platelet surface thrombin generation in the presence of plasma levels of coagulation factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelets from healthy volunteers and individuals with Glanzmann thrombasthenia were able to support fibrin generation via rFVIIa-mediated thrombin generation independent of TF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a mouse model of hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency), a form of FVIIa that was unable to bind to TF could control bleeding with equal efficacy as normal mouse FVIIa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>A potential role for TF-dependent activity in the hemostatic effect of rFVIIa has not been completely ruled out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. This is especially true in certain off-label uses. Because there is a very large amount of TF in the brain, FVIIa may indeed act by a TF-dependent mechanism when used to control intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Implications for clinical use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of action of rFVIIa has important implications for its clinical use(s):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since binding of rFVIIa to the platelet surface is a low-affinity interaction, it is not saturated at doses that are employed clinically. This means that increasing the dose (plasma concentration) of rFVIIa should increase the rate of platelet surface thrombin generation. Therefore, some practitioners have used doses of rFVIIa above the 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> recommended by the manufacturer and feel that this has resulted in increased hemostatic efficacy in patients with hemophilia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localization of rFVIIa activity to the activated platelet surface appears to explain the relative lack of thrombotic complications, since thrombin generation occurs on the appropriate surface (ie, activated platelets) and is subject to most of the normal control mechanisms that prevent inappropriate coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p>The proposed mechanism(s) of action for rFVIIa also suggests that the appropriate dose and effectiveness of rFVIIa may be quite different depending upon a number of other circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced levels of other coagulation factors and co-factors (eg, calcium, fibrinogen, prothrombin, factor X) as well as platelet number and function may limit the effectiveness of rFVIIa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in body temperature and pH may reduce the activity of factor VIIa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As examples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>rFVIIa activity decreased by approximately 90 percent and tissue factor (TF)-rFVIIa complex activity decreased by approximately 60 percent when pH changed from 7.4 to 7.0.

As an example, a retrospective analysis of data from the Premier Perspectives database, which contains discharge records from a sample of academic and nonacademic United States hospitals, has indicated that the use of rFVIIa increased more than 140-fold between 2000 and 2008, such that in 2008, 97 percent of 18,311 in-hospital uses were for off-label indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Accordingly, a registry has been developed to capture clinical experiences with the off-label use of this product in the management of severe bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of this off-label use was shown in a multi-institutional audit of 701 patients identified as having received rFVIIa; 92 percent were for &quot;off-label&quot; indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. While there is overwhelming evidence that rFVIIa has hemostatic effects in non-hemophilic patients, many questions remain as to the appropriate settings and guidelines for use, risks of thrombotic complications, appropriate monitoring, dosing, and integration with transfusion therapy. In addition, information on the efficacy and side effects of rFVIIa in such settings is largely anecdotal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/82-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22768015\"><span class=\"h3\">Meta-analyses of off-label uses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of meta-analyses and a Cochrane review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>] have been performed concerning the off-label uses of rFVIIa.</p><p>These issues were explored in a 2008 meta-analysis of 22 randomized controlled trials of rFVIIa in 3184 patients without hemophilia in which 15 percent died and 7.8 percent had thromboembolic events.

Since the above-noted meta-analysis included ALL randomized controlled trials of off-label FVIIa use, it combined patients with a wide range of disorders, from hematopoietic cell transplantation to trauma to hemorrhagic stroke. Thus, a significant effect on outcome in one clinical setting could have been diluted by a lack of benefit in another.</p><p>Similarly, an increased risk of thrombosis in one patient group (eg, hemorrhagic stroke in older patients with vascular disease) could have been hidden by the absence of increased risk in another group (eg, trauma in young previously healthy subjects). While this meta-analysis supports the overall contention that FVIIa can reduce bleeding in non-hemophilic patients, it cannot be viewed as high quality evidence for or against the efficacy or safety of FVIIa in any given patient group.</p><p>In addition to the absence of high quality data concerning the efficacy and safety of off-label use of FVIIa, such use also has reimbursement and medicolegal implications that need to be considered by the clinician. A major factor influencing the use of rFVIIa is its high cost. A single dose of 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> to a 70 kg person costs at least $4500 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>] and &pound;3700 in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. However, in some highly selected clinical conditions, judicious short-term use of the drug may be cost-effective. Because of the high cost of rFVIIa, many institutions have policies specifying the acceptable circumstances for its off-label use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-91</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">OFF-LABEL EXPERIENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In spite of the significant lack of data in many areas, rFVIIa is being used for a variety of off-label indications, including the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital/acquired FVII deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of rFVIIa for preventing or treating bleeding in a patient with Factor VII deficiency, an indication for which rFVIIa is approved in Europe, is discussed separately.

In addition to informed consent concerns in an acutely injured population, trauma patients are unavoidably a heterogeneous group.</p><p>Two linked randomized, multi-center controlled trials of the use of rFVIIa for this indication have been completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/77,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,121</a>]. One trial enrolled 143 bleeding patients with severe blunt trauma and the other enrolled 134 bleeding patients with penetrating trauma. Patients were enrolled after they had been transfused with six units of blood within four hours of admission. Patients assigned to receive rFVIIa received three doses of drug (200, 100 and 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span>. The first dose was given after the eighth unit of red cells and the two subsequent doses were one and three hours later. There was a statistically significant reduction in red blood cell transfusion and the need for massive (&gt;20 unit) transfusion in blunt trauma patients treated with rFVIIa. There was a similar trend in the penetrating trauma group. There were no differences in adverse events, such as thromboembolism or mortality, between the treatment groups in either study.</p><p>These studies have been criticized on several counts and interpreted as showing no benefit of rFVIIa, since there was no difference in overall mortality. However, this author believes these studies are more appropriately viewed as the first step in identifying patient groups that might benefit from rFVIIa. Furthermore, they demonstrated that trauma patients, who could be considered in a potentially prothrombotic state due to extensive tissue damage, can be given rFVIIa without excessive risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/122,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">122,123</a>]. Since the trauma patients were primarily young males, the same low risk of complications might not apply to older patients with preexisting risk factors for thrombosis (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Safety issues'</a> below).</p><p>The blunt trauma patients may have derived more benefit from rFVIIa because they were more likely to have coagulopathic bleeding responsive to rFVIIa, while the penetrating trauma patients were more likely to be bleeding from damage to large blood vessels, which is unlikely to be responsive to rFVIIa, unless also accompanied by coagulopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/122,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">122,124</a>].</p><p>The safety and cost-effectiveness of rFVIIa were evaluated in a retrospective study of coagulopathic patients with relatively isolated traumatic brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. Of the 179 patients, 62 percent were treated conventionally and 38 percent with rFVIIa. There were no differences in mortality or thromboembolic complications between the two groups, although for the subgroup of 110 patients requiring admission to the intensive care unit, hospital length of stay, days of mechanical ventilation, plasma utilization, and total costs were lower for rFVIIa treated patients. Other studies of the use of rFVIIa in patients with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage have reported results varying from beneficial to harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].</p><p>The main conclusions that can be drawn concerning the utility of rFVIIa in bleeding, coagulopathic trauma patients are that this agent shows significant potential and appears to be safe in young, previously healthy individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/127-129\" class=\"abstract_t\">127-129</a>]. The issue of which patients with severe trauma are most likely to benefit from treatment with rFVIIa was approached in a retrospective analysis of 380 injured patients who received this agent as an adjunct for hemorrhage control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. Logistic regression analysis indicated that systolic blood pressure &gt;90 mm Hg, platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL,</span> and a blood pH &ge;7.2 were associated with significantly improved survival for this group of patients.

A 2017 retrospective review of very low-birth-weight premature infants who developed life-threatening hemorrhage while in the neonatal intensive care unit found that one dose of rFVIIa (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> within 30 minutes of the onset of hemorrhage was effective in stopping pulmonary hemorrhage and reducing the need for blood products but did not decrease intraventricular hemorrhage rate and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. rFVIIa has also been successfully administered for pulmonary hemorrhage by intrapulmonary instillation in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/138,139\" class=\"abstract_t\">138,139</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24228136\"><span class=\"h2\">Off-label use in children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The off-label use of rFVIIa in children has also been expanding, despite the absence of adequate clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. In an analysis using the Pediatric Health Information System administrative database, of the 4942 admissions in which rFVIIa was used in children 18 years of age or younger between 2000 and 2007, 74 percent were for off-label uses. The mortality in the off-label group was 34 percent; thrombotic events occurred in 10.9 percent of the off-label admissions.</p><p>A separate analysis from the Haemostasis Registry Steering Committee reported on the off-label use of rFVIIa in 388 pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>].

There was a reduction in administration of blood products in the 24 hours after the first dose of FVIIa. Thromboembolic adverse events were reported in 5.4 percent, with no association between the thrombotic event and the size of the first dose. Overall 28-day mortality was 27 percent. On multivariate analysis, low pre-administration pH values and use in a non-surgical setting were both significantly associated with a worse outcome. While these registry data suggest that rFVIIa may be effective as a hemostatic agent in pediatric patients, they do not provide useful data on appropriate dosing, true complication rates, or expected outcomes.</p><p>A review of the off-label use of rFVIIa in pediatric cardiac surgery patients has concluded that there is no substantive evidence to support the efficacy of this agent as prophylactic or routine therapy during pediatric cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].

Since there is no laboratory test that correlates well with the clinical efficacy of rFVIIa, dosing must be determined empirically.</p><p>Dosing should be proportionate to the degree of hemostatic impairment and be given before hypothermia and acidosis impair effectiveness of the coagulation system. In a patient who is truly coagulopathic and the degree of impairment is severe, an initial dose of 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> would seem appropriate. However, few &quot;off-label&quot; uses will present the degree of impairment seen in hemophilia and a lower dose should be considered.</p><p>There are few data to guide the duration of therapy. We generally continue administration of rFVIIa until we are certain that bleeding has stopped. We generally do not give additional doses after bleeding has stopped, in order to minimize the potential risk of thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic events'</a> below.)</p><p>The use (especially off-label use) of rFVIIa could be made much more rational if a test could be devised and validated that would measure or predict the rFVIIa dose and circulating level needed for achieving effective hemostasis. Such a test would presumably include both the patient's platelets and plasma, since rFVIIa acts on the platelet surface and both coagulation factor levels and platelet attributes have been shown to affect the degree to which a given level of rFVIIa boosts thrombin generation on the platelet surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/19,143,144\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,143,144</a>].

Most of these complications have been associated with off-label use. This was shown in two studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of adverse events reported to the US FDA, in which there were 168 reports describing 185 thromboembolic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/147\" class=\"abstract_t\">147</a>], unlabeled indications accounted for 151 (90 percent) of the reports. Events included thromboembolic cerebrovascular accidents, acute myocardial infarction, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, venous thrombosis, including deep vein thrombosis, and clotted access devices. In 36 of the 50 reported deaths, the probable cause of death was the thromboembolic event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of data from 35 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of rFVIIa used on an off-label basis, there were 498 thromboembolic events among 4468 subjects (11.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/148\" class=\"abstract_t\">148</a>]. While rates of venous thromboembolic events were similar (5.3 percent for rFVIIa and 5.7 percent for placebo), rates of arterial thromboembolic events were significantly higher in those receiving rFVIIa (5.5 versus 3.2 percent). Rates of arterial events were especially high among subjects 75 years of age or older (10.8 percent) as compared with those &lt;75 years of age (4.1 percent).</p><p/><p>A multicenter assessment of the off-label use of rFVIIa in 315 subjects found that 9.8 percent of patients suffered an adverse event within 24 hours of rFVIIa administration, most of which were thrombotic in nature and none of which was fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Thrombosis was associated with a higher cumulative dose of rFVIIa. A significant proportion of patients who received rFVIIa for off-label indications (21 percent) had risk factors for thrombosis before rFVIIa administration including: recent or active thromboembolic events, disseminated intravascular coagulation, heart failure, diabetes, smoking, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome, hyperlipidemia, history of coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or Budd-Chiari syndrome. Thus, patients who receive rFVIIa for off-label indications have very different hemostatic and vascular characteristics that put them at greater risk for thrombosis than the hemophilics for whom we have extensive safety data.</p><p>In a review of 13 clinical trials using rFVIIa for coagulopathy secondary to treatment with anticoagulants, cirrhosis, or severe traumatic injury, adverse thrombotic events were noted in 5.3 percent of those treated with placebo and 6.0 percent of those receiving rFVIIa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>].</p><p>There is one group of patients who are much more homogeneous from which we can draw some limited conclusions about the thrombotic risk of rFVIIa administration. These are patients who received rFVIIa for treatment of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). While these patients had some degree of underlying vascular disease, they likely had normal hemostatic function or even a procoagulant state at the time of rFVIIa administration. In the initial clinical trial, 399 patients with spontaneous ICH who could be evaluated within three hours of onset were assigned to received placebo, 40, 80 or 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> of rFVIIa; patients with a recent history of thromboembolic or vaso-occlusive disease were excluded from the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recombinant-factor-viia-clinical-uses-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>].</p><p>In this trial, the risk of arterial thrombosis appeared to show a dose dependence.
