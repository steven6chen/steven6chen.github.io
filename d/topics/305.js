However, as the birth rate for women older than 40 years has increased in recent years in some countries such as the United States, MI in pregnant women may become more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Issues related to acute MI in pregnancy will be reviewed here. Other types of acquired heart disease in pregnancy, such as valvular disease and heart failure, are discussed separately.

It was estimated the risk of MI was increased three- to fourfold compared to nonpregnant women. Possible explanations for the increased rate of MI compared to the study above include regional differences and improved detection due to widespread use of troponin testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Most cases occur in the third trimester and six-week postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for acute myocardial infarction (MI) in pregnant women are similar to those in the general population, but on a population basis, are present less frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age (age &gt;35 years)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyslipidemia</p><p/><p>The magnitude of the increase in risk was evaluated in the series of 859 cases from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a multivariable regression model, the odds ratio was 21.7 for hypertension, 8.4 for smoking, and 3.6 for diabetes. Age &ge;30 years was also an independent risk factor and the odds ratio was 6.7 between the ages of 30 and 34, and 15 to 16 at &ge;35 years of age. Other independent risk factors in this report were thrombophilia, including a history of thrombosis and antiphospholipid syndrome (odds ratio 25.6), and pregnancy complications such as blood transfusion and postpartum infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>It is not clear if pregnancy itself is a risk factor for MI. In a report with 3.6 million woman-years of observation, the incidence of a first-ever MI not related to pregnancy was 5 per 100,000 woman-years in women of child-bearing age, with the risk increasing dramatically after age 35 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Since pregnancy lasts three-quarters of a year, this rate of MI is not different from the rates in the two large epidemiologic studies cited above (2.8 to 6.2 per 100,000 pregnancies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Other risk factors that have been identified include preeclampsia, thrombophilia, transfusion, postpartum infections, cocaine use, and multiparity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155062428\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two studies of over 100 pregnant women have evaluated the causes of myocardial infarction using findings at the time of coronary angiography or autopsy and found atherosclerosis to be the direct cause less often than in the general population (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes#H13452767\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of the vulnerable plaque in acute coronary syndromes&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes#H13452783\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of the vulnerable plaque in acute coronary syndromes&quot;, section on 'Plaque features responsible for acute thrombosis'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 103 cases (1995 to 2005), coronary atherosclerosis (with or without) intracoronary thrombus was present in only 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The remaining cases consisted of coronary artery dissection (27 percent), thrombus in a normal coronary artery (8 percent), coronary artery spasm (2 percent), emboli (2 percent), and normal coronary arteries (13 percent).

It has been suggested that arterial dissection during or early after pregnancy is related to structural changes in the intima and media of the arterial wall that are produced by hormonal and hemodynamic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].

In brief, patients often complain of the development (over the course of minutes) of chest discomfort that is felt in the anterior chest or epigastric area and often with radiation to the shoulders, arms, jaws, or back. Shortness of breath and nausea may also be present.

The following are a few comments regarding common interventions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> &ndash; Low dose aspirin (75 to 162 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> appears to be safe in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>P2Y</strong><strong><sub>12</sub></strong><strong> receptor blocker</strong> &ndash; All patients with recent acute coronary syndrome are treated with a platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a>). The safety of these has not been established. The pregnancy category (United States Food and Drug Administration) for these three are B, B, and C, respectively.<br/><br/>In addition, the combination of a P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> might increase bleeding at the time of delivery. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, we and others recommend holding clopidogrel for seven days before a scheduled delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fibrinolytic therapy</strong> &ndash; There are no controlled studies examining the efficacy and safety of fibrinolytic therapy for acute ST-elevation MI in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Its use is considered relatively contraindicated. Although teratogenicity has not been reported, the reported risk of maternal hemorrhage is about 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The risk of puerperal hemorrhage appears to be confined to women treated within eight hours of delivery, although some women have been safely treated, most with disorders other than acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-myocardial-infarction-and-pregnancy/abstract/20,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22-24</a>].

For women who are anticoagulated with heparin for days, weeks, or even months, pregnancy complications associated with bleeding (eg, threatened miscarriage, placenta previa, abruptio placenta) and delivery are more problematic. In such patients, antepartum heparin may have to be discontinued until the bleeding has resolved. In addition, heparin should be discontinued before or during labor to minimize maternal bleeding complications and allow neuraxial anesthesia.

For the rare cases of a pregnant woman with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) who presents with acute MI, the optimal anticoagulant strategy is not known. While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bivalirudin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bivalirudin</a> is often preferred to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> in non-pregnant individuals with HIT who sustain acute MI, these agents are generally avoided during pregnancy.
