As a result, the clinical manifestations of NTM lung disease are often similar to those of the underlying disease. These include cough, fatigue, malaise, fever, weight loss, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chest discomfort. These same symptoms are also present in patients with NTM lung disease who do not have preexisting pulmonary disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in HIV-negative patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The possible presence of NTM lung disease often arises clinically when NTM are identified on sputum culture from a patient under evaluation for tuberculosis. The laboratory findings used to confirm the diagnosis of NTM infection in this setting will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of NTM are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex lung infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEST IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The radiographic findings of nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease are variable, depending in part upon the species. Findings consistent with NTM pulmonary infection on chest radiograph or high-resolution computed tomography scan include infiltrates (usually nodular or reticulonodular), cavities, multifocal bronchiectasis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiple small nodules. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in HIV-negative patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The radiographic pattern of disease can usually be separated into predominantly cavitary versus <span class=\"nowrap\">nodular/bronchiectatic</span>. Some generalizations can be made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cavitary disease in the upper lung zones, similar to pulmonary tuberculosis, is seen in approximately 90 percent of patients with M. kansasii infection and perhaps 50 percent of those with Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. The cavities caused by these organisms tend to have thinner walls and less surrounding parenchymal opacity than those caused by M. tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-of-the-lungs-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least 50 percent of patients with MAC lung disease have radiographic abnormalities characterized by nodules associated with bronchiectasis or <span class=\"nowrap\">nodular/bronchiectatic</span> disease. The nodules and bronchiectasis are usually present within the same lobe and occur most frequently in the right middle lobe and lingula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-of-the-lungs-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>One study, for example, evaluated 100 patients with bronchiectasis, 24 of who also had multiple pulmonary nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-of-the-lungs-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among the patients in whom sputum cultures were obtained, a positive culture for MAC was much more likely in those with pulmonary nodules than in those without pulmonary nodules (53 versus 4 percent).</p><p>High-resolution CT scans of the chest are especially helpful for diagnosing this pattern of MAC lung disease as bronchiectasis and small nodules may not be easily discernible on plain chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-of-the-lungs-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">nodular/bronchiectatic</span> radiographic pattern can also be seen with other NTM pathogens including M. abscessus, M. simiae, and M. kansasii.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solitary nodules and dense consolidation have also been described.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural effusions are uncommon, but reactive pleural thickening is frequently seen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Species-specific skin test antigens may show considerable cross reactivity and are not commercially available or approved for diagnostic purposes. However, epidemiologic and laboratory studies with well-characterized antigens have shown that dual skin testing with TB versus NTM-derived tuberculins can discriminate between prior NTM and prior TB disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-of-the-lungs-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SERODIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been investigation into the utility of serodiagnostic techniques for detecting MAC lung infection and distinguishing it from tuberculosis. In one study, an enzyme immunoassay that measured serum IgA antibody to glycopeptidolipid core antigen specific for MAC was useful for differentiating MAC lung disease from tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-of-the-lungs-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Further studies are needed to validate this technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the lack of diagnostic specificity of chest radiography and skin testing, the diagnosis of NTM lung disease requires microbiologic confirmation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61404 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The possible presence of NTM infection should be considered in a patient with a chronic pulmonary infiltrate with or without a cavity and persistence of one of the aforementioned symptoms. The diagnostic evaluation should consist of smear and culture of at least three separate expectorated sputum specimens obtained in the morning. If the etiology of the patient's symptoms remains uncertain and the infiltrate persists, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and or transbronchial biopsies should be performed.</p><p>Sputum sent for culture of NTM must be chemically decontaminated first in order to eliminate common bacteria and fungi that would overwhelm the culture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology of nontuberculous mycobacteria&quot;, section on 'Culture'</a>.)</p><p>Positive sputum cultures for NTM must be interpreted cautiously since these organisms have variable virulence and can be recovered from the respiratory tract without causing progressive infection (transient infection). In addition, NTM are common in the natural environment and may contaminate laboratory specimens. Tap water especially (liquid or frozen) may contain NTM and contaminate clinical and laboratory specimens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>NTM frequently occurs in the context of underlying lung disease, which can also cause symptoms. As a result, the distinction between transient infection or contamination and true infection is sometimes difficult. Fortunately, most lung disease caused by NTM is indolent so that careful assessment over time is possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an attempt to address these difficulties, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) have jointly established specific criteria for the diagnosis of NTM lung disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61404\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61404 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-of-the-lungs-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In symptomatic patients with evidence of pulmonary disease by imaging studies and with other processes such as fungal disease, malignancy, and tuberculosis excluded, the diagnostic criteria to support NTM clinical infection as opposed to colonization of secretions includes one of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-of-the-lungs-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive culture results from at least two separate expectorated sputum samples (regardless of AFB smear result)</p><p/><p>OR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive culture result from at least one bronchial wash or lavage (regardless of AFB smear result)</p><p/><p>OR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transbronchial or other lung biopsy with mycobacterial histopathologic features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) and positive culture for NTM</p><p/><p>OR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy showing mycobacterial histopathologic features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) and one or more sputum or bronchial washings that are culture positive for NTM</p><p/><p>OR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A positive culture from pleural fluid or any other normally sterile extrapulmonary site.</p><p/><p>Isolation of M. gordonae, M. mucogenicum, M. nonchromogenicum, M. haemophilum, M. flavescens, M. gastri, M. terrae, or M. triviale indicates probable colonization or contamination. These organisms are generally not pathogenic for humans except in the context of severe cellular immunodeficiency, such as AIDS. Expert consultation should be obtained when NTM are recovered that are either infrequently encountered or that usually represent environmental contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-of-the-lungs-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Making a diagnosis of NTM infection may not necessitate the initiation of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex lung infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Isolation of NTM in symptomatic patients, regardless of whether the above <span class=\"nowrap\">ATS/IDSA</span> criteria are met, may itself be a marker for poor prognosis. In a retrospective review of patients with at least one positive culture for NTM (predominantly from pulmonary specimens), four-year mortality rates were high and not significantly different among the 61 patients who met and the 59 patients who did not meet <span class=\"nowrap\">ATS/IDSA</span> criteria for NTM infection (28 versus 41 percent mortality); a similar percentage of the patients who were treated for NTM did and did not meet criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-of-the-lungs-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Prognosis was most related to the severity of underlying diseases, which was greater among patients who did not meet criteria. However, determining the prognostic impact of the current diagnostic guidelines is complicated, and the diagnostic criteria remain useful for determining which patients are likely to have significant NTM lung disease and should be considered candidates for therapy. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87182791\"><span class=\"h1\">NUCLEIC ACID PROBES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Highly accurate nucleic acid probes (Accuprobe, GenProbe, Inc) are commercially available that can identify Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) isolates within one day after recognizable growth is evident, a technique currently used by most reference laboratories.
