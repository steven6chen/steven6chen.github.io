We suggest using whole body (18)F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose labelled positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(FDG-PET)/computed</span> tomography (CT) to determine the preferred biopsy site. If possible, the site of greatest FDG avidity should be biopsied. While an increased standardized uptake value (SUV) on FDG-PET is suggestive of RT, histologic confirmation is necessary.

Of the 95 patients with RT, the median SUV was 17.6 and 88 percent had an SUV &gt;5. Patients without RT on biopsy were subclassified as having histologically indolent or histologically aggressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), with 34 and 72 percent having SUV &gt;5, respectively.

The type 1 category is characterized by scattered or clustered Reed-Sternberg cells in a background of CLL cells.

Although DLBCL arising by transformation of other low-grade lymphomas is almost always clonally related, initial reports of RT found that DLBCL arises by clear clonal evolution from underlying <span class=\"nowrap\">CLL/SLL</span> only about 60 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Some of the cases in this initial study were of ambiguous origin, however, and more recent studies have suggested that the DLBCL and CLL more commonly have clonal origins, as much as 90 to 100 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/3,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,37</a>].

Disruption of TP53 was more common in DLBCL that was clonally related to CLL (60 versus 23 percent) while c-MYC aberration was equally common in cases clonally related or clonally unrelated to CLL (approximately 30 percent each).

Five of six cases of CLL associated with Hodgkin variant RT were found to have mutated IgVH genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>However, some evidence suggests that cases of RT acquire the capacity for somatic hypermutation similar to many cases of DLBCL. RT cases showed higher levels of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and hypermutation of c-MYC, PAX-5 and RhoH, which were not seen in their predecessor CLLs or CLLs that did not transform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/46,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48</a>]. Microsatellite instability (MSI) has also been identified in four of nine cases of RT as compared with none of 10 cases of CLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. No evidence of mutation of hMLH1 or hMSH2 has been found, but the hMLH1 promoter was found to be hypermethylated in those cases with MSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Mutations of individual tumor-suppressor and cell cycle regulatory genes have also been reported to be associated with RT. TP53 mutations are common, detected in three of seven RT tumors as compared with 6 of 40 CLLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Mutations of <span class=\"nowrap\">INK4a/ARF,</span> a possible upstream regulator of p53 activity, have been found in 29 percent of RT cases as compared with 4 percent of CLLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] and are often present when p53 mutation is absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Together these mutations are present in about 60 percent of RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/1,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,44</a>].</p><p>The cell cycle inhibitor p21 has also been found to be overexpressed in three of seven RTs as compared with 3 of 15 CLLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]; although most CLLs had strong p27 reactivity and no expression of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, the RT tumors had no p27 expression and high expression of Rb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. These data suggest that dysregulation of the cell cycle in RT may have a different pattern than that seen in CLL, but whether or not these mutations are truly causative remains unclear.</p><p>The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) has been intermittently implicated in the pathogenesis of RT. The largest pathologic study from the Mayo Clinic found that 4 of 25 (16 percent) patients with DLBCL RT had evidence of EBV in the DLBCL by latent membrane protein (LMP) expression or EBV DNA or RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Although the pathogenic role of the virus is unclear, evidence for its involvement is probably greatest in the Hodgkin lymphoma variant of RT, in which EBV can be found in the RS cells in a majority of the limited reported cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT AND PROGNOSTIC FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, Richter's transformation (RT) has been associated with a dismal prognosis, with median survivals of five to eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/richters-transformation-in-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-small-lymphocytic-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Patients with clonally unrelated diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) had a significantly longer median survival (63 versus 14 months) that resembled that of de novo DLBCL. These results suggest a subset of patients with clonally unrelated DLBCL may be cured of their DLBCL.

In patients with clonally related RT, complete remissions after chemotherapy are short-lived, and treatment with chemotherapy alone is palliative. Long-term survivors have been reported following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); as such, we offer nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT to most eligible patients in remission, although the number of patients eligible for allogeneic HCT who also attain a stable remission is small.
