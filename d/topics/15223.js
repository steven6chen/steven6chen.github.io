We recommend risk stratification, using validated risk prediction tools, of all patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACS), particularly those with ST-depression on the electrocardiogram or elevated cardiac biomarkers. We and others prefer the GRACE or TIMI tools, as they are derived from large populations and have been well validated in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-stratification-after-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>However, most of these individuals undergo early angiography in the absence of a contraindication in our hospitals.

For example, for lower-risk patients with chest pain, but no ST-segment deviation on the first electrocardiogram, and normal troponin levels, the risk of death or myocardial infarction may be as low as 6.7 percent at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-stratification-after-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The following are validated risk prediction models or tools that can be used early into the care of patients hospitalized with NSTEACS.

The score provides prognosis at six months, one year, and three years and was developed in over 30,000 patients with ACS and validated externally in a registry of nearly 3000 patients. Significant nonlinear associations were found for age, systolic blood pressure, pulse, and creatinine.

However, early measurements may be misleading, since improvement in LVEF, beginning within three days and largely complete by 14 days, is common in patients who either reperfuse spontaneously or undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a presumed reflection, at least in part, of recovery from myocardial stunning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-stratification-after-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In general, echocardiography should be used for routine assessment of LVEF after an NSTEACS. Among patients who have had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), it has the added advantage of detecting other factors that can be associated with a worse prognosis such as diastolic dysfunction, concurrent right ventricular dysfunction, increased left atrial volume, mitral regurgitation, and a high wall motion score index, which reflects a more severe impairment in overall left ventricular systolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-stratification-after-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>].
