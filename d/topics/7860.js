In the 1930s and 40s, cases were described resulting from abortion, genitourinary manipulation, and spinal anesthesia. In the following two decades, gram-negative bacillary meningitis was recognized as an occasional complication of injuries and neurosurgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Subsequently, gram-negative bacillary meningitis has become an important cause of hospital-associated central nervous system (CNS) infection in adults, usually due to neurosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The likelihood of post-neurosurgery meningitis being due to gram-negative organisms is increased when antimicrobial prophylaxis, which predominantly provides gram-positive coverage, is given to prevent surgical site infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The major responsible organisms in this series were coagulase-negative staphylococci (53 percent), <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (13 percent), and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> (8 percent). Rates of meningitis following transsphenoidal surgery range from 0.4 to 2 percent, usually due to CSF leakage from a dural tear complicating the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Such fistulae sometimes produce visible leakage of CSF through the nose or ear but may also be clinically inapparent. Subsequent CSF leakage through these fistulae may be continuous, intermittent, occult or overt. Post-traumatic meningitis associated with a dural fistula can occur within days, weeks, months, or rarely even years after head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The vast majority of such infections do not involve the meninges and are due to skin flora or <em>S. aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, gram-negative bacilli can also cause these infections. In two large surveys of the outcome of epidural catheters and tunneled intraspinal catheters, 14 infected patients were identified, only three of whom had meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Gram-negative bacilli (in both cases <em>P. aeruginosa</em>) were responsible for two of these 14 infections.

Thus, lumbar puncture performed to exclude nosocomial meningitis as the cause of mental status changes in a hospitalized patient without the preceding conditions has a low yield and rarely changes management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The rarity of nosocomial meningitis was documented in a study done in a university hospital in Turkey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Nearly three quarters of patients with gram-negative meningitis have CSF to blood glucose concentration ratios less than 0.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It appears that the mean CSF glucose is lower in cases of spontaneous gram-negative bacillary meningitis than in those cases that follow neurosurgical procedures, despite similar CSF protein and leukocyte counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The reasons for this observation remain obscure. It is important to note that CSF to serum glucose ratios of less than 50 percent are infrequent after uncomplicated neurosurgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell count &mdash; Patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis typically have elevated leukocyte counts.

In one series, CSF white cell counts ranged from 3,174 to 12,495 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm3</span> depending upon which species of gram-negative bacillus was isolated, and 57 to 80 percent of these cells consisted of PMNs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one pediatric case series, 6 percent of patients with gram-negative bacillary meningitis had normal CSF leukocyte counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Possible explanations for this infrequent and sometimes misleading finding include early timing of the lumbar puncture (LP) prior to the development of inflammation, failure of fluid obtained from the lumbar space to mirror the inflammatory changes present in ventricular fluid, or inability of young infants to mount an inflammatory response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gram stain &mdash; The Gram stain of CSF is a crucial component of the diagnostic process. This test can be performed rapidly and may be a crucially important early clue to the diagnosis and appropriate early therapy. The Gram stain is positive for gram-negative bacilli in more than 50 percent of adult patients with a positive culture result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

However it is important to emphasize that false negative and false positive Gram stain results occasionally occur, and the properties and morphology of organisms seen on CSF Gram stain can be misinterpreted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, a negative or positive Gram stain should not be the sole basis for starting empiric therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Culture &mdash; CSF culture is essential to establish the etiology of meningitis and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymerase chain reaction &mdash; Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA can be performed on CSF for the diagnosis of meningitis. This method has shown a sensitivity of 86 percent and a specificity of 97 percent compared with culture. Importantly, this may be the diagnostic method of choice when antimicrobial therapy has already started or when cultures remain negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, this technology is not available in most hospital laboratories and careful quality control measures are mandatory to prevent false positive results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactate &mdash; Measurement of the CSF lactate concentration is a rapid and inexpensive ancillary test, that occasionally may help support an early diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Because lactate levels are not affected by the presence of red blood cells in the CSF, lactate testing can sometimes be helpful when the CSF is bloody or when routine tests give inconclusive results. In one study of CSF lactate levels in the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis following neurosurgery, lactate levels had a higher sensitivity and specificity compared with the CSF to blood glucose ratios (88 versus 77 percent and 98 versus 87 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

There have also been inconsistencies in the reported diagnostic power of the test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1788105599\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood cultures are also important for the isolation of a pathogen in patients with meningitis.

Despite the increasing use of complex neurosurgical techniques, nosocomial gram-negative bacillary meningitis remains a relatively uncommon infection. Spontaneous nontraumatic gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adults is rare, most frequently occurs in patients who are elderly or have other comorbidities, and is associated with urinary tract instrumentation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gram-negative bacilli can seed the cerebrospinal fluid secondary to bacteremia, trauma, and surgery. Subsequent meningitis can develop as a result of bacterial multiplication and induction of inflammation in the subarachnoid and ventricular space, followed by progression of inflammation and development of neuronal damage. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> account for the majority of cases of gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adults. Other important, less frequent pathogens include <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Acinetobacter</em>, <em>Enterobacter</em>, and <em>Serratia</em>. <em>E. coli</em> is the most common cause of gram-negative meningitis in infants. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of meningitis, such as fever, altered mental status, seizures, and nuchal rigidity, are often dramatic in cases of spontaneous gram-negative bacillary meningitis, but may be insidious in onset or obscured by corticosteroid therapy in nosocomial cases. Confusional state may be the only presenting feature in elderly patients with underlying medical illness. Fever is usually present in this group, but headache and meningeal signs may be absent. In infants, fever, irritability, seizures, lethargy, poor feeding, and a bulging fontanelle are often clinical clues of meningitis. Gram-negative bacillary meningitis is commonly accompanied by bacteremia. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality due to gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adults and children has ranged from 40 to 80 percent. Important negative prognostic factors include an altered state of consciousness at presentation (unresponsive or responsive to pain only), failure of timely administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and the presence of septic shock. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Outcome of infection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications are similar to those of meningitis of any bacterial etiology and include ventriculitis, brain or metastatic abscesses, seizures, and hearing, cognitive, or motor deficits. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Complications of meningitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with meningitis in general, the diagnosis of gram-negative bacillary meningitis predominantly relies upon examination of the CSF for protein, glucose, cell count determinations, Gram stain, and culture. (See <a href=\"#H1788105593\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrospinal fluid analysis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;, section on 'CSF analysis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Gram stain is positive for gram-negative bacilli in more than 50 percent of adult patients with a positive culture result. CSF culture is essential to establish the etiology of meningitis and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibilities of the pathogen. (See <a href=\"#H1788105593\" class=\"local\">'Cerebrospinal fluid analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for performing computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the head prior to lumbar puncture are similar to those for patients with suspected acute bacterial meningitis in general. However, patients who have undergone prior neurosurgical procedures should undergo CT scan prior to lumbar puncture. (See <a href=\"#H1788105605\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomographic scanning'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications for CT scan before LP'</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gram-negative-bacillary-meningitis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Theccanat G, Hirschfield L, Isenberg H.
