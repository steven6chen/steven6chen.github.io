It is caused by a virus called varicella-zoster virus. This virus can linger in your body for years and later cause a painful rash called &quot;shingles.&quot;</p><p>Chickenpox used to be much more common than it is now. Today there is a vaccine (a shot) that helps keep people from getting infected. The vaccine is called the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">varicella vaccine</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394844295\"><span class=\"h1\">Who should get the varicella vaccine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all children should get a shot of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">varicella vaccine</a> when they are 12 to 15 months old. Then they should get a second shot when they are 4 to 6 years old. Everyone needs 2 separate shots for the vaccine to work best. Rarely, people who get the vaccine might still get mild chickenpox. But this is more likely to happen if the person did not get the second shot.</p><p>Most adults who have never had chickenpox should also get the vaccine, especially if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Work in healthcare or with small children</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are in close contact with people who have trouble fighting infections, such as people with cancer or HIV</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Live or work in a college, prison, or other place where a lot of people live close together</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travel outside the US and Canada</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are women younger than 45</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394844302\"><span class=\"h1\">Who should not get the varicella vaccine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors do <strong>not</strong> recommend the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">varicella vaccine</a> for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain people who have trouble fighting infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant soon</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and adults who have had chickenpox</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most people in the United States who were born before 1980 (people born before 1980 usually have had chickenpox, even if they don't remember it)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394844309\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the most common side effects of the varicella vaccine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effect is pain where the shot was given.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394844316\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of chickenpox?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When you first get chickenpox, you usually:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get a fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel sick</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get a sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not feel like eating</p><p/><p>About a day after these symptoms start, the chickenpox rash shows up. It starts out as groups of small, usually itchy, red bumps. These bumps usually swell with fluid and then pop. After that, the rash dries up and forms a scab. The rash lasts about a week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394844323\"><span class=\"h1\">How does chickenpox spread?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have not had chickenpox or the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">varicella vaccine</a>, you can catch chickenpox just by being around someone who is infected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394844330\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I go to the doctor or nurse if I think my child or I have chickenpox?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Do not go to the doctor or nurse without calling first. Your doctor or nurse might be able to tell you what to do over the phone. That way you will not risk infecting other people at the doctor's office.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394844337\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child or I need treatment for chickenpox?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might need treatment, but your child might not. Most healthy young children get over chickenpox on their own without any problems. On the other hand, older children who have not had the vaccine and adults with chickenpox can sometimes have problems. For them, doctors and nurses recommend a medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">valacyclovir</a> (brand name: Valtrex) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acyclovir</a> (brand name: Zovirax). It helps people feel better faster.</p><p>There are also non-prescription medicines you or your child can take to help with symptoms, such as fever and itching. But you should <strong>never</strong> give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to a child who is younger than 18 years old. In children, aspirin can cause a dangerous condition called Reye syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394844344\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if I was near someone with chickenpox?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have not had chickenpox or the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-virus-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">varicella vaccine</a>, call your doctor right away. It might still be possible to avoid getting sick! The varicella vaccine can work even if someone has already been near the virus. For people who cannot have the vaccine, there are other options that can help keep them from getting sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394844351\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant and think I might be getting chickenpox?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse right away! Also, if you have never had chickenpox, call your doctor or nurse if you were near someone with chickenpox or shingles. (Shingles is a painful rash related to the chickenpox virus.)</p><p>Getting chickenpox while you are pregnant can cause problems for you and your baby. But there is a medicine that can help &ndash; if you get it soon enough.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394844428\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shingles-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shingles (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chickenpox-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chickenpox prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shingles-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Shingles (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
