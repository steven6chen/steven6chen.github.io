The first category comprises older patients whose typical symptoms of asthma developed in childhood or early adulthood and persisted through later life. Normal lung function is usually interspersed with intermittent periods of airflow obstruction, although chronic airway remodeling may lead to airflow limitation that does not fully reverse. The second category, which is less common, comprises patients who first develop new symptoms of asthma as older adults. The diagnosis in the first category is usually reasonably clear. The diagnosis in the second category may be challenging due to the higher incidence of COPD and the longer list of differential diagnoses. We find these two categories helpful for the discussion of the disease, but acknowledge their limitations. The clinical course may be more complex; for example, childhood asthma usually remits in adolescence, but often reappears later in adulthood. Evidence is lacking for the definition of these categories and for treatment strategies based upon these categories.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of asthma in older adults will be reviewed here. General topics on the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of asthma and COPD are discussed separately.

In a study of the respiratory effects of air pollution in older adults, daily hospital admissions for asthma were highly associated with increases in NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> in the cool seasons and increases in black smoke year around [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Ozone levels may also contribute to the development of asthma in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comorbid conditions</strong> &ndash; Recognized and unrecognized comorbid conditions are common in older patients with asthma. These contribute to increased asthma morbidity because they may cause reduced adherence to asthma medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In an analysis of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), among older patients with asthma, 20 percent had heart failure, 20 percent had a history of myocardial infarction, and 45 percent had hypertension, leaving aside overlap with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Obesity has been suggested as a risk factor for asthma in older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].

Medications used to treat hypertension, coronary heart disease, glaucoma, and arthritis, include agents that can exacerbate underlying asthma (eg, topical or systemic beta blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, or NSAIDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Discontinuing the medication may lead to improved asthma control. While the incidence of adult-onset asthma typically decreases with menopause, it is increased two-fold among women taking postmenopausal hormones (estrogen only and estrogen plus progestin) compared to women not taking postmenopausal hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The asthma symptoms of intermittent wheeze, cough, and chest tightness are no different in older persons than in younger persons, but older individuals are less likely to report dyspnea related to airflow limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Older patients may have moderate to severe airflow limitation yet may not complain of dyspnea occurring with reported attacks of wheezing, chest tightness, or cough. This may be the result of adaptation to the long-term presence of symptoms or reflect the &quot;paradox of well-being.&quot; The latter refers to high levels of life satisfaction in older persons and can also include lower health expectations (increasing the likelihood that symptoms are not identified as a concern, or are minimized in severity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Clues to the presence of asthma include symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and ocular itching that may indicate allergic disease and nasal congestion and anosmia in the absence of itch and sneeze that may suggest nasal polyposis. Chronic cough is another important clue to asthma in nonsmoking older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>Older patients with asthma seen in the outpatient setting usually have a normal physical exam of the chest, thus, a lack of expiratory wheezing, prolonged expiratory time, or hyperinflation of the chest wall does not rule-out asthma in a patient with a history of asthma-like symptoms. On the other hand, pale edematous nasal mucosa or the presence of nasal polyps increase the likelihood of asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450267318\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of older adults with suspected asthma is focused on pulmonary function testing. A chest radiograph is almost always included in the evaluation of new onset asthma in older adults. Laboratory studies, such as skin or serologic tests for allergy, are useful in selected patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98321275\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This section focuses on the use of pulmonary function testing in older adults; PFT is discussed in more detail separately.

Spirometry is easy and reliable when performed with office spirometers that comply with the National Lung Health Education Program (NLHEP) recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. These spirometers allow patients to stop each exhalation maneuver after only six seconds (FEV<sub>6</sub>), incorporate extensive maneuver quality checks, and provide the best reference equations for older people (NHANES III) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;, section on 'Equipment'</a>.)</p><p>Airflow limitation is traditionally defined as a ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">)/forced</span> vital capacity (FVC) &lt;0.7. Some authors argue that airflow limitation should be defined as an FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio below the fifth percentile lower limit of the normal range (LLN), as the FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio declines with age and a large portion of asymptomatic older adults who have never smoked have an FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio that is less than the fixed value 0.7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. When making the diagnosis of asthma in older adults, either criterion is acceptable, remembering that normal spirometry does not exclude and is quite consistent with the diagnosis of asthma. On the other hand, a definition of COPD based on a post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio &lt;0.7 is advocated in some guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Once the presence of airflow limitation has been identified by a reduced FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio, the FEV<sub>1</sub> percent predicted is used to determine the severity of airflow limitation. In the USA, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III reference equations are recommended for interpretation of spirometry results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;, section on 'Interpretation'</a>.) </p><p>Airflow limitation may be caused by asthma, COPD, bronchiolitis obliterans, and central airway obstruction, thus further assessment is needed to confirm that the patient has asthma. Furthermore, the absence of airflow limitation does not rule out asthma, especially if the patient is not symptomatic at the time of testing, since airflow limitation in asthma is intermittent, by definition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary function testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Bronchodilator response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is helpful to assess bronchodilator reversibility in adult patients with airflow limitation on spirometry, as recommended by the NAEPP guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In patients with asthma, older age does not alter the acute response to inhaled bronchodilator (BD) drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. Patients must omit inhaled bronchodilators prior to testing, usually for a minimum of 12 hours. The average time to peak effect of a short-acting beta-agonist such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> is approximately 10 minutes, which is similar in both young and older patients with asthma. The combination of albuterol and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a> bromide (eg, Combivent) for diagnostic testing will often produce more effective bronchodilation in older adults, but the peak effect takes 30 minutes to occur and the results are less specific for asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. In either case, the probability of asthma is increased if the post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> increases more than 200 mL and the increase is greater than 12 percent. If the post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ratio improve from obstruction into the normal range, then the probability of asthma is increased and COPD is ruled out. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults#H281210450\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;, section on 'Post-bronchodilator'</a>.)</p><p>Some spirometers report the change in the forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75 percent of FVC (also known as the mid-maximal flow rate or FEF25-75) following inhaled bronchodilator. However, this parameter should not be used to determine a bronchodilator response, as abnormalities in these mid-range flow measurements are not specific for small airways disease and may be misleading [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Bronchoprovocation testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoprovocation testing, such as a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> challenge test (MCT), can be helpful in the differential diagnosis of dyspnea and cough in older patients with normal spirometry, who are not taking asthma medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/50,66,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,66,68</a>]. With normal baseline spirometry, side effects from MCTs are rare, even in older persons. </p><p>A low provocative challenge dose (PC-20) from the MCT (&lt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> increases the probability of asthma in patients with asthma-like symptoms.

Therefore, a PC-20 threshold of &lt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> to define BHR in older patients may be more appropriate than the traditional &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span>.

However, the compliance and quality of home measurements of lung function in older persons is often suboptimal. Morning dips of 30 percent or more in PEF or FEV<sub>1</sub> are abnormal in older people, and may help to diagnose asthma in a few patients, but high PEF lability predicts asthma poorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-asthma-in-older-adults/abstract/69-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">69-71</a>].
