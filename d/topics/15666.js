A &quot;fracture&quot; is another word for a broken bone.</p><p>There are different kinds of shinbone fractures. The type of shinbone fracture depends on which part of the shinbone breaks and how it breaks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22312029\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a shinbone fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of a shinbone fracture include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limping or being unable to put weight on the leg</p><p/><p>A shinbone fracture can also make the leg look like it's bent in an abnormal position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22312044\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a shinbone fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms, do an exam, and order an X-ray of your leg.</p><p>Some people need other imaging tests, such as a CT or MRI scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22312059\"><span class=\"h1\">How are shinbone fractures treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of shinbone fracture you have and how severe it is.</p><p>For the first 1 to 2 days after your injury, you can help reduce swelling by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not putting weight on your leg</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raising your leg above the level of your heart, for example, by propping it up on pillows</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting ice on the area &ndash; You can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. You should put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. You should use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after your injury. Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after their injury.</p><p/><p>Shinbone fractures are usually treated with a cast. But your doctor will probably wait a few days for your swelling to get better before he or she puts on a cast. While you wait for the swelling to get better, your doctor will have you wear a splint.</p><p>Before your doctor puts on a cast, he or she will make sure that your shinbone is in the correct position. If your shinbone is not in the correct position, you will need surgery to put the bone back in the correct position.</p><p>During surgery, the doctor will put the shinbone back in the correct position by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using screws, pins, rods, or plates to fix the bone inside the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting pins or screws through the skin and into the bone, and then attaching the pins or screws to a bar that is outside the skin</p><p/><p>Your doctor will also treat your pain. If you have a lot of pain or a severe fracture, he or she will prescribe a strong pain medicine. If you have a mild fracture, he or she will recommend that you take an over-the-counter medicine for your pain. Over-the counter-medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve).</p><p>Sometimes, a shinbone fracture leads to an abnormal build-up of pressure in a group of muscles in the leg. Although this is uncommon, it is an emergency and needs to be treated with surgery. During surgery, the doctor will cut open the group of muscles and the covering around them to relieve the pressure.</p><p>After your fracture heals, your doctor might recommend that you work with a physical therapist (exercise expert). The physical therapist can show you exercises and stretches to strengthen your muscles and help your joints move more easily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22312074\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do shinbone fractures take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most shinbone fractures take months to heal. The healing time depends on how mild or severe the fracture is.</p><p>Healing time also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal much more quickly than older adults or adults with other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22312089\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your fracture is healing. He or she will tell you how long you need to use crutches, and when you can put weight on your leg again.</p><p>Your doctor will also probably recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a healthy diet that includes getting enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not smoke. A fracture can take longer to heal if you smoke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22312127\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call him or her if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your pain or swelling gets worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have numbness or tingling in your toes, or your toes look blue or purple</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You damage your cast or get it wet, and it's not supposed to get wet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22312142\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute compartment syndrome (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
