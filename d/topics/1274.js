As in most of neurology, the initial goal when confronted with a patient with sensory loss is localization of the lesion using information from the history and physical examination. This narrows the differential diagnosis and directs further investigations. Localization requires an understanding of the anatomy of the sensory system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY OF THE SENSORY SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perception of a somatic sensation depends on detection of a stimulus by specialized receptors in the skin, muscle, or joints. Information from these receptors is then transmitted via peripheral nerves to the central nervous system. With the exception of the mesencephalic nucleus, whose projections carry proprioceptive information from the muscles of mastication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the cell bodies of the primary sensory neurons that constitute the peripheral nerves reside in ganglia outside of the central nervous system. Projections from these ganglia then enter the central nervous system to synapse with second order neurons.</p><p>The peripheral nerves are made up of large myelinated fibers that transmit proprioceptive, vibratory, pressure, and touch stimuli, and small, poorly myelinated fibers that transmit pain, temperature, and touch stimuli. (Note that touch is transmitted by both large and small fibers.) Projections from the cell bodies receiving pain, temperature, and touch stimuli enter the spinal cord via the dorsal nerve root. These fibers terminate in the dorsal horns, fanning out over several segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They synapse with the second order neurons in the dorsal horns. These neurons then cross the midline of the cord in the anterior commissure in front of the central canal, and these second order neurons ascend (now on the opposite side of the spinal cord to the peripheral nerve) in either the anterior spinothalamic tract (touch) or the lateral spinothalamic tract (pain and temperature) to the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Here, they synapse with neurons which ascend to the primary sensory cortex in the parietal lobe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61109\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61109 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Projections from the dorsal root ganglia that carry proprioceptive, vibratory, pressure, and touch stimuli directly enter the dorsal columns from the dorsal roots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The gracile column is medial and carries stimuli from the lumbar and thoracic region; the cuneate column begins laterally in the cervical region, which it subserves. Thus, the dorsal columns consist of first order neurons traveling ipsilateral to the peripheral nerve from which they originate. These neurons synapse with second order neurons in the cuneate and gracile nuclei of the medulla. These second order neurons cross in the dorsal midline of the medulla and ascend through the brainstem as the medial lemniscus to the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus where they synapse with third order neurons which project through the internal capsule and the centrum semiovale to the primary sensory cortex in the parietal lobe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78866\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78866 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>As with the motor cortex, the primary sensory cortex is arranged somatotopically, with the face represented laterally, close to the Sylvian fissure. The hand and arm are represented just above the region for the face and the leg is represented medially, similar to the layout of the motor homunculus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensory loss is categorized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoesthesia is the diminished ability to perceive pain, temperature, touch, or vibration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthesia is the complete inability to perceive pain, temperature, touch, or vibration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypalgesia is the decreased sensitivity to painful stimuli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analgesia is the complete insensitivity to painful stimuli.</p><p/><p>Hyperpathia, hyperesthesia, and allodynia refer to an increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SENSORY EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the sensory examination is to &quot;localize the lesion.&quot; This portion of the examination tends to be subjective because it relies on the patient's responses to various stimuli; thus, it is usually done following the motor examination. With the more objective data obtained from the motor examination, the examiner is often able to narrow down a differential and proceed with a more focused sensory examination, resulting in less frustration for both the patient and examiner. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults#H72\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;, section on 'Sensory examination'</a>.)</p><p>The primary sensory modalities usually are examined first. These include touch, proprioception, vibration, temperature, and pain. Abnormalities in these sensations may occur with any sensory syndrome (eg, peripheral nerve injury, radiculopathy, spinal cord syndromes, thalamic and cerebral hemispheric syndromes). A disproportionate loss of vibration sense and proprioception, compared with pain and temperature sensation, tends to occur with diseases of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord (eg, tabes dorsalis, vitamin B12 deficiency, multiple sclerosis) and also with demyelinating neuropathies and sensory neuronopathies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-treatment-and-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Treatment and monitoring&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Higher cortical sensation can be examined if touch sensation remains relatively preserved and the patient is suspected of having a cortical lesion. Examination of cortical sensation includes two point discrimination, graphesthesia, stereognosis, and extinction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two point discrimination is the ability to recognize two points applied simultaneously to the skin as distinct from a single point. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults#H79\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;, section on 'Two-point discrimination'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Graphesthesia is the ability of the patient to identify numbers or letters drawn in the palm of the hand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stereognosis is the ability to recognize common objects such as keys, coins or paper clips by touching or handling them with one's eyes closed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extinction is evaluated by simultaneously touching two separate points on either side of the body. The test is abnormal if the patient consistently identifies the stimulus on only one side of the body. Extinction is seen in relatively large parietal lesions.</p><p/><p>The Romberg is a test of proprioception. It is positive when the patient is able to stand with feet together and eyes open without losing his balance but is unable to remain steady with the eyes closed. This occurs because patients are using their eyes to compensate for the lack of sensory feedback they are receiving from their lower extremities. A functional correlate of this often comes out in the history when the patient notes that he loses his balance when he gets up at night in a darkened room.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATTERNS OF SENSORY LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history and physical examination are key to determining the cause of sensory loss. Ancillary studies may be helpful in selected circumstances.</p><p>Sensory loss that is confined to a part of a limb suggests injury to a peripheral nerve, nerve plexus, or spinal root (eg, mononeuropathy or radiculopathy). In contrast, sensory loss involving most of an extremity or the trunk suggests the presence of other disorders, that may be distinguished as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72447\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72447 \">figure 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of both sides of the body is consistent with a polyneuropathy or spinal cord disease, while involvement of one side is consistent with contralateral disease of the brainstem, thalamus, or cerebral cortex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sensory level is consistent with spinal cord disease or, more rarely, lateral medullary infarction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory loss of the face can result from lesions in the upper cervical spine, brainstem, thalamus, or cerebral hemispheres. With lower brainstem disease (eg, lateral medullary syndrome), the sensory loss on the face is typically opposite that of the body, although ipsilateral sensory loss has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; sensory loss is on the same side of the face and body with upper brainstem, thalamic, or hemispheric disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Stocking-glove&quot; sensory loss is most commonly seen with length dependent axonal neuropathies, although other disorders may also present with this pattern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disproportionate loss of vibration sense and proprioception, compared with pain and temperature sensation, tends to occur with diseases of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord (eg, tabes dorsalis, vitamin B12 deficiency, multiple sclerosis) and demyelinating polyneuropathy.</p><p/><p>A number of these disorders are discussed in more detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropathy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Mononeuropathy and radiculopathy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mononeuropathies refer to pathology affecting an individual peripheral nerve. Mononeuropathies are diagnosed clinically based on signs and symptoms that correlate with an individual nerve distribution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F54042\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54042 \">figure 4</a>).<br/><br/>One common example is carpal tunnel syndrome; patients with carpal tunnel syndrome frequently complain of numbness and tingling in the median nerve distribution that can be particularly bothersome at night, often awakening them from sleep. This may or may not be accompanied by wrist pain that can radiate up the arm or into the hand. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiculopathies refer to pathology affecting the nerve root, resulting in signs and symptoms in the corresponding dermatome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50419\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419 \">figure 6</a>) and myotome. Because of the overlap in nerve root innervation of both individual muscles and dermatomes, weakness and sensory loss can be mild <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> not involve the entire region described on the <span class=\"nowrap\">dermatome/myotome</span> maps. Instead, smaller &quot;signature zones&quot; of sensory loss may define the level of nerve root involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73889\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73889 \">table 1</a>). Although radiculopathies may not cause significant sensory loss, they characteristically result in paroxysmal severe lancinating pain that may be exacerbated by coughing, sneezing, or straining.</p><p/><p>Occasionally it is difficult to differentiate a mononeuropathy from a radiculopathy clinically. As an example, both a peroneal nerve palsy and an L5 root lesion can result in a drop foot and numbness over the lateral aspect of the leg and dorsum of the foot. Electrodiagnostic testing (nerve conduction studies and electromyography) are useful in distinguishing between these conditions. In a peroneal palsy, nerve conduction studies may demonstrate focal slowing in the peroneal nerve at the fibular head, while in an L5 radiculopathy there may be evidence of denervation in L5 muscles outside of the peroneal territory (eg, tibialis posterior or flexor digitorum longus, both of which are innervated by the tibial portion of the sciatic nerve). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a>.) <br/></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Distal sensory polyneuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stocking-glove sensory loss is a term used to describe sensory loss affecting the distal lower and upper extremities that is most commonly seen in length-dependent axonal neuropathies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Axonal neuropathies are most frequently due to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin B12 deficiency</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syphilis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human immunodeficiency virus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lyme disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uremia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasculitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraneoplastic neuropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amyloidosis</p><p/><p>With axonal neuropathies, the longest axons are affected first. Thus, symptoms start distally and progress proximally. Patients typically do not have noticeable numbness in their hands until the sensory symptoms or signs have progressed to the knee.</p><p>The examination usually reveals a decrease in vibration threshold, pinprick, and temperature distally. Diminished proprioception at the great toe is typically also evident on careful examination, but can be difficult to detect. In combined large and small fiber neuropathies, the ankle jerk is frequently diminished or absent. Patients with pure small fiber neuropathies will primarily demonstrate loss of pinprick and temperature distally, although vibration perception can also be affected. Proprioception and deep tendon reflexes remain intact.</p><p>Length dependent axonal neuropathies are generally very slowly progressive. Other etiologies need to be considered if the patient presents with a stocking-glove pattern of sensory loss in which symptoms present in the hands and feet simultaneously, or if the symptoms evolve quickly over several days to weeks.</p><p>Occasionally patients with mononeuritis multiplex due to vasculitis do not seek medical attention unless their symptoms and signs progress to become confluent and resemble a stocking-glove pattern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-vasculitic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of vasculitic neuropathy&quot;</a>.) The history and examination help to differentiate mononeuritis multiplex from a length dependent axonal neuropathy: the patient will give a history of stepwise sensory loss in discrete nerve distributions (eg, ulnar aspect of hand, then peroneal distribution in foot, etc). Furthermore, weakness, which is not usually a significant complaint in length dependent axonal neuropathies, typically accompanies the sensory loss in mononeuritis multiplex.</p><p>Patients with Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome may present with numbness or paresthesias affecting their feet and hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In this situation, the symptoms will have been present only a short time before the patient presents to medical attention. There may or may not be a history of an antecedent infection. The patient develops progressive weakness soon after the onset of sensory loss or paresthesias. The examination should reveal areflexia or depressed reflexes. Sensory loss should be minimal in comparison to the weakness and predominantly affects the larger myelinated fibers carrying proprioception and vibration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, patients with a variant of CIDP (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy) present with a history and examination that are most suggestive of a length dependent axonal neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In this situation, the symptoms and signs are predominantly distal and sensory as opposed to the more common form of CIDP where symmetric proximal and distal motor weakness is the predominant symptom. EMG and nerve conduction studies are helpful in differentiating this variant of CIDP from an axonal neuropathy.</p><p>Central lesions affecting the cervical spinal cord can also present with a stocking-glove pattern of sensory loss. In the younger population, this may be the presenting symptom of a demyelinating lesion in the cervical cord. In the older population, this is frequently caused by cervical spondylosis with cord impingement. Imaging studies (eg, magnetic resonance imaging) are required to positively identify the precise etiology. Hyperreflexia, spasticity (clonus, increased tone), and extensor plantar responses are helpful in pointing to a central cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensory neuronopathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensory neuronopathies are very rare causes of sensory loss. They result from degeneration at the level of the dorsal root ganglion and manifest with sensory ataxia, absent reflexes, and dysesthesias, as well as sensory loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. They are differentiated from length-dependent sensory neuropathies in several ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory neuronopathies do not necessarily follow a length-dependent pattern. In addition, they are frequently asymmetric. As an example, patients may present with initial numbness in a dermatomal distribution in one hand or even in the face.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory neuronopathies lack motor involvement. In contrast, patients with length dependent neuropathies may not complain of weakness, but mild motor abnormalities can often be found on detailed clinical examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nerve conduction studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory neuronopathies tend to be much more disabling than length-dependent axonal neuropathies. As they progress, patients develop profound sensory ataxia, and almost always decline to the point where mobility aids are required (eg, cane, walker <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wheelchair).</p><p/><p>Sensory neuronopathies are often idiopathic in etiology. &#160;However, they may be associated with paraneoplastic phenomenon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The latter is most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer and the presence of anti-Hu antibodies.

These studies are also helpful for discriminating whether sensory pathology is proximal or distal to the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). As an example, radiculopathies that are caused by pathology proximal to the DRG result in sensory loss in the corresponding dermatome, but nerve conduction studies reveal normal sensory responses. In contrast, axonal lesions at or distal to the DRG result in low amplitude or absent sensory responses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;</a>.)</p><p><br/>Imaging with peripheral nerve ultrasound is also increasingly used in the diagnosis of mononeuropathies.

In two separate studies of patients referred to tertiary care neuromuscular clinics for evaluation of peripheral neuropathy, approximately one-quarter remained undiagnosed after extensive workup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal cord lesions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Cape distribution sensory loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cape distribution sensory loss is an uncommon but well described pattern of sensory loss resulting from lesions of the central cervical cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72447\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72447 \">figure 3</a>). The classic presentation involves diminution or loss of sensation for pinprick and temperature across the upper back, shoulders, and upper arms resulting from lesions that involve spinothalamic neurons as they cross in the anterior commissure in the cervical cord. The differential diagnosis includes tumor, syrinx, and demyelination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Brown-Sequard syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Brown-Sequard syndrome results from a lesion involving only one side of the spinal cord. In this situation, the patient presents with diminished proprioception, vibration, and weakness on the side ipsilateral to the lesion, and decreased pinprick and temperature sensation on the contralateral side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72447\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72447 \">figure 3</a>). Hyperesthesia or pain may also occur ipsilateral to the lesion. Small lesions, such as those caused by demyelination, can result in isolated involvement of dorsal columns or spinothalamic tracts resulting in ipsilateral abnormalities in proprioception and vibration or contralateral abnormalities in pinprick and temperature, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging method of choice in suspected spinal cord lesions as it is far more sensitive than CT in this situation. When a spinal cord lesion is suspected it is important to remember that the sensory level found on examination indicates that the lesion itself is at or <strong>above</strong> that level. The spinal cord levels or dermatomes are presented for the upper and lower extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53006 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50419\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50419 \">figure 6</a>). It is not uncommon for patients to present with an ascending pattern of sensory loss from a cervical cord lesion. Depending on when the patient is examined, different sensory levels will be found for the same lesion. Thus, in working up suspected spinal cord lesions, the physician must image the cord from the neck (cervical region) to the sensory level found on examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Brainstem lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several classic patterns of sensory loss found with lesions at various levels of the brainstem. Most brainstem lesions involve cranial nerves <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their nuclei. The resultant signs and symptoms tend to be more useful in localizing the lesion than are the sensory findings in isolation.</p><p>Wallenberg syndrome is probably the most well known brainstem abnormality leading to sensory loss. It results from a lesion of the lateral medulla and was originally described as involving pain and temperature loss on the ipsilateral face and contralateral limbs and trunk. However, several other patterns of pain and temperature loss have been described in association with this syndrome, including contralateral face and bilateral face involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Accompanying signs and symptoms include loss of vibration and proprioception as well as ataxia in the ipsilateral limbs. An ipsilateral Horner syndrome, vertigo, nystagmus, hoarseness, and dysphagia are often present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posterior-circulation-cerebrovascular-syndromes#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes&quot;, section on 'Lateral medullary infarction'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal initial investigation when the history and examination suggest a brainstem lesion is a brain MRI. Head CT scans are rarely useful as the artifact resulting from the skull base obscures the brainstem images.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Thalamic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thalamic lesions may cause a contralateral sensory deficit that involves all sensory modalities to varying degrees. Although tumors and abscesses can involve the thalamus, typically the onset of sensory loss in thalamic lesions is acute or subacute and is the result of a lacunar infarct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lacunar-infarcts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lacunar infarcts&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thalamic pain syndrome, a type of central post-stroke pain, has been well described and is not uncommon in the recovery phase of these infarcts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-sensory-loss/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Often the sensory examination is normal but the patient experiences severe pain that may be paroxysmal and exacerbated by touch over the contralateral hemibody.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensory cortex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Discrete lesions of the sensory cortex are unusual. When they occur only a small part of the body is affected (corresponding to the region of the homunculus where the lesion is found). Any lesion large enough to affect a significant area of the body will result in other associated symptoms.</p><p>Cortical signs and symptoms, including aphasia, neglect, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cortical sensory loss (eg, graphesthesia), are useful in placing a lesion in the cortex. However, cortical signs and symptoms can only be assessed in patients who have adequate sensation for primary modalities; profound alteration of the primary sensory modalities, particularly touch, prevents sensory information from reaching the cerebral hemisphere, thereby rendering cortical sensory tests inaccurate.</p><p>Either a head CT scan or MRI is a useful initial investigation in the workup of cortical or thalamic sensory loss, although MRI is more sensitive in the diagnosis of demyelinating lesions (eg, multiple sclerosis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following is a simplified approach to the localization of the lesion responsible for sensory loss:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Is disease confined to part of a limb or most of an extremity or trunk?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease that is confined to part of a limb is consistent with mononeuropathy or radiculopathy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mononeuropathies may involve disorders of the upper extremity (eg, median [carpal tunnel syndrome], ulnar, radial nerves or brachial plexopathy) or lower extremity (eg, peroneal, posterior tibial [tarsal tunnel], femoral, or lateral femoral cutaneous nerves [meralgia paresthetica], (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78221 \">table 3</a>)).

Sensory loss may be relatively mild with radiculopathies or may only involve small &quot;signature zones&quot; rather than entire dermatomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73889\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73889 \">table 1</a>); paroxysmal severe lancinating pain is common.</p><p/><p>Sensory alteration that involves most of an extremity or trunk is consistent with polyneuropathy, spinal cord disease, or central nervous system problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">For sensory loss that involves most of a limb or trunk, is one or both sides of the body involved?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyneuropathy and spinal cord disease present with sensory loss on both sides of the body:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyneuropathy may be caused by a variety of systemic diseases, drugs, or toxins.
