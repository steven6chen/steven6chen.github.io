Such approaches are designed to reduce specific hazards in each individual case (eg, ensuring performance of the correct procedure on the correct site, ensuring administration of the appropriate antibiotic to prevent infection, anticipation of positioning issues, availability and function of necessary equipment, planned use of radiation, extra precautions for fire protection if warranted).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3852358388\"><span class=\"h2\">Reviews of informed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial review of the surgical consent occurs in the preoperative holding area. This critical part of preparation confirms the patient's identity and his or her understanding of the specific surgical or interventional procedure to be performed, as well as the side of the planned procedure. (See <a href=\"#H2048331105\" class=\"local\">'Wrong procedure or wrong site surgery'</a> below.) </p><p>Details for obtaining<strong> </strong>appropriate informed consent are discussed elsewhere.

Documents are checked to prevent errors by verifying patient identity using dual identifiers, as well as verifying the procedure, side, site, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> level (see <a href=\"#H2048331105\" class=\"local\">'Wrong procedure or wrong site surgery'</a> below). This preoperative timeout process should include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Participation of the patient or a surrogate to verify identifying information</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Participation of at least two medical professionals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Documentation in the chart. </p><p/><p>Another timeout is necessary prior to performing any regional block since wrong-side blocks are as common as wrong-side surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operating-room-hazards-and-approaches-to-improve-patient-safety/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Just before surgical incision, a final timeout is performed with participation of the entire OR team, again including the patient's identity with dual identifiers, the surgical procedure to be performed, and the surgical site, side, or level. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H585585358\"><span class=\"h2\">Checklists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standardized checklist should be employed in the OR prior to the start of every case. The checklist serves as a cognitive aid with a structured presentation of information to ensure that no steps of a process are missed and that safety measures are followed. Ideally, this presentation includes a surgeon-led briefing (see <a href=\"#H881363500\" class=\"local\">'Briefings'</a> below). An example is the World Health Organization (WHO) surgical safety checklist, which provides a set of checks to be done at three stages of a surgical procedure (sign in, time out, and sign out) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F52392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52392 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>In one 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of the WHO surgical safety checklist on postoperative complications, adherence to aspects of care embedded in the checklist was associated with a 40 percent reduction in postoperative complications after implementation (relative risk [RR] 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.74; five studies, n = 15,198 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operating-room-hazards-and-approaches-to-improve-patient-safety/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In another 2014 systematic review, the use of any surgical checklist compared with standard practice led to a 37 percent reduction in complications (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.58-0.72; seven studies, n = 37,339 patients) without change in mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operating-room-hazards-and-approaches-to-improve-patient-safety/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>A single retrospective survey that included 215,000 patients in all acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, assessed the effects of universal adoption of the WHO or other similar checklist and reported no association between implementation of such surgical safety checklists and reduction in operative mortality or other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operating-room-hazards-and-approaches-to-improve-patient-safety/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, this study has several limitations in that no team training or other support was provided in these hospitals, and data were ascertained only by survey. It is likely that partial use or implementation of any checklist without adequate training and team buy-in results in limited improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operating-room-hazards-and-approaches-to-improve-patient-safety/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Experts agree that the benefits of a checklist depend upon relevant design and content, adequate introduction and training, appropriate implementation, and enthusiastic adoption because it is the adaptive work of the team that generates measurable improvements, rather than the technology of the checklist itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operating-room-hazards-and-approaches-to-improve-patient-safety/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H881363500\"><span class=\"h2\">Briefings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before surgery, a surgeon-led preoperative briefing or &quot;huddle&quot; that goes beyond a simple checklist should also be performed.

In a retrospective study of 313,066 adult patients undergoing major surgery with a duration of at least two hours, a complete transfer of anesthesia care from one clinician anesthesiologist to another, that is, where the first anesthesiologist was no longer available or involved in the case, occurred in 5941 patients; in 307,125 cases, the same anesthesiologist started and finished the case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operating-room-hazards-and-approaches-to-improve-patient-safety/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

Although the CUSP program is integrated into the hospital's strategic plan, it takes advantage of local unit's experience. A pre- and post-implementation evaluation of CUSP in two surgical intensive care (ICU) units noted improvement in safety culture and reduction in ICU length of stay, medication errors, and possibly nursing turnover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operating-room-hazards-and-approaches-to-improve-patient-safety/abstract/164,166,167\" class=\"abstract_t\">164,166,167</a>].</p><p>Key elements of the CUSP program include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staff education regarding safety science.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of potential hazards.
