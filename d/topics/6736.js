It is a spirochetal infection caused by <em>Borrelia </em>species (<em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> in the United States, and primarily <em>Borrelia afzelii</em> and <em>Borrelia garinii</em> in Europe and Asia) and is transmitted by the bite of infected <em>Ixodes</em> <em>ricinus</em> complex ticks. Lyme disease can involve the skin, joints, nervous system, and heart. In the United States, <em>Ixodes</em> ticks can also transmit human granulocytic anaplasmosis and babesiosis. In Europe, they can also transmit tick-borne encephalitis virus.</p><p>Ticks have three stages in their life cycle: larva, nymph, and adult. Lyme disease is most commonly transmitted by nymphal ticks, which are typically most active during the late spring and early summer in temperate regions. Adult ticks can also transmit Lyme disease, but this occurs less commonly because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans and because they are larger and thus more likely to be detected and removed promptly. Adult ticks are most active on warm days in the fall.</p><p>Individuals at highest risk for Lyme disease are those who live in an endemic region and have occupational (eg, forestry and telephone line workers) or recreational (eg, hunting, camping, hiking, gardening, children playing in wooded areas) exposure to ticks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80168\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80168 \">figure 1</a>). However, in highly endemic areas, people may be at risk even in their yards, particularly where grassy areas and woodlands meet.</p><p>The factors affecting transmission of Lyme disease, methods for tick removal, and indications for antibiotic prophylaxis following a tick bite are reviewed here. The epidemiology, microbiology, prevention, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of Lyme disease are discussed separately.

Patients sometimes confuse tick bites with bites by other types of arthropods. As an example, in one study 6 percent of specimens submitted by clinicians for tick identification were actually arthropods (most commonly beetles and lice) rather than ticks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insect bites&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nymphal <em>Ixodes</em> ticks are typically tiny and round (about the size of a poppy seed). Nymphal stages of the American dog tick, <em>Dermacentor variabilis</em>, rarely bite humans, and nymphal stages of the lone star tick, <em>Amblyomma americanum</em>, are larger in comparison to <em>Ixodes</em> ticks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53018\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53018 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68309 \">figure 2</a>). <em>Amblyomma</em> ticks are found primarily in southern and mid-Atlantic states (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75053\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75053 \">figure 3</a>). The 10 states with the highest incidence of Lyme disease include Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts along the Atlantic seaboard, as well as Minnesota and Wisconsin in the upper Midwest. In recent years, the incidence of Lyme disease in the northern New England states of Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire has increased rapidly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80168\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80168 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82242\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82242 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Adult <em>Ixodes scapularis</em> are larger than nymphal forms. Unengorged adults are approximately 3 mm in length. Female <em>Ixodes </em>ticks are orange-reddish, with a dark brown oval-shaped structure called a scutum covering the superior portion of the dorsal surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81981\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81981 \">picture 2</a>); in contrast, the dorsal surface of male <em>Ixodes</em> ticks is uniformly brown since the entire surface is covered by a large scutum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68309 \">figure 2</a>). Adult female <em>A. americanum</em> ticks have a solitary white spot on their back (the &quot;lone star&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71086\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71086 \">picture 3</a>). Adult male <em>A. americanum</em> ticks have an interconnected ring of white markings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68309\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68309 \">figure 2</a>). <em>Dermacentor</em> and <em>Amblyomma</em> ticks are not vectors of Lyme disease, although the former can transmit Rocky Mountain spotted fever and the latter is the vector of human monocytic ehrlichiosis. <em>Amblyomma</em> ticks have also been implicated in STARI (Southern tick-associated rash illness), which causes an expanding skin lesion similar to erythema migrans (EM). Although an infectious agent is thought to be the cause of STARI, none has yet been conclusively identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. While the skin lesion of STARI is similar to the EM rash of Lyme disease, STARI is not known to have the later manifestations associated with Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rocky-mountain-spotted-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=southern-tick-associated-rash-illness-stari\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tick attachment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ticks that are feeding are firmly attached to the skin. A tiny, round tick that is walking on the skin surface or that is easily removed has not yet started the feeding process and is thus not capable of transmitting Lyme disease.</p><p>The duration of tick attachment is important in assessing the risk of transmission of Lyme disease. <em>B. burgdorferi</em> are rarely transmitted within the first 48 hours of tick attachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of Lyme disease prevention found that among subjects bitten by nymphal ticks in whom the duration of attachment could be estimated, the risk of Lyme disease was 25 percent if the tick had fed for 72 hours compared with 0 percent if the tick had fed for a shorter period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A separate study found that the incidence of Lyme disease was significantly higher when the duration of attachment was at least 72 hours: 3 of 15 such patients (20 percent) developed Lyme disease, compared with 1 of 94 (1 percent) in whom the tick was attached for less than 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, the risk of Lyme disease transmission from a firmly attached but unengorged tick was only 1 percent in a trial that was performed in a Lyme-endemic area in which approximately 15 percent of ticks were infected with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>As feeding ticks become engorged with blood, they release their saliva into the bite wound. However, animal studies suggest that spirochetes are not found in the tick&rsquo;s saliva until approximately 48 hours after it starts to feed. One study, for example, found that spirochetes are restricted to the lumen of the tick gut in unfed <em>Ixodes</em> ticks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. When the nymphal ticks fed on mice, the number of spirochetes in the gut subsequently increased. It was only after 48 hours of feeding that the spirochetes disseminated to the salivary glands. Although similar studies have not been done in humans, it is anticipated that the behavior of the organism will be similar.</p><p>The 48-hour period required for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> to migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands of the <em>Ixodes</em> tick contrasts with the much shorter time required for ticks of the same species to transmit the organisms that cause human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA, previously called human granulocyte ehrlichiosis; <em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</em>) and babesiosis (<em>Babesia microti</em>). <em>Babesia</em> and <em>Anaplasma</em> spp are present in the tick's salivary glands before feeding has begun [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Thus, the duration of tick attachment is less important for the risk assessment of transmission of these diseases. The transmission times for other less common tick borne illnesses (eg, <em>Borrelia miyamotoi</em>, Powassan virus) are not well understood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=babesiosis-microbiology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Babesiosis: Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthropod-borne-encephalitides#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arthropod-borne encephalitides&quot;, section on 'Powassan virus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=borrelia-miyamotoi-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Borrelia miyamotoi infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although it is often difficult to determine how long a tick has been attached, it may be helpful if the patient can remember a situation in which he or she could have acquired a tick bite (eg, a walk through the woods).</p><p>Ticks detach and fall off after becoming engorged from a blood meal. Engorged ticks are larger and have a globular shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53018\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53018 \">picture 1</a>). Thus, if a patient reports finding an engorged tick (on their body or in their home), the risk of disease transmission is probably higher.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When an attached tick is detected, the first step involves tick removal. Selected patients who seek care after detecting an attached tick may receive antimicrobial prophylaxis if they meet specific criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69071\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69071 \">table 2</a>). These issues are discussed in detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Tick removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using proper technique for tick removal is important. Several methods of tick removal have been advocated. A study that evaluated the use of forceps or protected fingers, or the application of petroleum jelly, fingernail polish, isopropyl alcohol, or a hot match, found that only the use of forceps or protected fingers resulted in the satisfactory removal of 29 adult American dog ticks without leaving the mouthparts in the host skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The proper technique for removal of the attached tick includes the following steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If available, use tweezers or small forceps to grasp the tick as close to the skin surface as possible. In the absence of tweezers, use paper or cloth to protect the fingers during tick extraction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pull straight up gently but firmly, using steady pressure. Do not jerk or twist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not squeeze, crush, or puncture the body of the tick, since its fluids may contain infectious agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disinfect the skin thoroughly after removing the tick and wash hands with soap and water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If sections of the mouthparts of the tick remain in the skin, they should be left alone as they will normally be expelled spontaneously.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the tick removal and the skin cleansing, the person bitten (or the parents) should observe the area for the development of EM for up to 30 days following exposure. Components of tick saliva can cause transient erythema that should not be confused with EM.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the tick usually needs to be attached for two to three days before transmission of the Lyme disease agent occurs, removal of the tick within this time frame often prevents the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11674211\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimicrobial prophylaxis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy and rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis with a single dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> has been demonstrated to be effective in patients who meet a specified set of criteria. The rationale for this approach is discussed here.</p><p>The characteristic rash of Lyme disease, EM occurs in approximately 80 percent of patients infected with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81270 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57414\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57414 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75337\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75337 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67424\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67424 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Treatment at this early stage of illness results in complete resolution of symptoms in at least 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Lyme disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;, section on 'Erythema migrans'</a>.)</p><p>Some clinicians and patients have expressed concerns that treating only patients who show signs of illness will leave a subset of individuals with untreated subclinical disease. It has been hypothesized that such patients may then progress to more serious and difficult to treat sequelae. If this were true, then preemptive therapy or repeated serologic testing after a tick bite might be considered. However, two randomized controlled trials of antibiotic prophylaxis for Lyme disease in the United States found no evidence of seroconversion in a total of 869 asymptomatic individuals who had recent tick bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. Follow-up of subjects enrolled in a Lyme vaccine trial showed asymptomatic seroconversion in up to 10 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, these cases were not directly associated with an identified tick bite.</p><p>Several studies have investigated the efficacy of giving antibiotics at the time of a tick bite to prevent Lyme disease. Three randomized, placebo-controlled trials found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> administered after a tick bite did not protect against the subsequent development of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/8,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,18</a>]. However, these trials were small (387, 56, and 184 patients, respectively), and all three were underpowered to demonstrate a significant effect of prophylactic therapy, given the low incidence of Lyme disease after a tick bite even in endemic areas. A meta-analysis of these three studies also failed to demonstrate a significant beneficial effect of antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>A subsequent randomized, double-blind trial involving 482 patients residing in an endemic area from whom <em>I. scapularis</em> ticks had been removed within the previous 72 hours demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (200 mg orally as a single dose) was effective in preventing Lyme disease (0.4 versus 3.2 percent for placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Only engorged nymphal ticks transmitted the disease. However, doxycycline caused more adverse effects than placebo (30 versus 11 percent). The most common side effects of doxycycline were nausea and vomiting.</p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> prophylaxis was 87 percent in this trial, but the 95 percent confidence interval was wide (25 to 98 percent) because there were few cases of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Data from this trial suggest that it would be necessary to give doxycycline to approximately 40 people to prevent one case of Lyme disease; 125 people would need to be treated if the efficacy was at the lower end of the calculated confidence interval. These estimates were based on exposure to ticks in an area with a relatively high incidence of Lyme disease (Westchester County, New York, where the incidence of Lyme disease was 0.5 to 1.0 reported cases per 1000 persons per at the time of the study). In most areas of the United States, the risk of Lyme disease is much lower, and thus the benefit of prophylactic doxycycline would be correspondingly much lower as well.</p><p>Other investigators used data from various studies to assess the cost-benefit analysis of antibiotic prophylaxis for Lyme disease following a tick bite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. They concluded that prophylaxis would be warranted if the incidence of Lyme disease following a tick bite was 3.6 percent. In the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> prophylaxis trial described above, the risk of Lyme disease in patients bitten by nymphal ticks was higher if the tick was at least partially engorged (10 percent) than if it appeared flat (0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, antibiotic prophylaxis may be cost-effective after removal of an engorged <em>Ixodes</em> tick in Lyme-endemic regions.</p><p>A potential concern with antibiotic prophylaxis is that if it is not successful in eradicating the bacteria whether there will be changes in the course of infection that will make it difficult to diagnose Lyme disease or make it more resistant to subsequent treatment. There is currently no evidence to support this concern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines that recommend antibiotic prophylaxis only in patients who meet <strong>all</strong> of the following criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69071\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69071 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attached tick identified as an adult or nymphal <em>I. scapularis</em> tick (deer tick).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tick is estimated to have been attached for &ge;36 hours (by degree of engorgement or time of exposure).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylaxis is begun within 72 hours of tick removal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local rate of infection of ticks with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> is &ge;20 percent (these rates of infection have been shown to occur in parts of New England, parts of the mid-Atlantic States, and parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> is not contraindicated (ie, the patient is not &lt;8 years of age, pregnant, or lactating).</p><p/><p>If the patient meets all of these criteria, the recommended dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> is 200 mg for adults and 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> up to a maximum dose of 200 mg in children &ge;8 years, given as a single dose. It is important to note that this regimen has never been tested in children; this recommendation is extrapolated from experience in adults.</p><p>Given the high rate of development of EM in patients who are infected with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and the excellent outcomes with early therapy, observation of the tick bite site with treatment for Lyme disease if an EM rash develops is an acceptable alternative for patients who meet criteria for antibiotic prophylaxis. This approach may be preferred in some patients in endemic areas who have frequent tick exposures and therefore might meet criteria for prophylaxis on multiple occasions; such patients may wish to avoid repeated use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>. The treatment of Lyme disease is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease#H2881503692\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Special considerations'</a>.)</p><p>Following the onset of EM:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgM antibodies to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> typically appear within one to two weeks. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgG antibodies to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> typically appear within one to six weeks, depending upon the type of test that is used (eg, C6 versus Western blot). </p><p/><p>Thus, we do not obtain serologic testing with the aim of diagnosing a new infection at the time of the bite. However, obtaining a baseline serology in patients who have been treated for Lyme disease in the past is helpful because it can serve as a comparator to later serologies if signs and symptoms subsequently develop. </p><p>A more detailed discussion on the use of serologic testing for the diagnosis of Lyme disease is found elsewhere.

If the tick has not been attached for at least 36 hours, it is unlikely to have transmitted disease and no prophylaxis should be offered, even if PCR is positive. If the tick has been attached for &ge;36 hours, then prophylaxis is recommended and a delay in initiation of prophylaxis while awaiting results of testing could be detrimental.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3275731330\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The likelihood of transmission is increased if the tick is engorged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> has been attached for at least 72 hours. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Tick attachment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ticks are best removed with tweezers or protected fingers, pulling straight up with even pressure.

If the patient cannot take doxycycline, we do not recommend prophylaxis with an alternate antibiotic. A reasonable alternative for patients who meet criteria for prophylaxis but who prefer not to take antimicrobial prophylaxis is to observe the tick bite site and treat for Lyme disease if an erythema migrans (EM) rash develops.
