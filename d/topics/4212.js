The development of topical anesthetics, tissue adhesives, and fast-absorbing sutures has made the management of lacerations less traumatic for the patient. In addition, the use of procedural sedation for difficult lacerations or for the extremely anxious child has made the experience more tolerable for the patient, family, and physician. The goals of wound management are simple: to avoid wound infection, assist in hemostasis, and to provide an esthetically pleasing scar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The majority of studies now are focusing on the esthetic nature of wound healing rather than infection rates, because infection rates remain low, regardless of management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND PHYSIOLOGY AND HEALING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous layer, and deep fascia are the tissue layers of concern in wound closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The epidermis and dermis are tightly adhered and clinically indistinguishable, and together constitute the skin. Dermal approximation provides the strength and alignment of skin closure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The subcutaneous layer is mainly comprised of adipose tissue. Nerve fibers, blood vessels, and hair follicles are located here. Although this layer provides little strength to the repair, sutures placed in the subcutaneous layer may decrease the tension of the wound and improve the cosmetic result.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The deep fascial layer is intermixed with muscle and occasionally requires repair in deep lacerations.</p><p/><p>The healing process of skin occurs in several stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulation begins immediately following the injury. Vasospasm as well as platelet aggregation and fibrous clot formation occur. During the inflammatory phase, proteolytic enzymes released by neutrophils and macrophages break down damaged tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epithelialization occurs in the epidermis, which is the only layer capable of regeneration. Complete bridging of the wound occurs within 48 hours after suturing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New blood vessel growth peaks four days after the injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collagen formation is necessary to restore tensile strength to the wound. The process begins within 48 hours of the injury and peaks in the first week. Collagen production and remodeling continue for up to 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound contraction occurs three to four days following the injury, and the process is poorly understood. The full wound thickness moves toward the center of the wound, which may affect the final appearance of the wound.</p><p/><p>Systemic disturbances can influence wound healing. These host factors include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, nutritional status, obesity, chemotherapeutic agents, corticosteroids, and anticoagulant or antiplatelet adhering drugs. Disorders of collagen synthesis, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan's syndrome, can also affect wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, patients of African or Asian ethnicity can be prone to hypertrophic scar formation or keloids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;, section on 'Risks for poor outcome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars#H66627080\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keloids and hypertrophic scars&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Local disturbances are more common contributors to abnormal wound healing. These factors include temperature, ischemia, tissue trauma, denervation, and infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temperature, blood supply, and ischemia are interrelated. The higher the temperature of the anatomic area, the greater is the blood supply and resultant oxygen delivery. The skin temperature of the face can be up to 9&deg;F warmer than that of the foot, thus allowing for sutures to remain for shorter periods of time and also allowing for lower infection rates. Different suturing techniques can contribute to tissue ischemia, in particular the vertical mattress suture. Vertical mattress sutures have been shown in animal studies to cause more ischemia than continuous or simple interrupted sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Vertical mattress'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection can occur in any traumatic wound, and all acute wounds are contaminated to a certain degree. An infection occurs when there is an imbalance between host resistance (systemic or local) and bacterial inoculum. The mechanism of injury and the time from injury to potential repair are important considerations. Crush injuries may cause extensive cellular necrosis and higher infection rates than shear injuries due to the greater energy distributed over a larger area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An injury heavily contaminated with dirt, gravel, or other debris also has a higher infection risk. The length of time between the injury and the evaluation also affects infection risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;, section on 'Age of injury'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of minor lacerations begins with assessment and preparation of the wound. Wound assessment includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determination of the mechanism of the injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age of the injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of possible contamination or foreign body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of extent of the wound</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment for neurovascular compromise or tendon injury in the surrounding area</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need for tetanus prophylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of risk factors that might affect healing</p><p/><p>These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;, section on 'Assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31004258\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sutures are appropriate when the depth of the wound will lead to excess scarring if the wound edges are not properly opposed. Typically this is true whenever the laceration extends through the dermis. The table describes key aspects of wounds that impact the selection of a wound closure method (sutures, staples, tissue adhesives, or surgical tape) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F90472\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90472 \">table 2</a>). Some wounds amenable to closure with sutures may be better managed with an alternative technique. For example, staples are frequently used for scalp wounds and for wounds in noncosmetic regions, especially when linear and &gt;5 cm because they permit faster closure. Wounds &lt;5 cm that are not under tension may be closed with tissue adhesives which avoids the pain of suturing. </p><p>Clean, uninfected lacerations on any part of the body in healthy patients may be closed primarily for up to 18 hours following the injury without a significant increase in the risk of wound infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Facial wounds may be closed primarily up to 24 hours following the injury. In select cases, closure of facial wounds may occur up to 48 to 72 hours after injury if there are no signs of infection, the patient has no risk factors for infection, and the wound edges can be approximated easily. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31004266\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concern about wound infection is the main reason not to close a wound primarily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].&nbsp;Wounds that have been grossly contaminated with foreign debris that cannot be completely removed, infected tissue,&nbsp;or noncosmetic wounds that have come to medical attention late should be allowed to heal by granulation (secondary intention) after appropriate cleansing.&nbsp;In addition, patients with risk factors for proper wound healing (eg, immunocompromise, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes mellitus) may warrant delayed primary closure depending upon the age of the wound (eg, &gt;6 hours old) or wound site (eg, hands or feet). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-healing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound healing&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Other situations in which closure with sutures may not be appropriate include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;, section on 'Type of closure'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animal bites, especially in noncosmetic areas (eg, hand, foot) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and initial management of animal and human bites&quot;, section on 'Primary closure'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep puncture wounds in which effective irrigation cannot occur</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wounds in which suturing will cause too much tension across the suture line. In this instance, healing by secondary intention with later scar revision may be a better approach</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wounds that are actively bleeding, especially if the source is arterial (with the exception of scalp wounds). The clinician should establish hemostasis so that a subcutaneous hematoma does not collect and create a potential nidus for infection as well as impede proper healing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial wounds that would be expected to heal without significant scarring, such as lacerations or abrasions that only involve the epidermis. Suturing in these wounds will potentially cause increased scar formation and risk for infection</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wound irrigation, foreign body removal, and necrotic tissue debridement are the main preventative measures against tissue infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;, section on 'Irrigation'</a>.)</p><p>Surfactant cleaners, such as the nonionic surfactant poloxamer 188 (ShurClens), are also safe and useful for wound decontamination. They possess no antibacterial activity, but decrease the mechanical trauma of scrubbing while reducing bacterial load and incidence of infection. A high-porosity sponge (Optipore) is typically used in conjunction to limit local trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This system is ideal for scrubbing large surface areas like &quot;road rash&quot; or burns.</p><p>Debridement has been considered by many to be equally or more important than irrigation in the management of the contaminated wound. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;, section on 'Debridement'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SUTURE MATERIALS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of terms are used to describe the properties of various types of sutures.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical configuration of a suture describes whether it is monofilamentous (Prolene or Ethilon) or multifilamentous (silk). Multifilamentous sutures come in braided and twisted types. Braided types are usually easier to handle and tie, but can harbor bacteria between strands and cause higher infection rates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tensile strength is defined as the amount of weight required to break a suture divided by its cross sectional area. The designation for suture strength is the number of zeros. The higher the number of zeros (1-0 to 10-0), the smaller the size and the lower the strength.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knot strength is the measure of the amount of force required to cause a knot to slip and is directly proportional to the coefficient of friction for a given material.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elasticity refers to the suture's intrinsic ability to hold its original form and length after being stretched. This allows the suture to expand with wound edema or to retract and maintain wound edge apposition during wound contraction. Plasticity refers to a material that, when stretched, does not return to original length.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory is closely related to plasticity and elasticity. It refers to the inherent ability of a material to return to its former shape after being manipulated, and is often a reflection of its stiffness. A suture with a high level of memory is stiffer, more difficult to handle, and more susceptible to becoming untied than a suture with low memory. Polypropylene (Prolene) is a good example of a suture with a high level of memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Absorbable sutures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An absorbable suture is generally defined as one that will lose most of its tensile strength within 60 days after implantation beneath the skin surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The most commonly used today are the synthetic sutures (polyglactin 910 [Vicryl], polyglycolic acid [Dexon], polydioxanone [PDS], and polytrimethylene carbonate [Maxon]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51741\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51741 \">table 3</a>). Catgut is still used frequently in pediatric wound closures. Fast Absorbing Gut is ideal for percutaneous facial closures and Vicryl Rapide can be used for laceration repair under splints or casts.</p><p>The ideal absorbable suture has low tissue reactivity, high tensile strength, slow absorption rates, and reliable knot security. Classically, absorbable sutures were only used for deep sutures. However, many have advocated the use of absorbable sutures for percutaneous closure of wounds in adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fast-absorbing gut for percutaneous closure of some facial lacerations is reasonable, particularly if suture removal will be traumatic. Subcutaneous sutures with a synthetic absorbable suture may improve wound tension and provide support to the healing wound once the gut has dissolved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vicryl Rapide or Chromic Gut is ideal for percutaneous closure of lacerations underneath casts or splints, but is limited for facial use due to their longer absorption times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromic gut or Vicryl works well for single or layered closure of tongue or oral mucosa lacerations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vicryl or Monocryl is ideal for dermal closure of deep facial lacerations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nail bed closure is best done with chromic gut or Vicryl.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Catgut</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catgut is a natural product derived from sheep or cattle intima. Plain catgut retains significant tensile strength for only five to seven days. Chromic gut is treated with chromium salts to resist body enzymes, thus delaying absorption time. Chromic gut retains tensile strength for 10 to 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The main use of chromic gut is to close lacerations in the oral mucosa. Chromic gut is more rapidly absorbed in the oral cavity than most synthetic sutures, making it ideal for this environment. Chromic Gut is also used at our institution for skin closure on fingertip lacerations with or without concurrent nail bed injuries. It is less optimal for use in dermal (subcutaneous) and muscle layer closures because of increased tissue reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Fast-absorbing gut is a newer material not treated with chromic salts. It is heat-treated to accelerate tensile strength loss and absorption. It is used primarily for epidermal suturing, where sutures are only required for five to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The use of this fast-absorbing suture was studied in 654 wounds during plastic surgery procedures. The suture was adequately dissolved in the majority of cases during follow-up visits at four to six days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Fast-absorbing gut is ideal for suturing facial lacerations when tissue adhesives cannot be used or suture removal will be difficult. However, care must be taken to be gentle with tying knots when using the smaller (6-0) fast-absorbing gut, due to its low tensile strength. It is reasonable to reinforce this suture with skin tapes. The use of 5-0 fast absorbing gut is reasonable for facial closures due to improved tensile strength.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Polyglactin 910 (Vicryl)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vicryl is a lubricated, braided synthetic material with excellent handling and smooth tie-down properties. It retains significant tensile strength for three to four weeks. Complete absorption occurs in 60 to 90 days. It has decreased tissue reactivity compared with catgut as well as improved tensile strength and knot strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Vicryl is an ideal choice for subcutaneous sutures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H803483\"><span class=\"h4\">Vicryl Rapide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vicryl Rapide has properties similar to fast-absorbing gut. It is the fastest absorbing synthetic suture and is indicated only for use in superficial soft tissue approximation of the skin and mucosa. All of its tensile strength is lost by 10 to 14 days, and the suture begins to &quot;fall off&quot; in 7 to 10 days as the wound heals. It is ideal for skin closure in patients in whom suture removal would be difficult or for closure of lacerations under casts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The longer absorption time may limit its usefulness in some facial closures.</p><p>Vicryl Rapide has been proposed as an alternative to nonabsorbable sutures for certain laceration sites. As an example, in a small trial that compared Vicryl Rapide with polypropylene sutures in 73 patients with trunk or extremity lacerations, Vicryl Rapide had similar cosmetic outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, rates of infection and train tracking (scarring perpendicular to the wound edge) were higher in patients who underwent closure with Vicryl Rapide when compared to nonabsorbable suture (infection rate 11 versus 3 percent, respectively; rate of train tracking 17 versus 8 percent, respectively) although the sample size was too small to show statistical significance for these findings. Thus, Vicryl Rapide may be associated with more complications when used for closure of trunk or extremity lacerations and further study is needed to determine if it is an appropriate suture choice for closure of these wounds. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Poliglecaprone 25 (Monocryl)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monocryl is a monofilament suture that has superior pliability for easier handling and tying of knots. Its monofilament quality gives it a theoretical advantage over braided sutures for contaminated wounds requiring deep sutures. This suture is often used by plastic surgeons at our institution for facial lacerations closed with subcuticular running sutures. All of its tensile strength is lost by 21 days postimplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Polyglycolic acid (Dexon)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polyglycolic acid was the first synthetic absorbable suture to become available. It is a braided polymer, is less reactive than gut sutures, and has excellent knot security. It maintains at least 50 percent of its tensile strength for 25 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The main drawback is a high friction coefficient causing &quot;binding and snagging&quot; when wet. Newer forms of this suture have been developed, Dexon Plus and Dexon II, which have an added synthetic coating to improve handling properties while maintaining knot security [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Polydioxanone (PDS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PDS is a synthetic monofilament polymer marketed as having improved tensile strength compared with Vicryl. It retains the majority of its tensile strength at five to six weeks. Because it is a monofilament, it has the theoretical advantage of creating a lower potential for infection. In addition, it appears to have a lower friction coefficient and better knot security than Vicryl [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A disadvantage of using PDS is that it is more difficult to use than the braided synthetics because of intrinsic stiffness. In addition, it costs about 14 percent more than either Dexon or Vicryl [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Polytrimethylene carbonate (Maxon)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maxon is a synthetic monofilament. It was developed to combine the excellent tensile strength of PDS with improved handling properties. The majority of its tensile strength is present at five to six weeks. It has minimal tissue reactivity, excellent first-throw holding capacity, and smoother knot tie-down than Vicryl. The only disadvantage is the approximate 7 percent increased cost compared with Vicryl or Dexon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonabsorbable sutures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knot security, tensile strength, tissue reactivity, and workability of the various nonabsorbable sutures used for skin closure are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63622 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Silk </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Silk is a natural product that is renowned for its ease to handle and tie. It has the lowest tensile strength of any nonabsorbable suture. It is rarely used for suturing of minor wounds because stronger synthetic materials are now available.

Its main disadvantage is prominent memory that requires an increased number of knot throws (three to four) to hold a suture in place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polypropylene (Surgilene, Prolene) </strong>&ndash; Polypropylene is a plastic, synthetic suture that has low tissue reactivity and high tensile strength similar to nylon. It is slippery and requires extra throws to secure the knot (four to five). Prolene is especially noted for its plasticity, allowing the suture to stretch to accommodate wound swelling. When wound swelling recedes, the suture will remain loose. The cost of Prolene is approximately 13 percent more than nylon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Prolene can be purchased in a blue color, which can be advantageous in localizing sutures in the scalp and dark-skinned individuals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Polybutester (Novafil)</strong> &ndash; Polybutester suture is composed of a monofilament synthetic copolymer with tensile strength and healing properties similar to nylon and polypropylene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Polybutester also handles well but has greater elasticity than either nylon or polypropylene. Its use may be associated with decreased potential for suture marks because of its ability to expand if wound edema occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469254557\"><span class=\"h1\">SUTURE SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a metaanalysis of 19 trials (1748 patients) comparing the efficacy of nonabsorbable sutures with absorbable sutures for skin closure of surgical and traumatic lacerations, absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures had equivalent cosmetic outcomes and no significant difference for wound infection or wound dehiscence although follow-up was insufficient in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The two most prominent manufacturers of suture, Ethicon and Davis and Geck, use different nomenclature for their needles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The basic anatomy of a needle remains the same, however:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The eye is the end of the needle attached to the suture. All sutures used for acute wound repair are swaged (ie, the needle and suture are connected as a continuous unit).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The body of the needle is the portion that is grasped by the needle holder during the procedure. The body determines the shape of the needle and is curved for cutaneous suturing. The curvature may be one-fourth, three-eighths, one-half, or five-eighths circle. The most commonly used curvature is the three-eighths circle, requiring only minimal pronation of the wrist for large and superficial wounds. The one-half and five-eighths circles were devised for suturing in confined spaces, such as the oral cavity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The point of the needle extends from the extreme tip to the maximum cross section of body. For soft tissue and fascia, the taper needle, round in cross section, is ideal.</p><p/><p>Needle points are also available in cutting, conventional cutting, or reverse cutting form: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutting &ndash; Cutting needles have at least two opposing cutting edges. Cutting needles are ideal for skin sutures that must pass through dense, irregular, and relatively thick dermal connective tissue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional cutting &ndash; Conventional cutting needles have a third cutting edge on the inside concave curvature of the needle. This needle type may be prone to cutout of tissue because the inside cutting edge cuts toward the edges of the incision or wound. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reverse cutting &ndash; Reverse cutting needles have a third cutting edge located on the outer convex curvature of the needle, which theoretically reduces the danger of tissue cutout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Reverse cutting needles should be used for thick skin like the palm and soles.</p><p/><p>Standard skin needles (FS series, CE series) are suitable for the scalp, trunk, and extremities.

In general, sutures are placed just far enough from each other so that no gap appears in the wound edges. A useful guideline is that the distance between sutures is equal to the bite distance from the wound edge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermal closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermal closure is typically used when wounds are deep such that closing the cutaneous layer will leave significant dead space with the potential for hematoma or abscess formation or when the wound is gaping and approximation of the dermis permits less tension at the skin level. The dermal or buried suture approximates the dermis just below the dermal-epidermal junction, thereby improving the cosmetic result in both situations.</p><p>Absorbable suture material must be used for dermal or buried sutures. The knot should be buried away from the skin surface of the wound so that it will not interfere with epidermal healing. This can be accomplished by inverting the suture loop using the following technique (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75042\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75042 \">figure 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The needle should be inserted in the dermis and directed toward the skin surface, exiting near the dermal-epidermal junction on the same side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The needle should then be inserted on the opposite side of the wound near the dermal-epidermal junction, directly across from the point of exit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The suture loop should be completed in the dermis, directly opposite the origin of the loop, and the knot tied.</p><p/><p>Dermal sutures do not increase the risk of infection in clean, uncontaminated lacerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, animal studies suggest that deep sutures should be avoided in highly contaminated wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There should be no more than three knots per suture and the fewest number of sutures possible should be placed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternative suture techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Running suture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A running suture is used for rapid percutaneous closure of longer wounds. It provides even distribution of tension along the length of the wound, preventing excess tightness in any one area. This technique is best reserved for wounds at low risk of infection with edges that align easily.</p><p>The closure is started with the standard technique of a percutaneous simple interrupted suture, but the suture is not cut after the initial knot is tied. The needle is then used to make repeated bites, starting at the original knot by making each new bite through the skin at an angle of 45 degrees to the wound direction. The cross stays on the surface of the skin will be at an angle of 90 degrees to the wound direction. The final bite is made at an angle of 90 degrees to the wound direction to bring the suture out next to the previous bite. The final bite is left in a loose loop, which acts as a free end for tying the knot. A disadvantage to this suture is if the stitch breaks or if the physician wants to remove only a few sutures at a time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Subcuticular running suture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The subcuticular running suture is often used by plastic surgeons to close straight lacerations on the face. An absorbable suture, such as Monocryl or Vicryl, is used. The suture is anchored at one end of the laceration and then a plane is chosen in the dermis or just deep to the dermis in the superficial subcutaneous fascia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71747\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71747 \">figure 4</a>). Mirror image bites are taken horizontally in this plane for the full length of the laceration. The final bite leaves a trailing loop of suture so a final knot can be tied. The wound is then reinforced with adhesive tape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Vertical mattress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vertical mattress suture is recommended for wounds under tension and for those with edges that tend to invert (fall or fold into the wound) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. It acts as a deep and superficial closure all in one suture. The first portion of the suture loop (far-far) approximates the dermal structures. The second portion (near-near) closes the wound and everts the edges.</p><p>A vertical mattress suture is traditionally placed using the following technique (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69848\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69848 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The needle is initially inserted at a distance from the wound edge, crossing through the dermal tissue and exiting through the skin on the opposite side at an equal distance from the wound edge.

This near-near portion of the suture loop closes and everts the edges of the wound.</p><p/><p>Alternatively, in the shorthand vertical mattress technique, the small backhand bites at the wound edges are completed first, followed by the deeper, wider forehand bites. In one trial that compared repair time and wound healing for patients randomized to receive either the traditional or the shorthand technique, wounds were repaired in one-half the time using the shorthand technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The needle is introduced into the skin in the usual manner and brought out on the opposite side of the wound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F116784\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116784 \">figure 6</a>). A second bite is taken along the opposite side, approximately 0.5 cm from the first exit site, and is brought back to the original starting side, also 0.5 cm from the initial entry point.</p><p>The half-buried horizontal mattress suture combines elements of the horizontal mattress suture with a dermal closure. It can be used to approximate the corner of a flap (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51901\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51901 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The needle is introduced through the skin in the portion of the wound that does <strong>not</strong> include the flap. In the dermal (or buried) portion of the suture, the corner of the flap is picked up horizontally through the dermis. The suture loop is completed by bringing the needle out through the skin on the opposite side of the nonflap portion.

It is inevitable that the clinician will encounter some parents who demand a plastic surgeon for simple laceration repairs or sedation for a laceration that easily could be managed with patient distraction and topical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> injectable anesthetics. The best approach is to listen first and to suggest reasonable alternatives later. In some instances, there is no choice but to call a plastic surgeon. At other times, parents will listen to the explanation that the cosmetic outcome will be no different if repaired by a surgeon in the case of a simple, clean laceration. At times, it is also an issue of plastic surgeon availability. Often their viewpoint changes when the parents are truthfully told that it will be two to three hours before a surgeon can see their child.</p><p>In cases where a parent demands sedation for a simple laceration, he or she must understand that sedation has risks that are unnecessary if a reasonable and safe alternative exists. The use of distraction methods and the use of topical anesthetics should also be explained to the parent. Child life specialists, if available, can provide invaluable assistance in this scenario. The child life specialist can adequately distract many patients by reading books with the patient, playing a video, or providing visual imagery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h2\">Anxious and uncooperative patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anxious and uncooperative patient is a challenge that at times can be managed with similar methods of distraction and imagery, but at other times leaves no choice but to sedate the patient to repair the laceration. Sedation choices vary depending upon age, mechanism of injury, and time required for repair and are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H2253115\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of medications for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Minimally painful procedures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

(See <a href=\"#H31004258\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sutures are appropriate when the depth of the wound will lead to excessive scarring if the wound edges are not properly apposed. Concern about wound infection is the main reason not to close a wound primarily. (See <a href=\"#H31004258\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H31004266\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of tissue adhesives and staples for closure of minor wounds, including indications and contraindications, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-repair-with-tissue-adhesives-cyanoacrylates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound repair with tissue adhesives (cyanoacrylates)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-staples\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closure of minor skin wounds with staples&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound irrigation, foreign body removal, and necrotic tissue debridement are the main preventative measures against tissue infection. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Wound preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previously, absorbable sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51741\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51741 \">table 3</a>) were used only for deep sutures. However, absorbable sutures are now advocated in some adult and pediatric patients for percutaneous closure of wounds as an alternative to nonabsorbable sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63622 \">table 4</a>). In particular, fast-absorbing gut is ideal for skin closure of facial lacerations in patients in whom suture removal would be difficult or tissue adhesives are not an option. Chromic gut or Vicryl are recommended to close lacerations in the oral mucosa, and Vicryl Rapide or Chromic Gut is ideal for closure of lacerations under casts or splints. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Suture materials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutting needles are ideal for skin sutures that must pass through dense, irregular, and relatively thick dermal connective tissue. Standard skin needles (FS series, CE series) are suitable for the scalp, trunk, and extremities. Finer sutures on the face require a smaller and more sharply honed needle (P, PS, PC, and PRE series). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Needles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The simple interrupted suture is the standard technique used for the closure of most uncomplicated wounds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60681\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60681 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74454\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74454 \">figure 2</a>). A running suture is used for rapid percutaneous closure of longer wounds. It is best reserved for wounds at low risk of infection with edges that align easily. The vertical mattress suture is appropriate for wounds under tension and for wounds with edges that tend to fall or fold into the wound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69848\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69848 \">figure 5</a>). A horizontal mattress suture can also be used to achieve wound eversion in areas of high skin tension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F116784\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116784 \">figure 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Suturing techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most wounds should be covered with an antibiotic ointment and a nonadhesive dressing immediately after laceration repair. The dressing should be left in place for 24 hours, after which time most wounds can be left open to the air. (See <a href=\"#H37\" class=\"local\">'Dressing and bathing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that healthy patients with minor wounds, other than bite wounds, who undergo laceration repair with sutures <strong>not</strong> be prescribed prophylactic antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The timing of suture removal varies with the anatomic site. (See <a href=\"#H39\" class=\"local\">'Suture removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Separate topics discuss the assessment and management of minor wound closure of the scalp, face, and mouth in greater detail.
