Derived from the Greek words kakos, meaning &ldquo;bad things,&rdquo; and hexus, meaning &ldquo;state of being,&rdquo; the term cachexia has been used to describe weight loss. From an, meaning &ldquo;without,&rdquo; and orexis, meaning &ldquo;appetite, desire,&rdquo; the word anorexia is used to characterize loss of appetite. Cachexia, a hypercatabolic state that is defined by an accelerated loss of skeletal muscle in the context of a chronic inflammatory response, is best described in the setting of cancer but is also seen in other advanced chronic illnesses including AIDS, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although body composition changes are not identical in all of these disease states, the term cachexia is used in all of these settings.</p><p>Loss of appetite and weight loss are common among patients with an advanced serious life-threatening illness such as cancer. However, the profound weight loss suffered by patients with cachexia cannot be entirely attributed to poor caloric intake. In contrast to simple starvation, which is characterized by a caloric deficiency that can be reversed with appropriate feeding, cachexia is not reversed by the supplementation of calories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic review will cover the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of anorexia and cachexia in palliative care patients. A more detailed review of the clinical features, pathogenesis, and management of cancer-associated anorexia and cachexia is available elsewhere.

However, the measurement of body weight may underestimate the frequency of cachexia in patients who are <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obese</span> or who have gained weight because of edema or a growing tumor mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>This has led to efforts to expand the definition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2007, an international expert panel agreed to the following formal definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]: &ldquo;Cachexia, is a complex metabolic syndrome associated with underlying illness and characterized by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. The prominent clinical feature of cachexia is weight loss in adults (corrected for fluid retention) or growth failure in children (excluding endocrine disorders). Anorexia, inflammation, insulin resistance, and increased muscle protein breakdown are frequently associated with cachexia. Cachexia is distinct from starvation, age-related loss of muscle mass, primary depression, and malabsorption, and is associated with increased morbidity.&rdquo;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common findings in cachectic patients include anorexia or reduced nutritional intake, systemic inflammation, decreased muscle bulk (sarcopenia) and strength, and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. Taking all of these factors into consideration, one proposed generic definition for <span class=\"nowrap\">cachexia/wasting</span> includes weight loss with or without fat loss and, as additional criteria (three required for diagnosis), decreased muscle strength, reduced muscle mass, fatigue, anorexia, or biochemical alterations (anemia, inflammation, low albumin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An international group of researchers has developed a definition and three-level staging system for cachexia in cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], which needs further validation, particularly in patients with disease other than cancer. Preliminary studies in advanced non-small cell lung or gastrointestinal cancers have suggested clinical relevance for these cancer cachexia stages with respect to overall symptom burden, quality of life, tolerability for chemotherapy, body composition, and survival; however, patients in the precachectic and cachectic groups behaved in a similar manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H527426901\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and clinical significance'</a> below.)</p><p>Cachexia is distinct from sarcopenia, which is defined by loss of skeletal muscle mass to an amount that is two standard deviations below sex-specific normal values for young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Unlike cachexia, sarcopenia does not require the presence of weight loss. Whereas most people with cachexia are sarcopenic, most sarcopenic individuals are not considered cachectic. Muscle loss without the loss or gain in fat is known as sarcopenic obesity, which is prevalent in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] and is also noted in advanced cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The causes of sarcopenia are multifactorial and can include disuse, changing endocrine function, chronic diseases, inflammation, insulin resistance, nutritional deficiencies, some forms of cancer treatment, notably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> and androgen deprivation therapy, and specific cancers, notably non-small cell lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

In a second report of 2382 inpatient palliative care consultations, adults 65 to 84 were significantly more likely to report anorexia than were younger adults (odds ratio 1.57, 95% CI 1.23-2.00) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>While very common in patients with advanced cancer, anorexia is also common in other chronic diseases, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anorexia affects 30 to 40 percent of adult patients on maintenance hemodialysis and is associated with increased rates of hospitalization, poor quality of life, and increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H22882391\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>The prevalence of cachexia also varies according to disease. Prevalence ranges from 5 to 20 percent in chronic heart failure to 60 percent in COPD, and is as high as 85 percent in advanced cancer, particularly certain types, such as pancreatic, gastric, and lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. </p><p>Cachexia is also highly prevalent in moderate to advanced stages of CKD. Loss of weight affects between 18 to 75 percent of patients with CK, and the prevalence depends in part on patient characteristics (eg, requirement for maintenance hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]) and the presence of comorbid conditions such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, or liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In the setting of CKD, the term protein-energy wasting (PEW) is used to define earlier stages of a wasting syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM) suggests that the term cachexia be reserved for only the most severe forms of PEW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This distinction is important because nutritional supplementation may be helpful in patients with PEW to reverse the progression to cachexia in adult patients with end-stage renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H22882594\" class=\"local\">'Chronic kidney disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The incidence of cachexia in patients infected with HIV has decreased with the introduction of effective antiviral therapy. However, in the United States, despite effective antiviral therapy, the prevalence of cachexia in HIV-infected patients is roughly 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In non-developed countries where access to expensive antiviral medications is limited, weight loss is more prevalent.

A prospective study of patients with advanced cancer found that patients who experienced weight loss of at least 10 percent during the previous six months reported higher deterioration of body image than did patients without such weight loss, and body image dissatisfaction had a strong association with psychosocial outcomes (anxiety, depression, decreased sexual interest and enjoyment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a qualitative study, family caregivers universally noted changes in oral intake at the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Bereaved caregivers who were interviewed reported a sense of helplessness and guilt associated with a loved one losing weight, and felt that not enough education and psychological support was provided by health care providers regarding hydration and nutrition at the end of life. Some caregivers accepted decreased intake as part of the dying process, while others preferred to support oral intake in their &ldquo;battle&rdquo; against illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Cachexia is also associated with a poor prognosis in patients with advanced disease. In a National Hospice study of terminal cancer, the symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, xerostomia, and dysphagia were all predictive of decreased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition to cancer, cachexia in the setting of other illnesses, such as heart failure, CKD, HIV disease, or COPD, has also been shown to increase the risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>].

Nutritional intake is coordinated by the brain, primarily in the hypothalamic nuclei, which integrates signals from cognitive, visual, and sensory stimuli as well as activity of the gastrointestinal tract. A host of signaling molecules in the brain exert stimulating or inhibiting control of appetite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>], including neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, histamine), hormones such as ghrelin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>] and leptin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>], corticotropin-releasing factor, neuropeptide Y, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F90040\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90040 \">table 1</a>). The cellular signals that regulate intake of nutrition are not well understood. </p><p>Lack of appetite is frequently seen in patients with many kinds of advanced illness (eg, heart failure, cancer, chronic kidney disease [CKD], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). In fact, a chronic illness affecting any organ system can cause anorexia and weight loss. The symptom of anorexia in the setting of infection, trauma, or cancer may represent an important adaptive response that allows an organism to mobilize energy reserves in order to sustain the increased metabolism required to wage an immune response and heal injuries, or repair the destruction from rapidly dividing malignant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>Lack of appetite can also be a consequence of chronic fatigue or nausea, which may be barely noticeable; altered taste, depression, pain, xerostomia, disorders of gastrointestinal motility, including gastroparesis, and constipation can also contribute. These symptoms are referred to as &ldquo;secondary nutrition impact symptoms.&rdquo; (See <a href=\"#H345696568\" class=\"local\">'Secondary nutrition impact symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Other common considerations include medications (amphetamines, antibiotics, opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], antihistamines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranolazine</a>), depression, and food aversions. At least in the setting of end-stage renal disease, male patients tend to have increased symptoms of anorexia, suggesting a possible role for sex hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>Aging may also contribute. Food intake gradually diminishes with age, much of which is an appropriate response to decreased energy needs due to reduced physical activity and decreased resting energy expenditure. Changes in taste and smell can also lead to a decreased desire to eat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Purported benefits for tube feeding in diseases such as advanced dementia include prolonging life, preventing aspiration, improving malnutrition and its sequelae (ie, pressure sores), and alleviating symptoms of hunger or thirst. However, a systematic review in 2009, which included seven observational studies, found that the available evidence failed to demonstrate that enteral tube feeding achieved any of these outcomes in patients with advanced dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-assessment-and-management-of-anorexia-and-cachexia/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>]. It is important to note, however, that there have been no randomized trials of tube feeding versus continued oral feeding in advanced dementia, and intervention with a PEG tube may be considered in selected patients. Maintaining or improving a patient&rsquo;s QOL, even in the short-term, reducing pain and suffering, and providing access for hydration or medication delivery may be reasonable goals of PEG tube placement, even in patients with ultimately terminal diseases.</p><p/><p>These issues, as well as issues surrounding discontinuation of artificial nutrition and hydration near the end of life, are all discussed in detail elsewhere.

The incidence of wasting has declined since the introduction of effective ART. Tissue wasting responds rapidly to ART. When possible, the primary therapy of HIV wasting is treatment of the underlying HIV infection with ART.

Anorexia is defined as either loss of appetite or reduced caloric intake. Cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome that is defined by a continuous loss of skeletal muscle mass, with or without loss of fat mass, that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support. While loss of appetite (anorexia) with weight loss can contribute to cachexia, the profound weight loss suffered by patients with cachexia cannot be entirely attributed to poor caloric intake. (See <a href=\"#H22882391\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a high prevalence of anorexia-cachexia syndrome in patients with advanced cancer, but it also can occur in the setting of other chronic illnesses including advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS,</span> heart failure, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). (See <a href=\"#H527426901\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and clinical significance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of appetite is common in patients with advanced illness. Contributory factors include chronic fatigue or nausea, altered taste, depression, pain, xerostomia, disorders of gastrointestinal motility, constipation, medications, and aging. (See <a href=\"#H345696568\" class=\"local\">'Secondary nutrition impact symptoms'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large number of observations point towards cytokines as the molecules responsible for some of the metabolic derangements associated with the hypermetabolic state that characterizes cancer-bearing states, and the inflammatory response may play a unifying central role in the cachexia that occurs with injury, infection, and chronic illness other than cancer. However, the etiology of cachexia appears to be more complex and multifactorial than just inflammation alone. As an example, in patients with cancer cachexia, studies suggest a potentially important role for several tumor-derived and potentially cachexia-inducing substances, the target of which appears to be skeletal muscle gene products. Hypogonadism is another potential cause of tissue wasting in men; an important cause is chronic opioid use. (See <a href=\"#H22882412\" class=\"local\">'Cachexia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All palliative care patients should be screened for nutritional status and weight loss. The clinical assessment for patients with anorexia or cachexia includes a careful history that is focused on nutritional issues, including risk factors that compromise the ability to obtain or take in nutrition, and a physical examination focusing on loss of subcutaneous fat, muscle wasting (temporal region, deltoids and quadriceps with loss of bulk and tone by palpation), edema (sacral or ankle), or ascites. The most commonly used objective measures of nutritional status are serial measurement of body weight and assessment of dietary intake, while subjective information on nutritional status can be provided by malnutrition assessment tools. No screening tool has been universally agreed upon to detect malnutrition in cancer patients or in those with other chronic illnesses. (See <a href=\"#H22882419\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most hypogonadal men, the benefits of testosterone replacement are very small. We do not routinely screen men with cancer cachexia for low testosterone except in those patients for whom there is a clinical trial available to evaluate the benefits of testosterone replacement. We screen all cancer patients with weight loss for thyroid abnormalities, which are more common in patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target the vascular endothelial growth factor. We also screen for adrenal insufficiency in cancer patients who have bilateral adrenal metastasis or in those with a clinical suspicion for adrenal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H345696618\" class=\"local\">'Other contributors to anorexia and cachexia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nutrition consult should be considered for patients with anorexia-cachexia syndrome. In general, patients with anorexia-cachexia syndrome who are able to eat should be recommended to have small, frequent meals that are dense in calories. While some patients may benefit from nutritional supplementation, patients and families should be counseled that increasing caloric intake does not reverse the underlying process and that anorexia and cachexia are not uncommon symptoms but a natural process that occurs at the end of life. Optimizing management of major contributors to anorexia, such as chronic nausea, constipation, taste alterations, dyspnea, and depression, may result in significant improvement. (See <a href=\"#H20096256\" class=\"local\">'General aspects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with persistent anorexia, pharmacologic treatments are available that predominantly stimulate appetite; however, they will not reverse cachexia in most patients. For patients with anorexia related to cancer, <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS,</span> or other underlying pathology (but not end-stage renal disease), we suggest a short trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). However, the benefits of therapy (appetite stimulation, modest weight gain) must be balanced against the risk of edema, the risk of thromboembolic phenomena, and an increased risk of death. If patients elect to pursue treatment, a two-week trial of megestrol to assess for improvement in appetite may be considered, and if ineffective, discontinue. To minimize adverse effects, it is recommended to start at the lowest effective dose (starting at 160 mg daily) and titrate to a maximum of 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. (See <a href=\"#H22882493\" class=\"local\">'Megestrol acetate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoids stimulate appetite; almost all of the data are in cancer patients with anorexia-cachexia syndrome, and there is no evidence for the use of these agents in anorexia due to end-stage nonmalignant conditions. In the setting of cancer-associated anorexia-cachexia syndrome, a trial is reasonable for patients with a poor short-term prognosis (life expectancy less than six to eight weeks) because of the unfavorable long-term side effect profile of glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H22882500\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not using synthetic cannabinoids, either as a single agent or in combination with megestrol, for most patients with anorexia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cachexia. We also suggest not using inhaled marijuana for anorexia and cachexia given the lack of evidence supporting benefit. (See <a href=\"#H22559713\" class=\"local\">'Cannabinoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testosterone supplementation may be beneficial for hypogonadal men who have advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> or are receiving long-term opioid therapy. The benefits of testosterone replacement in hypogonadal men with other advanced serious illness, at least in the setting of advanced cancer, remain uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H20094022\" class=\"local\">'Anabolic steroids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with pulmonary cachexia syndrome who are unable to increase their weight with nutritional supplementation and exercise, a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxandrolone</a> is reasonable.
