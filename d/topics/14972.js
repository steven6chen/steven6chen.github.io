In the following topic review, the term renal agenesis will be used to refer to absent kidneys resulting from either of these etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80784\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80784 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Renal agenesis may be either unilateral or bilateral. Bilateral renal agenesis is incompatible with extrauterine life because prolonged absence of amniotic fluid results in pulmonary hypoplasia leading to severe respiratory insufficiency at birth. The longest-surviving child lived 39 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, in a single case of bilateral renal agenesis managed in utero with serial amnioinfusion, survival at nine months was reported at the time of the publication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the widespread use of prenatal ultrasonography and availability of legalized pregnancy termination in the United States, the incidence of bilateral renal agenesis was about 1 in 4000 births and about 1 in 250 autopsies of stillbirths and infant deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It is 2.5 times more common in males than in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The incidence of unilateral renal agenesis is about 1 in 3000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>True renal agenesis results from a lack of induction of the metanephric blastema by the ureteral bud. Most cases represent true renal agenesis; however, some absent kidneys may be secondary to involution of multicystic dysplastic kidneys (or dysplastic kidneys) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80784\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80784 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal development of the urinary tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal urinary system develops in three stages:</p><p> &#160;(1) The pronephros, a transient nonfunctioning structure, develops from the intermediate mesoderm in the cervical region and then regresses at about four weeks embryonic age. It is replaced at about five weeks by the mesonephros, which develops from the paravertebral mesoderm of the upper thoracic to lumbar region and is also not functional (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53054\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53054 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p> &#160;(2) The mesonephros disappears by the end of the second month of gestation. The few remaining caudal tubules adjacent to the testis and ovaries develop into the vas deferens in males and remnant tissue in females.</p><p> &#160;(3) The ureteric bud is an outgrowth of the dorsomedial wall of the mesonephric duct. The ureteric bud invades a cord of mesenchymal cells called the metanephric blastema at 5 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68255\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68255 \">figure 3</a>). Invasion of the metanephric blastema by the ureteric bud leads to the formation of the definitive kidney. While growing into the metanephric blastema, the ureteric bud forms the major and minor caliceal system of the renal pelvis and collecting ducts of the kidney. The advancing ureteric bud induces the mesenchymal cells of the metanephric blastema to differentiate into the epithelial cells to form the glomeruli and renal tubules. Foci of the metanephric blastema become condensed adjacent to the branching ureteric bud to form comma-shaped bodies that then elongate to form S-shaped bodies. The lower portion of the S-shaped body becomes associated with a tuft of capillaries to form the glomerulus, while the upper portion forms the tubular elements of the nephron&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80344\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80344 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>The development of a connection between the nephrons and the collecting system marks the beginning of the functioning renal unit. This metanephric tissue, called the metanephros, forms the permanent kidney. It contains glomeruli and tubules that begin to function at 6 to 10 weeks of gestation and begin to produce urine at approximately 11 weeks. The definitive kidney then migrates from its caudal position to its permanent location in the lumbar region.</p><p>The bladder develops from a separate, but contiguous, structure termed the urogenital sinus. The bladder is present in fetuses with renal agenesis, but is empty since no urine is produced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal development of the urinary tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal agenesis (and many other renal malformations) occur when the ureteric bud fails to develop and thus fails to induce differentiation of the metanephrogenic mesenchyme to renal tubular epithelium. In vitro models reveal that when the ureteric bud and metanephrogenic mesenchyme meet, the ureteric bud branches and nephrons form within three to seven days of culture; however, if they remain apart, nephrons do not form and the mesenchymal tissue undergoes apoptosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral renal agenesis has been associated with preexisting diabetes, a prepregnancy maternal body mass index greater than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 3.67), smoking during the periconceptional period (aOR = 2.09, 95% CI: 1.08, 4.03), and binge drinking during the second month of pregnancy (aOR = 3.64, 95% CI: 1.19, 11.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SONOGRAPHIC EVALUATION OF THE FETAL URINARY TRACT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A systematic approach to evaluating the fetal kidneys, adrenals, bladder, and amniotic fluid volume is of utmost importance in making a correct diagnosis of renal agenesis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H848692708\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal kidneys and adrenal glands</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetal kidneys are relatively hyperechoic in the first trimester and can be visualized at both sides of the lumbar spine starting at 10 to 12 weeks. Transverse and coronal views can be used for assessing their presence; the addition of color Doppler flow on the coronal view is useful for visualization of the renal arteries. A small amount of fluid in the renal pelvis is physiologic and is helpful in identifying the renal tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77510\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77510 \">image 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64756\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64756 \">image 1B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75147\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75147 \">image 2A</a>). &#160;</p><p>Starting at 20 weeks, identification of the fetal kidneys requires stricter criteria than mere presence of tissue or a mass in the area of the renal fossa. Renal medulla and cortex can be well-differentiated by the 20<sup>th</sup> to 25<sup>th</sup> week of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Thus, presence of a kidney should be based upon visualization of an echogenic reniform mass containing hypoechoic medullary pyramids circumferentially arranged beneath the renal cortical tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77510%7EOBGYN%2F64756%7EOBGYN%2F69784%7EOBGYN%2F77621\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77510 graphicRef64756 graphicRef69784 graphicRef77621 \">image 1A-D</a>). The renal arteries can normally be seen on coronal views to exit from either side of the aorta, cranial to its bifurcation into the common iliac vessels. Pattern recognition of the renal artery and vein waveforms using pulsed Doppler should enable the observer to distinguish these vessels from other abdominal vessels.</p><p>Fetal adrenal glands can be consistently visualized at 11 to 13 weeks using transabdominal and transvaginal imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The adrenal glands lie superior and medial to the kidney. The gland has an inverted &quot;V&quot; shape on longitudinal views and has an oval shape on transverse views. The ultrasound appearance is characterized by an echogenic central stripe representing the medulla and surrounding peripheral sonolucent rim representing the cortex. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1544715386\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal bladder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bladder can be visualized as early as 10 weeks of gestation. In one study, the bladder was always visualized when the crown rump length (CRL) was more than 67 mm, and in 91 percent of cases when the CRL was 38 to 67 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The use of both transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound enables bladder visualization in 98 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Urine production starts at 9 weeks of gestation and increases significantly after 16 weeks. Fetal urine production is estimated to be around 7.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> at 24 weeks of gestation, increasing to 71.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> near term or approximately 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> fetal <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Filling and emptying of the fetal bladder occurs approximately every 30 to 60 minutes. Therefore, the bladder should be observed for accumulation of urine over one hour before concluding that urine is not being produced. It had been common practice to administer intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> to the mother to stimulate fetal diuresis and bladder filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This practice has largely been abandoned since absence of bladder filling after furosemide does not prove absence of normal functional kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Color flow Doppler imaging of the pelvic umbilical arteries can be useful for demarcating the location of the bladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78040\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78040 \">image 3</a>).</p><p>Retrograde filling of the bladder, such as in urogenital sinus anomalies, and midline urachal cysts may be misdiagnosed as normal renal urine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2176057311\"><span class=\"h2\">Amniotic fluid volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major nonspecific marker of bilateral renal agenesis is severely reduced or absent amniotic fluid. In early pregnancy, the movement of fluid across the amnion, fetal membranes, and chorionic plate is thought to be the dominant source of amniotic fluid. Fetal urine becomes the main source after about 16 weeks of gestation. Therefore, amniotic fluid volume in pregnancies complicated by renal agenesis might appear normal in early pregnancy (before 16 weeks), even though sharply reduced or absent amniotic fluid volume is the most prominent ultrasonic feature of this disorder by the midtrimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of amniotic fluid volume regulation&quot;</a>). The absence of fluid is not pathognomonic of bilateral renal agenesis; it can also be associated with severe intrauterine growth restriction, fetal demise, urinary outflow obstruction, and premature rupture of membranes. Unilateral renal agenesis is associated with a normal volume of amniotic fluid unless the contralateral kidney is abnormal with complete obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4055869814\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS OF RENAL AGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1159652880\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prenatal diagnosis of bilateral renal agenesis is based upon sonographic nonvisualization of the fetal kidneys, ureters, and bladder, accompanied by oligohydramnios (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58911\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58911 \">image 4</a>). In two studies, the prenatal detection rate for bilateral renal <span class=\"nowrap\">agenesis/dysgenesis</span> by ultrasound was reported to be 84 and 91 percent; the detection rate for unilateral renal agenesis was 59 and 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p>Unilateral renal agenesis is more difficult to diagnose and depends upon accurately excluding the presence of a second kidney in the renal fossa or an ectopic location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54132\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54132 \">image 5</a>). </p><p>An empty renal fossa warrants a detailed search for an ectopic kidney location or a dysplastic kidney. In one study, for example, renal agenesis accounted for only 42 percent of empty renal fossae; 47 percent of the cases had an ectopic kidney in the pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73564\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73564 \">image 6</a>) or, less commonly, fused to the contralateral kidney and even in the thorax secondary to a diaphragmatic hernia (however, the kidney can be located in the thorax without evidence of a diaphragmatic hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The remaining 10 percent originally thought to be absent were subsequently located, with the majority being dysplastic. </p><p>In unilateral renal agenesis, compensatory enlargement, usually defined as renal length &gt;95<sup>th</sup> percentile for gestational age, occurs in all cases and can be seen on ultrasound starting at 20 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, an enlarged kidney contralateral to an empty renal fossa supports the diagnosis of unilateral renal agenesis or in utero dysplasia of the other kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In one study, the compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney was defined as anteroposterior to transverse diameter more than 0.9; this cut-off differentiated all cases of true renal agenesis from renal ectopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. One group described a unique growth pattern of the solitary kidney, steeper during the second than the third trimester and independent of the normative data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1605459838\"><span class=\"h3\">Color flow Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Color flow Doppler imaging of the renal arteries should be performed when the kidneys are not visualized. Failure to image renal vessels with color flow Doppler using appropriately low gain settings is suggestive, although not definitive evidence, of renal agenesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75147%7EOBGYN%2F73646\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75147 graphicRef73646 \">image 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. By comparison, color flow Doppler demonstration of renal vessels confirmed by waveform analysis verifies the presence of renal tissue. In a study that correlated prenatal color imaging with postnatal evaluation, absent renal blood flow was noted in seven of eight fetuses with bilateral renal agenesis and in one of eight fetuses with unilateral agenesis with contralateral atrophic multicystic kidney on postmortem examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Three fetuses had only one renal artery imaged; two of these had unilateral agenesis and one had a multicystic dysplastic kidney on postnatal evaluation. The presence of both kidneys was confirmed postnatally in all 22 fetuses in whom both renal arteries were identified prenatally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3406394627\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenal gland findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adrenal gland or bowel may fill in the empty renal fossa and mimic renal tissue if appropriate care is not taken in cases with renal agenesis or renal ectopy. The adrenal gland appears flattened on parasagittal images and moves laterally and inferiorly with the central hyperechoic layer sandwiched between two hypoechoic areas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69784\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69784 \">image 1C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77621\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77621 \">image 1D</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77040\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77040 \">image 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. An autopsy study found this adrenal flattening in 4 of 11 cases of bilateral renal agenesis, with no evidence of adrenal hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2095359310\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cycling fetal bladder is the best indicator of fetal urine production. Nonvisualization of the fetal bladder combined with oligohydramnios indicates severe pathology. In one series of 29 pregnancies with a nonvisualized fetal bladder at 16 to 24 weeks of gestation, the following severe anatomic malformations were present: bilateral renal agenesis (11), bilateral multicystic dysplastic kidneys (9), bilateral polycystic kidneys (3), unilateral absent kidney with unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney (3), and normal kidneys, but ectopic ureters and cone-shaped bladder (1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Although the remaining two infants had anatomically normal urinary tracts at autopsy, one had Turner syndrome with cystic hygroma and the other had severe intrauterine growth restriction, entities that can be associated with a functional derangement of the urinary system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of amnioinfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absence of amniotic fluid sharply diminishes the sonographer's ability to examine the presence and structure of the fetal kidneys. Impaired visualization is further exacerbated by crowding of the fetal extremities adjacent to the torso. Poor visualization of fetal anatomy due to absence of amniotic fluid is the main obstacle to accurate diagnosis of bilateral renal agenesis. Diagnostic amnioinfusion has been used in an attempt to surmount this limitation. As an example, one study reported successful fluid replacement was possible in 95 percent of diagnostic procedures and suspected fetal anomalies were confirmed in <span class=\"nowrap\">27/30</span> patients; the diagnosis of bilateral renal agenesis was excluded in three fetuses after amnioinfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, it is not clear whether amnioinfusion improves the diagnostic accuracy for bilateral agenesis when a careful color Doppler examination of the renal artery has been performed. The procedure for amnioinfusion is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amnioinfusion#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amnioinfusion&quot;, section on 'Transabdominal approach'</a>.)</p><p>The role of amnioinfusion for management of fetal renal agenesis is unknown. As discussed above, one group reported a single case of bilateral renal agenesis managed in utero with serial amnioinfusion with survival at nine months at the time of the publication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A multidisciplinary group subsequently reviewed the ethical considerations of this intervention and guided the development of a prospective trial to evaluate amnioinfusion in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signal void in a contracted bladder on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicates an empty bladder, which is one sign of a severe renal anomaly such as renal agenesis. The contribution of this technique to diagnosis of renal agenesis remains unclear at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>True renal agenesis, severe renal hypoplasia, and cystic dysplasia with subsequent atrophy (renal dysplasia defined as a renal remnant and ureter without normal renal histology) all lead to the same clinical presentation, but distinguishing these entities can be difficult both on ultrasound examination and at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. With true agenesis, the kidney and ureter are absent with no detectable rudiment. In contrast, atrophy of a previously hypoplastic, dysplastic, or multicystic kidney leaves a rudimentary kidney and ureter. Ultrasound examination can only distinguish between renal agenesis and atrophy if serial studies are performed and the early studies show the presence of the now atrophic kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED ABNORMALITIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3480564287\"><span class=\"h2\">Structural and genetic abnormalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral renal agenesis is associated with other structural abnormalities in over 50 percent of cases.

The most common anomalies are vesicoureteral reflux (28 to 41 percent), ureterovesical junction obstruction (11 to 18 percent), and ureteropelvic junction obstruction (6 to 7 percent). The remaining 30 to 50 percent of cases have structural malformations of the heart (eg, septal defects), gastrointestinal tract (eg, anal atresia), genital, or skeletal systems. The incidence of a single umbilical artery is increased with unilateral renal agenesis.</p><p>With true unilateral agenesis, the ureter and the ipsilateral bladder hemitrigone are absent. The embryonic insult that results in unilateral renal agenesis may involve not only the ureteral bud, but also other mesonephric duct derivatives, including the seminal vesicles, vas deferens, and epididymis. The absence of the vas deferens is the most frequent genital anomaly in males with renal agenesis and can be bilateral even if the renal agenesis is unilateral. One-third of men with bilateral congenital absence of the vas deferens have unilateral renal agenesis.

Septate uterus is relatively common and can be associated with renal agenesis. MRKH affects at least 1 of 4500 women and had been considered a sporadic anomaly with suggestion of autosomal dominant inheritance in some cases. Congenital absence of the upper vagina and uterus is the prime feature of the disease. MRKH is generally divided into two subtypes: MRKH type 1, in which only the upper vagina, cervix, and uterus are affected, and MRKH type 2, which is associated with additional malformations generally affecting the renal and skeletal systems, and also includes M&uuml;llerian renal cervical somite (MURCS) characterized by cervicothoracic defects. Of all MRKH cases, 43 percent appear to be type 2 and are associated with unilateral renal agenesis in 47 percent of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Another study reported that the most commonly associated anomalies are urinary tract anomalies in 40 percent, including unilateral renal agenesis (21 percent), pelvic kidney, horseshoe kidney, and ureteric duplication.

The incidence of aneuploidy was 5 percent in isolated bilateral renal agenesis, but there were no cases of aneuploidy in the three fetuses with isolated unilateral renal agenesis. The incidence of karyotypic abnormalities with unilateral or bilateral renal agenesis and multiple anomalies was 33 and 40 percent, respectively. The pattern of chromosomal abnormalities, but not the frequency, was related to the type of renal defect; the risk of chromosomal anomalies was similar for unilateral or bilateral involvement, mild or moderate or severe hydronephrosis, renal agenesis, oligohydramnios or normal amniotic fluid volume. In <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/severe</span> hydronephrosis, renal agenesis and multicystic dysplasia, trisomy 13 and 18 were the most common abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Another study included 95 cases of bilateral renal agenesis, of which 91 percent were diagnosed prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 8.1 percent of cases.

Typically, this syndrome is characterized at birth by pulmonary hypoplasia, limb deformations (altered positioning of hands and feet, clubbed feet, hip dislocation), and flattened facies. It results from external compression of the fetus, limitation of fetal movement, and alteration in the dynamics of lung liquid movement due to severe oligohydramnios. Potter syndrome can also be seen in infants with normal kidneys with prolonged leakage of amniotic fluid or rarely with severe fetal growth restriction; thus, it is not pathognomonic of renal anomalies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">OBSTETRICAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral renal agenesis is incompatible with extrauterine life because prolonged absence of amniotic fluid results in pulmonary hypoplasia leading to severe respiratory insufficiency at birth. Fetuses are able to survive in utero since the placenta is responsible for fetal oxygenation and excretion of wastes; however, there is a higher rate of fetal loss that is probably related to cord compression. As many as 33 percent of fetuses with bilateral renal agenesis die in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Patients who opt for pregnancy termination should be encouraged to consent to autopsy for definitive diagnosis. A nondestructive method of pregnancy termination is desirable for this reason. </p><p>It has been proposed that early serial amnioinfusion is a potential life-saving intervention for some affected fetuses. In animal models, restoration of amniotic fluid through an intra-amniotic catheter prevents pulmonary hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, only anecdotal information is available in human fetuses. In a single case report, serial amnioinfusion was associated with the birth of a preterm neonate (29 weeks) with appropriate lung volume and no stigmata of Potter sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. At nine months of age, she was meeting her gestational age&ndash;adjusted milestones and growing appropriately on daily home peritoneal dialysis, with plans for renal transplantation at 12 to 24 months of age. However, most of her first nine months of life was spent in the hospital due to problems related to prematurity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dialysis. In another report of eight cases from a single institution, serial amnioinfusion through an intra-amniotic catheter restored amniotic fluid volume to normal in all cases with an average delivery interval of 64 days (range 9 to 96 days). There was one death due to pulmonary hypoplasia and another due to unrecognized laryngeal web. The remaining six cases did not have pulmonary hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. More information is needed about complication rates and short- and long-term outcomes, including quality of life, before this procedure can be considered a reasonable intervention for treatment of bilateral renal agenesis and until then should be offered only as approved innovation or research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of second-trimester pregnancy termination&quot;</a>). Serial amnioinfusion may also be associated with chorioamnionitis and abruption, which increase the risk of preterm delivery. Finally, amnioinfusion does not eliminate the need for renal transplantation for long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>In unilateral renal agenesis, a thorough sonographic examination should be performed to look for additional structural defects, especially of the vertebrae, gastrointestinal system, heart, or limbs.

However, genetic factors play a role in the pathogenesis, and multifactorial inheritance is a likely explanation, although the precise method of genetic inheritance is unknown. X linked, autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant inheritance have also been described. In one series of 199 cases, seven siblings were known to be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Twenty to 36 percent of bilateral renal agenesis is associated with familial inheritance; the genetic mechanism may be autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variable expression. The risk of recurrence is reported as 3 to 6 percent, but may reach 8 percent in cases associated with multiple congenital abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].

It is probably worthwhile to evaluate for the presence of both kidneys and the absence of gross renal defects in the mother at the time of prenatal ultrasound, as this can be accomplished quickly and without additional expense.

Proteinuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency appear to be more common later in life in unilateral agenesis. A systematic review of 43 studies with a total number of 2864 patients reported associated CAKUT in 32 percent (of which vesicoureteral reflux was most frequent and was seen in 24 percent of patients), extra-renal anomalies in 31 percent, hypertension in 16 percent, and micro-albuminuria in 21 percent.

The long-term renal complications can be explained by the hyperfiltration hypothesis that associates renal mass reduction leading to a vicious cycle of compensatory glomerular hyperfiltration. In the long run, glomerular hyperfiltration may result in renal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/renal-agenesis-prenatal-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of bilateral renal agenesis is based upon sonographic nonvisualization of the fetal kidneys, ureters, and bladder, accompanied by oligohydramnios, usually after 16 weeks of gestation. Unilateral renal agenesis is more difficult to diagnose and depends upon accurately excluding the presence of a second kidney in the renal fossa or in an ectopic location.
