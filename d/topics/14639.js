Patients in the first group are considered to have pulmonary arterial hypertension (group 1 PAH), while patients in the remaining four groups are considered to have pulmonary hypertension (groups 2, 3, 4, and 5). When all five groups are discussed collectively, the term PH is used. SCD is placed in group 5, as there are some patients with hemodynamics consistent with PAH, while others have features of PH related to left-sided heart disease or thromboembolic disease.

Additionally, up to 22 percent of HbSS children and adolescents have this echocardiographic finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], including children as young as three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, echocardiographic estimates of pulmonary pressures are substantially less accurate than right heart catheterization. Three prospective studies utilizing right heart catheterization have defined the prevalence of PH in SCD to be between 6 and 10.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H879456971\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact pathogenesis of PH in SCD is not known, but a number of potential contributing factors have been implicated, including endothelial injury from recurrent sickling, acute and chronic inflammation, hypercoagulability, chronic intravascular hemolysis, and altered bioavailability of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. Vascular remodeling caused by chronically elevated left heart pressures from diastolic dysfunction may also contribute, similar to PH group 2, which is purely due to left heart disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>One theory is that hemolysis results in increased plasma levels of cell-free hemoglobin (Hgb) in excess of the binding capacity of the Hgb scavengers, haptoglobin and hemopexin. This excess of cell-free Hgb may rapidly deplete circulating NO, although there is continuing disagreement over the impact of this process on NO bioavailability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,19</a>]. Additionally, hemolysis releases arginase I from erythrocytes which limits the availability of arginine for NO synthesis. In addition to these effects on endothelial regulation, increased levels of cell-free Hgb may also contribute to endothelial and vascular smooth muscle dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-pulmonary-arterial-hypertension-group-1#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The epidemiology and pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1)&quot;, section on 'Pathogenetic mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p>NO bioavailability in SCD is additionally impacted by a number of other factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated plasma levels of arginase, also released from red cells, limit the bioavailability of L-arginine, the substrate for NO synthesis, by increasing its breakdown to ornithine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79786 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21-23</a>]. In one study, plasma arginase activity was significantly elevated in 228 patients with SCD as compared with 36 controls; the highest activity was seen in those with secondary pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Lower bioavailability of arginine, as reflected by a low ratio of arginine to ornithine, was associated with markers of inflammation and soluble adhesion molecules, greater severity of pulmonary hypertension, and a significantly increased risk of mortality (RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.2).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, may also be an independent risk factor for endothelial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a study of 177 patients with SCD and 29 controls, ADMA levels correlated with markers of hemolysis, low oxygen saturation, pulmonary hypertension, and early death.

The predominant activities of NO as a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation occur when it reacts with thiols, primarily on albumin, to form S-nitrosothiols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Altered redox biology occurs in SCD, and increased concentrations of the oxidative molecules including singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide exist within the red blood cells of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. These oxidative molecules can react with NO to create nitrate, nitrite, and peroxynitrite, which do not share NO's vasodilatory properties and can be toxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>While much attention has been paid to the role of hemolysis in the pathogenesis of PH in SCD, it is likely that other factors (eg, the impact of local hypoxia on vascular remodeling, genetic variability, and thrombosis) play a role in pathogenesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical variability in sickle cell anemia&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary hypertension'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H879456977\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of PH is difficult in patients with SCD because of the many potential causes of dyspnea in SCD. As an example, both PH and worsening anemia can produce exertional dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, light-headedness, and <span class=\"nowrap\">syncope/near-syncope</span> in patients with SCD. Chest pain is not uncommon during vaso-occlusive crises and may be difficult to link to potential PH, especially in SCD patients who have chronic pain.</p><p>Common PH symptoms, including dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, chest pain, lower extremity edema, syncope or near-syncope, and palpitations, may be observed in SCD patients with or without PH. On the other hand, patients with SCD may not report dyspnea on exertion because they ascribe the symptom to anemia or deconditioning. Sometimes, careful questioning is needed to elicit a history of dyspnea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F94508\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94508 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Physical examination may reveal findings consistent with those observed in PH patients without SCD, such as a pronounced pulmonic component of the second heart sound.

Measuring pulse oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) during ambulation on a flat surface and during stair climbing is critical for identifying patients whose SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;94 percent or decreases by more than 4 percent points with exertion; these patients need a more complete evaluation for PH.

While outcomes studies have not yet identified a benefit from screening, risk stratification based on TRV helps to guide clinical decision making. An elevated TRV measured by Doppler echocardiography identifies adults with SCD who are at increased risk for mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; in children &ge;8 years old, an elevated TRV identifies those at greater future risk for reduced exercise capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Given the often delayed appearance of symptoms and the increased morbidity and mortality risks associated with elevated pulmonary pressures by echocardiogram (regardless of a PH diagnosis), our practice, consistent with guidelines from the American Thoracic Society, is to screen patients with SCD as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F94509\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94509 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A one-time transthoracic Doppler echocardiogram is suggested in asymptomatic children with SCD who are aged 8 to 18 years old (sooner in those with severe hemolytic anemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Based on the TRV result, the patient may require additional evaluation as described below and in the algorithm. (See <a href=\"#H879456989\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for PH'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once SCD patients reach adulthood (18 years of age), Doppler echocardiography is recommended every one to three years, using the shorter intervals for those with respiratory symptoms, TRV &gt;2.5 on prior echocardiogram, greater frequency of pain crises, prior thromboembolic events, or greater severity of hemolytic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>An expert panel from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening for PH in asymptomatic individuals with SCD; however, the panel emphasized the importance of evaluating symptoms suggestive of PH (eg, exercise intolerance, fatigue, peripheral edema, chest pain) with echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. This remains an area of controversy within the field and further research needs to be done to clarify this question.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H879456989\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR PH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PH is typically suspected in SCD patients who have exertional dyspnea, oxygen desaturation, more severe hemolytic anemia, or elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV; &gt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec)</span> on screening echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23,33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,33,35</a>].</p><p>The evaluation of patients with these findings includes pulmonary function tests with a diffusing capacity, a six-minute walk test (6MWT), N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), and transthoracic Doppler echocardiography in those who have not had a recent study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1,6,12,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,12,36,37</a>]. However, none of these noninvasive tests is diagnostic for PH; a right heart catheterization (RHC) is required for diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F94509\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94509 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H879456995\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The following discussion reviews the accuracy of these tests for identifying PH and the interpretation of the results in patients with SCD.

Although much attention has been given to the association of a TRV of &ge;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> with increased mortality risk in SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], each component of the echocardiogram helps to inform the clinician of PH risk.

These data suggest that echocardiography alone has a positive predictive value for PH of only 25 percent. Using a TRV of &gt;2.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> increased the positive predictive value to 64 percent but also increased the false negative rate to 42 percent. This false negative rate was improved by using a 6 minute walk distance of &lt;333 meters and an N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide level &gt;164.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>.

One possible explanation for this observation is the association between an elevated TRV and relative systemic hypertension, lower extremity ulcers, and renal disease, suggesting the presence of a more diffuse systemic vasculopathy in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. While an elevated TRV is not associated with a higher mortality in children with SCD, longitudinal follow-up of 160 children and adolescents with SCD demonstrated a reduction in exercise capacity (decreased six minute walk distance) over 22 months in those with an elevated TRV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This observation suggests that children with SCD and an elevated TRV may be at increased risk of cardiopulmonary decline. At this time, we do not know whether early identification and treatment of patients with SCD and elevated TRV without PH improves survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4247966320\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

PH is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in SCD. The prevalence of PH in SCD is estimated to be between 6 and 10 percent. (See <a href=\"#H322249048\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H879456965\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with SCD may not report dyspnea on exertion, as they may ascribe the symptom to anemia or deconditioning. Careful questioning may be needed to elicit a history of dyspnea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F94508\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94508 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H879456977\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As symptom recognition is often delayed in PH complicating SCD, we suggest obtaining a baseline transthoracic Doppler echocardiogram in children &ge;8 years old, and we recommend that Doppler echocardiograms be performed in adults every one to three years. A tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV) of &ge;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> is indicative of increased mortality risk and requires further evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F94509\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94509 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H879456983\" class=\"local\">'Screening and risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PH may be suspected on the basis of exertional dyspnea and noninvasive testing (eg, TRV &ge;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec,</span> N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide &ge;160 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL,</span> six minute walk distance less than 333 m), but definitive diagnosis requires right heart catheterization (RHC) that identifies a resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) &ge;25 mmHg. RHC is also used to differentiate precapillary PH with a normal pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) from postcapillary PH with an elevated PCWP. (See <a href=\"#H879456995\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once PH is diagnosed, further evaluation is needed to identify any contributors to PH that might require focused treatment, such as hypoxemia due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in situ thrombosis, venous thromboembolism, HIV infection, or portal hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F94509\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94509 \">algorithm 1</a>). We typically obtain laboratory testing (liver function tests, antinuclear antibody, HIV serology), pulmonary function testing, a radionuclide ventilation-perfusion scan, and polysomnography. (See <a href=\"#H879456995\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive treatment for precapillary PH in SCD includes the use of supplemental oxygen and diuretics, as well as treatment of disease modulators, such as sleep disordered breathing and venous thromboembolism (VTE). (See <a href=\"#H879457007\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care and treatment of comorbidities'</a> above and <a href=\"#H879457019\" class=\"local\">'Long-term anticoagulation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-pulmonary-complications-of-sickle-cell-disease#H55815473\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Sleep disordered breathing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For SCD patients with precapillary PH by RHC, we evaluate for VTE, usually with radionuclide ventilation-perfusion lung scanning. In the presence of VTE, but absence of risk factors for hemorrhage, we suggest indefinite anticoagulant therapy, rather than a limited duration of therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H879457019\" class=\"local\">'Long-term anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with SCD and PH by RHC or a TRV of &ge;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec,</span> we recommend treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Chronic transfusion therapy is an alternative for patients who are not responsive to or are not candidates for hydroxyurea therapy. (See <a href=\"#H879457001\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydroxyurea use in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H10100769\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary vasodilator therapy for PH complicating SCD is reserved for patients who are symptomatic (World Health Organization [WHO] class II to IV) and have precapillary PH documented by RHC. For patients with moderate disease (WHO class II to III), we typically initiate therapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist; for patients with advanced disease (WHO class IV), we typically initiate therapy with a prostanoid, following guidelines for other forms of PH. We avoid phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors in SCD due to the associated increase in the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises. (See <a href=\"#H879457025\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary vasodilator therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Advanced therapy'</a>.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-hypertension-associated-with-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gladwin MT, Vichinsky E.
