While some patients with mild AR do not progress for decades, others exhibit progression of the regurgitant lesion with the gradual development of severe AR with subsequent left ventricular dilation, systolic dysfunction, and eventually heart failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54569 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H87466905\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> below.)</p><p>The volume load that burdens the left ventricle in patients with chronic AR leads to a series of compensatory myocardial and circulatory adjustments that can be affected by pharmacologic therapy and reversed by valve replacement. Thus, the management of patients with this disorder requires an understanding of the natural history of the disease, the limited role of medical therapy, and the timing of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the management and prognosis of chronic AR.

Thus, these phases should only be used as general guidelines in making clinical decisions that include all other clinical data and patient preferences. Intercurrent illness, such as infective endocarditis, may alter the clinical course of a patient with mild AR, worsening the degree of regurgitation, and precipitating the need for surgery. Nevertheless, this information has been useful in defining limits that are predictive of the future need for aortic valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic AR should be monitored for changes in symptoms, severity of AR, and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction to reassess the stage of AR. The clinical stages of chronic AR are defined by symptoms, valve anatomy, severity of regurgitation, and LV systolic function (generally quantified as LV ejection fraction [LVEF] and LV dilation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53536\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53536 \">table 2B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Serial monitoring of the severity of AR is generally performed by transthoracic echocardiogram since physical findings are not reliable. If the echocardiogram is inconclusive, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is suggested. Cardiac catheterization is recommended if noninvasive tests are inconclusive or if there is a need to assess coronary anatomy prior to aortic valve surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults#H2272033624\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87466600\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic AR should undergo at least yearly clinical evaluation including history and physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The key symptoms for staging of AR are symptoms of heart failure (and occasionally angina), which generally develop as late manifestations in patients with severe AR. Symptoms may include exertional dyspnea or more severe symptoms of heart failure such as orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Some patients with chronic AR develop exertional or nocturnal angina in the absence of coexistent coronary artery disease due to reduction in coronary flow reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] Patients should be educated on the possible symptoms that may develop and be encouraged to report any that develop prior to the next scheduled routine visit. The physical examination may reveal signs of progressive valvular and ventricular changes but confirmation by imaging is required for staging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87466659\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography is the mainstay for serial monitoring and evaluation of patients with chronic AR. For patients with suspected moderate or severe AR with inconclusive echocardiography findings, CMR provides accurate quantitation of AR regurgitant volume and fraction and precise measurement of LV volumes and function. CMR is particularly helpful when the degree of LV dilation seems greater than expected for AR severity on echocardiography. CMR may also be useful in patients thought to have severe AR without LV enlargement; the diagnosis of severe AR should be questioned if the LV end-diastolic volume or dimension is not increased. In patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, aortic angiography provides a semiquantitative assessment of AR severity.</p><p>Evaluation of LV size and function is important because these parameters predict outcome and do not correlate well with symptoms. As an example, in one report of 450 patients, 28 percent of patients with an LVEF &lt;35 percent were asymptomatic, a value not significantly different from the 37 percent of patients with an LVEF &ge;50 percent who were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Using imaging techniques, LV systolic function is generally quantified as LVEF. Increases in LV end-systolic dimension (LVESD) also reflect worsening LV systolic function. Increased LV end-diastolic dimension (&gt;60 to 65 mm) is also associated with risk of development of symptoms or LV systolic dysfunction, but less so than LVESD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In contrast, more prolonged LV dysfunction, particularly in association with congestive symptoms, is usually predictive of a poor LV response to corrective surgery.
