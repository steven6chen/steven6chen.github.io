Post-lumbar puncture headache (PLPHA; also known as post-dural puncture headache) is caused by leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from the dura with resultant traction on pain-sensitive structures.</p><p>This topic will review PLPHA. The technique of lumbar puncture is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-puncture-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar puncture: Technique, indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other conditions related to altered cerebrospinal fluid pressure are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebrospinal-fluid-physiology-and-utility-of-an-examination-in-disease-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebrospinal fluid: Physiology and utility of an examination in disease states&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-intracranial-hypertension-pseudotumor-cerebri-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri): Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1891 Quincke introduced the lumbar puncture (LP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and in 1898 Bier suffered from and was the first to report PLPHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. He proposed that ongoing leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the dural puncture site was the cause of the headache. This belief is maintained today; it is supposed that CSF leakage through the dural rent made by the LP needle exceeds the rate of CSF production, resulting in low CSF volume and pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The reported incidence of PLPHA ranges from 10 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Of note, cerebral venous thrombosis must also be considered as a possible cause of persisting headache following LP, since LP can rarely precipitate a cerebral venous thrombosis. However, unlike PLPHA, the headache related to cerebral venous thrombosis does not typically change with posture, and the severity usually increases in the acute phase of illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-venous-thrombosis-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PLPHA characteristically present with frontal or occipital headache within 6 to 72 hours of the procedure that is exacerbated in an upright position and improved in the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Associated symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tinnitus, neck stiffness, and visual changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Without treatment, the headache typically lasts 2 to 15 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In various studies of patients undergoing lumbar puncture (LP) for diagnosis or for spinal anesthesia, common risk factors for PLPHA have included female gender, a prior history of headache, age 20 to 40 (or 30 to 50) years compared with other ages, and bevel orientation perpendicular to the longitudinal fibers of the dura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]. </p><p>Two other factors had been thought to increase the risk of developing PLPHA: a larger amount of fluid removed and the experience of the physician performing the procedure. However, neither appears to be important, as physician experience was not a risk factor in the series of 501 patients with PLPHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and the volume of fluid removed was not a risk factor in a meta-analysis from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have attempted to identify factors that decrease the risk of PLPHA, as discussed in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of needle tip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients undergoing lumbar puncture, we recommend the use of spinal needles that have a pencil point tip, rather than needles with a sharp cutting tip. The use of pencil point spinal needles reduces the risk of PLPHA compared with cutting needles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Whitacre and Sprotte needles, which are the most commonly used pencil point needles, have a closed tip shaped like that of a pencil, with the hole on the side of the needle near the tip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F106239\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106239 \">figure 1</a>). The Quincke needle, which is the most commonly used conventional, or cutting, spinal needle, has a sharp, cutting tip, with the hole at the end of the needle.</p><p>The lower incidence of PLPHA with pencil point (atraumatic) needles was illustrated by a 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared atraumatic (pencil point) and conventional (cutting) needles for LP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The review identified 110 trials from 29 countries with over 31,000 subjects. The incidence of postdural puncture headache was significantly lower in the atraumatic group compared with the conventional group (4.2 versus 11 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.40, 95% CI 0.34&ndash;0.47, absolute risk reduction 6.8 percent, number needed to treat to avoid one headache 15). In addition, use of atraumatic needles was associated with a significant reduction in the need for epidural blood patch (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.33&ndash;0.75). There was no significant difference between groups for the success rate of LP on first attempt, LP failure rate, incidence of traumatic tap, and backache.</p><p>Although pencil point needles are more expensive than cutting needles, pencil point needles may be associated with overall health care savings when the costs of LP and treatment of PLPHA are considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Pencil point needles have been referred to as atraumatic or noncutting needles. However, an electron microscopic study of cadaver dural punctures reported that pencil point needles produced coarser dural punctures with more disruption of dural fibers compared with lesions made with a cutting needle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Therefore these needles may be considered more traumatic to the dura. The mechanism by which pencil point needles reduce CSF leak and PLPHA is unknown, but may relate to inflammation and edema at the puncture site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3102589723\"><span class=\"h2\">Needle size and orientation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher needle gauge (smaller needle bore), at least for conventional cutting spinal needles, and orientation of the bevel of a cutting needle parallel to the longitudinal fibers of the dura have been shown to decrease the incidence of PLPHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p>However, technical difficulty may be more likely with smaller bore needles, since these needles tend to bend during insertion and require a longer period for the confirmatory cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to appear at the hub after successful placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Because of the suspected higher failure rate with smaller bore needles, a 22-gauge needle is typically used for routine lumbar puncture (LP).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3181380553\"><span class=\"h2\">Reinsertion of the stylet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reinsertion of the stylet before removing the needle appears to lower the risk of PLPHA. Supporting evidence comes from a randomized prospective trial of 600 patients undergoing diagnostic LP, which found that reinsertion of the stylet prior to removing the needle (versus no reinsertion) resulted in a decreased incidence of PLPHA (absolute risk reduction 11 percent, 95% CI 6.5-16.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different methods of patient positioning after the LP have been proposed to reduce the incidence of PLPHA. However, removal of the needle with the patient in the prone position and placement of the patient in either the supine or prone position after the procedure have not been shown to change the incidence of PLPHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Bedrest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite recommendations for bed rest following LP, this remedy has <strong>not</strong> been shown to significantly decrease the risk of PLPHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. A meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials of LP performed for anesthesia, myelography, or diagnostic purposes found no evidence in any trial that longer bed rest was superior to immediate patient mobilization or shorter bed rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The relative risk of headache among patients undergoing a diagnostic LP was 0.97 with longer bed rest. A similar lack of benefit was noted in a second meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since PLPHA is typically mild and resolves spontaneously, conservative therapy for the first 24 hours is generally recommended. Such conservative therapy includes bed rest and a brief course of oral analgesics that do not degrade platelet function, including opioids. Hydration and abdominal binders are not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>For patients with moderate to severe prolonged headache refractory to conservative measures, we suggest epidural blood patch as the next step.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidural blood patch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although firm conclusions are limited by small patient numbers, a systematic review published in 2010 noted that epidural blood patch reduced the duration and intensity of post-dural puncture headache compared with both conservative treatment and sham procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], based upon the results of three randomized controlled trials with a total of 86 subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. The first epidural blood patch gives relief in the majority of cases, and the second one is successful in nearly all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, epidural blood patch is considered the treatment of choice for patients with PLPHA who fail an initial trial of conservative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28</a>]. In addition, epidural blood patch is considered the definitive therapy of moderate to severe headache following epidural anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics#H1928065332\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse effects of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia for obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Postdural puncture headache'</a>.)</p><p>Placement of an epidural blood patch is a relatively simple procedure in which autologous blood is injected epidurally at or near the site of the prior LP. Epidural blood patching works via two mechanisms. The early, almost immediate, effect is related to volume replacement resulting from dural tamponade, and the latent effect results from sealing of the cerebrospinal fluid leak. Adverse effects are uncommon but include back pain, leg paresthesias, and fever. Some patients require more than one epidural blood patch before headache relief is achieved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690174963\"><span class=\"h2\">Other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other agents that have been evaluated for the treatment of PLPHA in small controlled trials or case series include oral and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caffeine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>], epidural saline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], intramuscular adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and intravenous synthetic ACTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>], oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sumatriptan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sumatriptan</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and sphenopalatine block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Of these, the limited available data suggest modest effectiveness for gabapentin, hydrocortisone, and theophylline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>Although a systematic review concluded that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">caffeine</a> was effective for post-dural puncture headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], based upon two small trials, the conclusion does not seem justified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]; one of the two trials evaluated 40 postpartum woman with PLPHA and reported marginal improvement with oral caffeine that did not reach statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]; the other trial evaluated 41 patients after spinal anesthesia and found that intravenous caffeine was effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], but this finding is undermined by serious limitations of the trial, including an inadequate description of study methods, unclear baseline characteristics of subjects, lack of concealed randomization, and unspecified blinding strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Epidural saline is thought to transiently compress the subarachnoid space and allow the dural defect to seal. Because saline disperses from the epidural space quickly, this technique is associated with a high rate of recurrence. In one series, all patients treated with epidural saline reported relief of their headache, but the headache later recurred in 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Transnasal sphenopalatine block has been used to treat a variety of headaches and facial pain; small case series have reported effective treatment of PLPHA with sphenopalatine block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/43,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,46</a>]. </p><p>Several small studies described the use of adrenocorticotropic hormone for the treatment of PLPHA, with success rates of 70 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. In contrast, a randomized trial in 18 patients found no difference in the severity of headache or requirement for an epidural blood patch with adrenocorticotropic hormone compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-lumbar-puncture-headache/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
