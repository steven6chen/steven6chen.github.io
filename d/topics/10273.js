Upper urinary tract tumors frequently are multiple or occur synchronously with bladder tumors. This may reflect the propensity of neoplastic cells to flow down from the renal pelvis or reflux from the bladder to the ureter, forming an invasive implant.</p><p>Drop metastases may be difficult to differentiate from separate primary lesions. Recurrent bladder tumors often cluster around the ureteral orifice of an affected ureter, thus providing evidence for their origin as metastases from the original primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Tumors of the renal pelvis may also present with multiple filling defects, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction with hydronephrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F97790\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef97790 \">image 3</a>), infundibular stenosis, splaying of the calyces (suggesting a renal mass), or nonvisualization of the renal collecting system. Non-contrast spiral CT can identify renal pelvic or ureteral calculi, which may appear as a filling defect on the contrast study and therefore be confused with a tumor of the collecting system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Ureteropyeloscopy with cystoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flexible fiberoptic ureteroscopes allow direct visualization of the entire collecting system. This procedure is generally safe and well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In a series of 113 patients with upper tract urothelial tumors undergoing ureteroscopy, the diagnosis was confirmed in 74 percent of upper tract tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Ureteropyeloscopy allows biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and may permit endourologic treatment in carefully selected patients. However, such biopsy samples obtained during ureteropyeloscopy are small and can potentially underestimate the risk of more severe disease. As an example, in a series of 56 patients initially thought to have low-grade, non-invasive tumor, 24 (43 percent) were subsequently found to have either high-grade or invasive disease in a repeat biopsy or surgical resection specimen obtained at median of 1.5 months later.

An angiographic catheter is passed into the ureter transurethrally and positioned adjacent to the suspicious lesion. A small nylon or steel bristle brush is passed inside the lumen, and material entrapped by the bristles is sent for histologic and cytologic examination. This technique allows accurate diagnosis of moderately differentiated urothelial cancer, but it may produce false-negative results in patients with low-grade lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Although ureteroscopy and direct biopsy have largely replaced retrograde brush biopsy, brushing and cytology may be useful in evaluating patients with positive upper tract cytology who do not have visible lesions on radiography or ureteroscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-grade urothelial cancers of the upper tract generally are not associated with positive cytology, but higher-grade lesions may generate a positive cytology. In patients with an unexplained positive cytology and negative <span class=\"nowrap\">cystoscopy/biopsy,</span> evaluation of the upper tracts and prostatic urethra is mandatory.</p><p>Cytologic examination of urine is less reliable for upper urinary tract neoplasms than for bladder cancers. Voided specimens for urinary cytology have a poor yield for low-grade tumors, and positive findings may reflect a synchronous bladder tumor. Retrograde collections at the time of ureteroscopy that are aided by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> diuresis may yield better results.</p><p>A pathologist with particular expertise in cytology is critical for the interpretation of such specimens. Cytologically, nuclear characteristics generally indicate the tumor grade, but a direct correlation of the cytologic grade with histologic tumor grade and invasiveness is lacking. As an example, in one series there was agreement between cytology and histologic assessment in 70 percent of patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine biomarkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of a wide range of urinary biomarkers is an area of active research for patients with known or suspected urothelial neoplasms. None of these tests have sufficient diagnostic reliability to replace endoscopy or urine cytology.</p><p>The status of these urinary tumor markers is discussed separately.

Any nodal involvement or distant metastasis constitutes stage IV disease in the TNM system. The TNM stage is correlated with outcome following definitive treatment. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Urothelial cancer of the upper urinary tract may spread by direct extension, via the lymphatics, or hematogenously. Regional lymph nodes are commonly the initial site of metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Routine staging procedures should include cystoscopy to exclude associated bladder cancer, a chest radiograph or computed tomography (CT), radionuclide bone scan if there are symptoms suggesting bone involvement or an elevated bone-derived alkaline phosphatase, and an evaluation of hepatic, renal, and hematologic function. CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen may be performed to assess for the presence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, as well as other sites of disease extension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF LOCALIZED DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment modality for urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis or ureter. Surgery may be carried out via open, laparoscopic, endoscopic, or percutaneous approaches.</p><p>Several factors should be considered when determining the surgical approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is very little difference between kidney-conserving and kidney-sacrificing procedures in terms of operative risk. In fact, nephroureterectomy may be performed more quickly and more easily than some less extensive procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The likelihood of local recurrence, especially with tumors of higher grade, may be higher for kidney-sparing as opposed to kidney-sacrificing procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Removal of the entire ureter and kidney obviates the need for close follow-up for metachronous ipsilateral tumors or local recurrence. This is the predominant site of recurrence and is the major focus of follow-up after kidney-sparing procedures.</p><p/><p>A systematic review conducted by the European Association of Urology (EAU) incorporated data from 22 nonrandomized studies that compared kidney-sparing surgical approaches with radical nephroureterectomy. This analysis suggested that patients with low-grade noninvasive carcinoma had a similar survival outcome when managed with kidney-sparing approaches compared with those managed with radical nephroureterectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephroureterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephroureterectomy, using either a laparoscopic (with or without robotic assistance) or an open approach, with excision of a cuff of normal bladder and bladder mucosa is the gold standard for most patients with urothelial tumors of the renal pelvis or ureter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Less extensive procedures (endourologic surgery, segmental ureterectomy) are appropriate for patients with localized low-grade lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].

Similarly, total ureterectomy and nephrectomy are recommended for patients with ureteral cancers because of the high incidence of multiple ipsilateral lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12961488\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic versus open nephroureterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic and open nephroureterectomy have been compared in a meta-analysis that included a total of 4328 patients in 21 studies who underwent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].
