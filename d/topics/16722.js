Craniofacial surgery, which consists of reconstruction of the cranial vault <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> facial skeleton with or without simultaneous soft tissue reconstruction, can be performed when these deformities interfere with physical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mental well-being.</p><p>Specific syndromes in which craniofacial abnormalities are the primary feature will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and surgical management of craniosynostosis, a subset of craniofacial anomalies, and syndromes in which craniosynostosis is a primary abnormality, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-craniosynostosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of craniosynostosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=craniosynostosis-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Craniosynostosis syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CRANIOFACIAL MICROSOMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Craniofacial microsomia (CFM), also referred to as hemifacial microsomia, oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, or first and second branchial arch syndrome, is a sporadically acquired association of anomalies that results from a defect in development of the first and second branchial arches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76109\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76109 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69339\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69339 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. It is sometimes associated with vertebral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ocular anomalies. Goldenhar syndrome appears to be part of this spectrum (MIM #164210) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The disorder occurs in approximately 1 in 5500 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is typically sporadic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], but autosomal-dominant inheritance has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>The mechanism underlying CFM is uncertain. A vascular insult to the developing branchial arches is the most widely accepted explanation. In an animal model, hemorrhage induced in the region of the first and second branchial arches produced the characteristic facial features. The degree of abnormality was proportional to the size of the hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features of CFM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stigmata of this disorder are indicated by the acronym OMENS, for <strong>o</strong>rbit, <strong>m</strong>andible, <strong>e</strong>ar, facial <strong>n</strong>erve, <strong>s</strong>oft tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Orbital distortion is typically present, as is mandibular hypoplasia. Ear anomalies include microtia, accessory preauricular tags <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pits, and middle ear defects with hearing impairment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57724\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57724 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Facial nerve involvement leads to hypoplasia of the facial muscles. Soft tissue deficiency, such as profound hypoplasia or absence of the parotid gland and masticatory muscles (temporalis, masseter), may be present.</p><p>The defects are unilateral in 85 to 90 percent of cases. In these cases, the right side predominates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The abnormalities occur in variable combinations and range in extent from imperceptible to severe.</p><p>The mandibular abnormalities are described using the Pruzansky classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81249\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81249 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71316\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71316 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 is characterized by mild hypoplasia of the ramus with little abnormality of the mandibular body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In type 2, the mandible has a small condylar head and ramus. The condyle is flat, the glenoid fossa is poorly developed or absent, and the infratemporal surface assumes a flat contour.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In type 3, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) fails to form, and the ramus may exist as a thin bony lamina or may be completely absent. The increasing degree of mandibular hypoplasia is associated with increased difficulty with endotracheal intubation for anesthesia and surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p>Bony abnormalities include a decreased maxillary height on the affected side and an occlusal cant, which is defined as rotation of the occlusal plane (a plane passing through the biting surface of the teeth) in the sagittal view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As a general guide, each degree of rotation of the occlusal plane results in a 0.5 mm change in the dental occlusal relationship. This rotation occurs in all types of CFM, with increasing severity from type 1 to type 3. Occlusal cant can be demonstrated clinically by having the child bite down on a tongue depressor to identify any angulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80119\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80119 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>The zygomatic arch is frequently hypoplastic, and the distance between the lateral orbit and the tragus of the ear is decreased. Cleft palate occurs in 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Auricular abnormalities are described using the OMENS+ classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 describes an external ear that is small but contains all of its components. The auditory canal is not affected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A grade 2 abnormality is characterized by a vertical auricular remnant and complete atresia of the external auditory canal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most severe deformity is grade 3, in which there is a limited remnant of the ear lobe. Hearing does not correlate with the extent of external ear abnormality.</p><p/><p>One study reviewed the clinical features of 121 patients with CFM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Extracraniofacial anomalies occurred in 55 percent and ranged from one anomaly (13 percent) to multiple affected organ systems (42 percent). No gender or side predominance was detected. Central nervous system, cardiac, and skeletal anomalies each occurred in more than 10 percent of cases. Pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and renal deformities were less common. The majority of the heart defects involved the outflow tract or septum. The increased frequency of cardiac anomalies in this condition suggests that abnormal development of neural crest may result in both CFM and conotruncal defects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery for CFM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with CFM do not require surgical correction. This is usually reserved for severe cases. Surgical correction of CFM is usually performed in stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Preauricular skin tags are typically excised before the child is two years old. This is often comforting to the parents, who see steps being taken to remedy their child's problem. Cranial remodeling may be required at approximately 8 to 12 months of age if the craniofacial abnormality is severe and orbital dystopia (malalignment of the orbits) is present. Surgical reconstruction of the oral commissure is performed before two years of age in patients with CFM.</p><p>Distraction osteogenesis of the mandible can be used to correct severe mandibular hypoplasia with airway compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Children with a Pruzansky type 1 mandibular deformity are followed clinically from two to six years of age. Type 2 abnormalities respond favorably to distraction osteogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The more severe type 3 deformities require reconstruction with a costochondral rib graft. There is still significant debate regarding the optimal timing to perform distraction osteogenesis. It has been postulated that by normalizing dimensions at a younger age, the maxilla and overlying soft tissue may have a longer time to develop with a balanced &quot;functional matrix,&quot; thereby improving long-term facial symmetry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, this hypothesis has yet to be confirmed by prospective outcome studies.</p><p>The data on recurrence of the facial deformity after surgery over time are inconsistent as well. One study, for example, found that facial asymmetry improved significantly after distraction (surgical separation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Despite mild relapse observed during the first year, surgical correction was stable in the later years of follow-up. However, another study found that the facial proportions gradually returned to their original asymmetry after the growth of the patient in those treated with mandibular distraction osteogenesis in early childhood, and this growth was similar to the outcomes in an untreated group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. While early surgery may have aesthetic and psychologic advantages, some of these patients may require a second procedure once their growth has completed.</p><p>Orthodontic treatment is started at anywhere from 6 to 14 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and ear reconstruction is performed at approximately eight years. Ears can be fashioned from rib cartilage and placed under the mastoid skin. Alternatively, an osseointegrated post can be surgically implanted in the mastoid area, allowing a prosthetic ear to be firmly attached. The ear is displaced in a downward and anterior direction to accommodate future growth, and calvarial bone grafts may be needed to reconstruct the appropriate topography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Craniofacial growth is completed at approximately 14 to 15 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Further surgical intervention is initiated at that time. Maxillary repositioning (Le Fort 1), mandibular advancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and soft tissue augmentation in the form of microsurgical flap transfers and fat grafting are used to improve both form and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREACHER COLLINS SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), also called mandibulofacial dysostosis, is an autosomal-dominant disorder of craniofacial development with a variable degree of penetrance. It occurs with a frequency of 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 50,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics and pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the majority of cases, abnormal bilateral first and second branchial arch development is due to mutations in the gene <em>TCOF1</em> (Treacher Collins-Franceschetti syndrome 1 [TCS1], MIM #154500), located on chromosome 5 (5q31.3-q33.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. This gene encodes the protein treacle that plays an essential role in ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and ribosome biogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and shows peak expression in the neural crest cells of the branchial arches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/32,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,37</a>]. Missense mutations in the <em>POLR1D</em> (polymerase I, RNA, subunit D) gene located at 13q12.2 cause TCS2 (MIM #613717). TCS type 1 and 2 are autosomal dominant. A third type, TCS3 is autosomal recessive and caused by compound heterozygous mutations in the <em>POLR1C</em> (polymerase I, RNA, subunit C) gene located at 6p22.3 (MIM #248390), which encode subunits of RNA polymerases I and III and have been detected in individuals with TCS who are negative for <em>TCOF1</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The underlying genetic defect is still unknown in approximately 10 percent of patients with TCS.</p><p>Macroscopically, craniofacial tissues such as cartilage, bone, and connective tissues fail to develop correctly as a direct result of neural crest cell dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. One hypothesis posits that significant craniofacial malformations largely arise through defects in the formation, migration, or differentiation of this particular cell population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>According to Tessier's classification of clefts, this syndrome consists of a cleft between the 6 through 8 positions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. TCS may result from insufficient mesodermal penetration affecting soft tissue thickness and leading to aplasia or hypoplasia of maxilla and zygoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Facial clefts and holoprosencephaly&quot;, section on 'Classification of clefts'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features of TCS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Affected patients have malar hypoplasia and a cleft in the zygoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/29,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,42</a>]. The eyes have an antimongoloid slant with colobomas (eyelid notch) along the lateral one-third of the lower lid. Lashes are absent from the medial two-thirds of the lower eyelid. The face has a convex profile with a retrusive chin and jaw, which is associated with a class 2 malocclusion (overbite).</p><p>External ear abnormalities are common. Profound conductive hearing loss is common in severe cases, and children must be fitted early with bone-conducting hearing aids to facilitate development of normal speech. Cleft lip and palate and choanal atresia may occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-loss-in-children-treatment#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing loss in children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Bone conduction hearing devices'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-prenatal-diagnosis-obstetrical-management-and-recurrence-of-cleft-lip-and-or-palate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, prenatal diagnosis, obstetrical management, and recurrence of cleft lip and/or palate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-nose#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the nose&quot;, section on 'Choanal atresia'</a>.)</p><p>The craniofacial abnormalities can result in airway narrowing and respiratory compromise. As a result, affected patients may require prone positioning or surgery to maintain a patent airway. Weak, uncoordinated swallowing may necessitate gavage feedings or placement of a gastrostomy tube. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Surgery for TCS'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery for TCS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with airway and feeding difficulties may require surgery during the first couple of years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. These procedures may include tongue-lip adhesion (glossopexy), distraction osteogenesis of the mandible, tracheostomy, correction of cleft lip <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> palate and choanal atresia, and gastrostomy tube placement.</p><p>Surgical correction of the facial abnormalities in patients with severe TCS is initiated at approximately seven years of age when a significant degree of facial growth has occurred. The zygomatic contour is improved using split calvarial bone grafts or iliac crest grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/44,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46-48</a>]. Lower eyelid colobomas are treated with a layered approach to reconstruction, using mucosal grafts to replace missing lining in conjunction with a lateral canthopexy.</p><p>Surgical correction of the mandible is undertaken at 13 to 16 years of age as the jaw reaches dental and skeletal maturity. In the presence of a functioning temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the preferred treatment is ramus osteotomies and orthodontic manipulation. If the TMJ is absent, a costochondral graft is placed at 6 to 10 years of age and followed up with orthognathic surgery in adolescence. Bilateral distraction osteogenesis of the mandible is also used in an attempt to correct the mandibular hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Finally, the contour of the facial soft tissues generally requires correction at a later stage when the patient has achieved facial skeletal maturity. The use of microsurgical free flap transfer has improved correction of facial soft tissue contours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Improvement in facial appearance has positive psychosocial and social influences. In one report, 20 patients with TCS (mean age 12.2 years) were studied before and at intervals up to four years after craniofacial reconstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Although intellectual ability was unchanged, appearance, self-esteem, and adaptive function improved. The improvement peaked at the one year postoperative assessment and subsequently leveled off.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PIERRE ROBIN SEQUENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pierre Robin sequence, also known as Pierre Robin syndrome, is a condition with multiple causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Most cases are thought to result from hypoplasia of the mandible that occurs before the ninth week of development. Prior to the eighth week, the tongue is interposed between the developing palatal shelves. In the normal course of development, the tongue is drawn down during the 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> weeks, allowing fusion of the palatal shelves. In the Pierre Robin sequence, hypoplasia of the mandible results in posterior displacement of the tongue, preventing palatal closure and producing a cleft palate. The etiology of Pierre Robin sequence is uncertain. Possible mechanisms include genetic disorders, oligohydramnios (which may limit chin growth), myotonia, or connective tissue disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-anomalies-of-the-jaw-mouth-oral-cavity-and-pharynx#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital anomalies of the jaw, mouth, oral cavity, and pharynx&quot;, section on 'Pierre Robin sequence'</a>.)</p><p>Pierre Robin sequence often is an isolated abnormality. However, some cases (37 percent in one series of 74 patients) occur as part of a syndrome with multiple malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. One-third of the patients with associated malformations had Stickler syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS). Some cases of Pierre Robin sequence may thus result from developmental misexpression of SOX9 (sex-reversed Y chromosome [SRY]-box 9, a transcription factor essential for sex and skeletal development) due to disruption of very long range cis regulatory elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Ophthalmologic examination and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) study for chromosome 22 deletion should be performed on patients with Pierre Robin sequence because of the association with Stickler syndrome and VCFS. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Stickler and Marshall syndromes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Velocardiofacial (Shprintzen) syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features of Pierre Robin sequence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of Pierre Robin sequence are micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68928\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68928 \">picture 2</a>). The tongue tends to prolapse backward, leading to airway obstruction that can be life threatening. Respiratory compromise can lead to hypoxia, cardiopulmonary arrest, pulmonary hypertension, and failure to thrive. Feeding problems are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The rapid facial growth that occurs from 3 to 12 months of age leads to resolution of airway problems in a majority of cases. The mortality associated with Pierre Robin sequence is generally related to airway compromise and is higher when associated with prematurity. Mortality rates in term infants with Pierre Robin sequences range from 1.7 to 11.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/52,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,55</a>]. However, the reported mortality rate increases to 26 percent when other anomalies are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of Pierre Robin sequence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two primary issues in patients with Pierre Robin sequence are upper airway obstruction and feeding difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/52,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,56</a>]. Affected patients should be monitored to detect apnea and airway obstruction. Prone positioning is indicated, especially during feeding, to minimize airway obstruction. A rubber tube placed through the nose (nasopharyngeal trumpet) may protect the airway while awaiting compensatory growth. More invasive temporizing procedures are needed if respiratory obstruction is unresponsive to conservative measures.</p><p>Nonsurgical options for treatment of upper airway obstruction include noninvasive respiratory support (NRS) and a nasopharyngeal airway (NPA). Surgical options include mandibular distraction osteogenesis and glossopexy. Cases of airway obstruction that are refractory to these measures may require a tracheostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tracheostomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tracheostomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NRS uses continuous positive airway pressure or noninvasive positive pressure ventilation to correct the airway obstruction.
