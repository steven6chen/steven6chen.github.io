It primarily affects children under the age of five years. In the United States and Western Europe, the reported annual incidence of STEC HUS is approximately two to three per 100,000 children less than five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The remaining childhood HUS cases are generally divided into primary HUS caused by complement dysregulation, with an estimated prevalence of seven per one million children in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and secondary HUS caused by pneumococcal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368186215\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY HUS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4246740349\"><span class=\"h2\">Complement-mediated HUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is primarily due to mutations in the genes for complement proteins C3, CD46 (previously known as membrane cofactor protein [MCP]), and complement factors H, B, and I. It is estimated that approximately 50 percent of non-Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) cases result from mutations in these genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Acquired complement dysregulation due to antibodies to complement factors B and H has also been implicated as a cause of HUS. The clinical manifestation, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of complement-mediated HUS are discussed in detail separately.

The authors suggest loss of <em>DGKE</em> function results in a prothrombotic state as DGKE inactivates arachidonic acid-containing diacylglycerols (DAG), an activator of protein kinase C, which promotes thrombosis. In one consanguineous family with a novel truncating mutation in <em>DGKE</em> (p.K101X), patients showed significant complement activation and low C3 levels. Aggressive plasma infusion therapy controlled systemic symptoms and prevented renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Another study of four patients with <em>DGKE</em> mutations found that three of them also carried heterozygous mutations in thrombomodulin (<em>THBD</em>) or <em>C3</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Plasma therapy was effective in two patients with <em>DGKE</em> and <em>THBD</em> mutations, while plasma infusions and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">eculizumab</a> were effective in the patient with <em>DGKE</em> and <em>C3</em> mutations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>PLG</em> mutations &ndash; A comprehensive genetic analysis of complement and coagulation genes in patients with atypical HUS detected not only mutations in complement regulatory genes in over one-half of the patients, but also novel mutations in several genes in the coagulation system, particularly ones in the <em>PLG </em>gene, which encodes plasminogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Plasminogen deficiency results in a decreased degradation of thrombi, promoting thrombosis. The authors speculate that thrombi in small vessels cause mechanical damage to erythrocytes, releasing peptides (such as heme), or overexpression of other unidentified factors that activate the complement system, resulting in endothelial cell damage and HUS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombomodulin mutations &ndash; Thrombomodulin is a cofactor in the initiation of the protein C anticoagulant pathway, which accelerates the inactivation of C3b by factor I. In a study of 152 patients with atypical HUS (ie, non-Shiga toxin-producing <em>E. coli</em> [STEC]-HUS), seven patients had six different heterozygous mutations of the <em>THBD</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In vitro studies demonstrated that the mutated <em>THBD</em> gene resulted in dysregulation of the complement system because it was less effective than normal thrombomodulin in converting C3b to its inactive form iC3b.

Mutations of <em>MMACHC</em> result in functional cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency. Cobalamin is a cofactor for both methionine-synthase, which transforms homocysteine to methionine, and methyl-transferase, which is involved in the conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As a result, patients with CblC mutations have a functional defect of both methylmalonyl CoA mutase and methionine synthase resulting in methylmalonic acidemia with homocystinuria.</p><p>Clinical manifestations of patients with <em>MMACHC</em> mutations include neurocognitive disease (microcephaly, seizures, developmental delay, ataxia, hypotonia) and atypical HUS. The first symptoms, which are nonspecific, may occur in the neonatal period and consist of anorexia, vomiting, failure to thrive, hypotonia, seizures, and lethargy. In these patients, symptoms of HUS are typically severe and observed beyond infancy. The prognosis is poor due to multiorgan failure. Later-onset forms presenting with <span class=\"nowrap\">psychiatric/behavior</span> problems and myelopathy have been reported with better prognosis. The diagnosis, which should be suspected in patients with megaloblastosis, is made by amino acid and organic acid chromatography that reveal a marked increase of homocysteine and a low level of methionine in the plasma, very high rates of urinary excretion of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, and by genetic testing of the <em>MMACHC</em> gene.

Pneumococcal-associated HUS occurs mainly in infants and young children, and rarely affects adults. In a retrospective study from seven tertiary centers in the United Kingdom, 43 of the 315 cases (14 percent) of HUS diagnosed between 1998 and 2005 were associated with pneumococcal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a Canadian survey limited to cases of HUS not preceded by a diarrheal prodromal illness, 9 of 27 cases were due to pneumococcal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The incidence of HUS after pneumococcal disease is 0.5 percent. An analysis of the Kids' Inpatient Database reported pneumococcal-associated HUS accounted for 4.6 percent of all HUS discharges, 0.7 percent of all invasive pneumococcal disease discharges, and 3 percent of all discharges for complicated pneumonia in the United States in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>After the introduction of the seven-valent pneumococcal vaccine, the incidence of cases due to serotypes 3, 6A, 12F, and 19A, which were not covered in the vaccine, has increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/7,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25</a>]. The effect of newer vaccines, such as the 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine introduced in 2010 and the 23-valent vaccine (which is only recommended for children below two years of age who are at risk for pneumococcal infection), on the underlying causative serotype is yet to be determined.

Proposed mechanisms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HUS-inducing pneumococci express surface proteins that bind plasminogen, which generates plasmin, resulting in fibrinogen degradation and complement activation and leads to endothelial cell damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>N-acetyl neuraminidase (sialidase) released during pneumococcal infection cleaves sialic acid on the cell glycocalyx, resulting in the exposure of the normally hidden Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T antigen) on red blood cells, platelets, and glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The T antigen is recognized by a natural IgM antibody, a normal plasma constituent, which leads to polyagglutination of patients' red cells and hemolysis. However, two observations argue against a pathogenetic role for the T antigen. First, the IgM is a cold antibody and is therefore unlikely to cause agglutination in vivo. Second, T antigen can be detected in approximately half of children with invasive pneumococcal disease without HUS and is not found in all children with pneumococcal-associated HUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An alternative proposal is based on the finding that desialylation by neuraminidase disrupts complement factor H (complement regulatory protein) binding sites, which would result in the inability of complement factor B to bind with C3 convertase. This would lead to unregulated complement activation and cell injury similar to the mechanism observed in patients with complement-mediated HUS due to identified mutations resulting in complement dysregulation.

In addition, empiric antibiotic therapy for invasive pneumococcal disease should be initiated while awaiting culture results and sensitivities.
