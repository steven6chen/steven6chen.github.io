The most common group consists of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). These neoplasms are most often located in the stomach and proximal small intestine, but they can occur in any portion of the alimentary tract and occasionally in the omentum, mesentery, and peritoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. GISTs are identified mainly by expression of the KIT protein and frequently harbor activating mutations in the <em>KIT</em> or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (<em>PDGFRA) </em>genes. </p><p>A far less common group of mesenchymal gastrointestinal tract neoplasms is comprised of a spectrum of tumors that are identical to those that might arise in the soft tissues throughout the rest of the body. These include lipomas, liposarcomas, leiomyomas, true leiomyosarcomas, desmoid tumors, schwannomas, and peripheral nerve sheath tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, classification, molecular pathogenesis, and diagnostic workup of localized GISTs will be reviewed here. Treatment for GISTs is discussed elsewhere.

While the incidence was difficult to assess in earlier years because of the lack of diagnostic criteria, studies over the past decade or so place this in the range of 7 to 15 cases per million population per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>]. As an example, a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) analysis of histologically confirmed GISTs after the implementation of a GIST-specific histology code identified 6142 cases diagnosed between 2001 and 2011, with an incidence of 0.68 per 100,000. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Moreover, a prospective study of the population in the French Rhone Alps region conducted in 2005 to 2007 reported a crude incidence of GIST of 11.2 per million per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>It is important to note, however, that autopsy data suggest that the frequency of incidentally detected subcentimeter gastric GIST lesions may be much higher than previously estimated. Two studies examining consecutive autopsy specimens found small GISTs (sized &lt;1 mm to 1 cm) in 22.5 to 35 percent of the cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. All lesions shared typical GIST immunohistochemical (positive for KIT and CD34 expression) and molecular features (<em>KIT</em> or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha [<em>PDGFRA</em>] mutation in up to 50 percent of the cases for which sufficient DNA was available), and almost all lesions were located in the upper stomach. Some have suggested that given the relatively low annual incidence of clinically diagnosed GISTs, only a few microscopic tumors may grow to a clinically relevant size with malignant potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Further studies are needed to confirm these observations and to clarify the genetic events responsible for the transformation of microscopic GIST lesions into clinically relevant GISTs.</p><p>GISTs occur predominantly in middle-aged and older individuals, and rarely in those under the age of 40.

However, their immunophenotypic profile differed from that of leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas arising from other sites (eg, uterus or soft tissues). By the early 1990s, it became apparent that GISTs represent a distinct entity from other mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Up to two-thirds of GISTs were found to be immunopositive for CD34 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, CD34 was neither selective nor specific for GIST.</p><p>A significant breakthrough was achieved with the identification of the near-universal expression of CD117 antigen by GISTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], while true leiomyosarcomas, leiomyomas, and other spindle cell tumors of the gastrointestinal tract are typically CD117 negative. CD117 antigen is synonymous with the transmembrane KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, the product of the <em>KIT</em> protooncogene (the human homolog of the viral oncogene <em>v-KIT</em>, and therefore, sometimes referred to as <em>c-KIT</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. At the same time, it was found that GISTs can carry a mutation in the <em>KIT</em> gene, thereby leading to a structural variant of the KIT protein, which is abnormally activated and enables oncogenic signaling in the cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. A number of large studies have since confirmed this result, and it is now clear that more than 80 percent of GISTs carry a mutation in the <em>KIT</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2443025204\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular origin of GISTs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), sometimes referred to as the gastrointestinal pacemaker cells, form the interface between the autonomic innervation of the bowel wall and the smooth muscle itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. They have the immunophenotypic and ultrastructural features of both smooth muscle and neuronal differentiation and serve to regulate peristalsis. Because GISTs, similar to ICCs, express KIT protein and two-thirds of GISTs also express CD34 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], a link between the two has been proposed. It is assumed that GISTs originate from CD34-positive ICC stem cells within the wall of the gut and differentiate toward the pacemaker cell phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>].</p><p>In support of the origin of GISTs from ICCs, resected tumors have been accompanied by diffuse ICC hyperplasia in the adjacent gut wall (Auerbach plexus) in several kindreds with familial GIST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/57-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-61</a>]. These lesions are thought to represent precursor lesions to GIST in these patients. Diffuse ICC hyperplasia may also represent a precursor lesion to sporadic GIST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and in these cases, they must be distinguished from syndromic ICC hyperplasia associated with hereditary GIST syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, the curious fact of primary GISTs arising outside of the gastrointestinal tract in the omentum and mesentery, or even in the retroperitoneum (often referred to as extragastrointestinal stromal tumors [EGIST]), remains.

Compared with leiomyomas, the eosinophilic cytoplasm is paler and often has a fibrillary appearance.

In the gut, they are usually small and well circumscribed. The tumors typically arise from the muscularis propria; growth may be intraluminal, extraluminal, or a combination with a dumbbell shape. Leiomyomas can range in size from less than 0.5 cm (microleiomyomas) to as large as 30 cm.</p><p>On CT, leiomyomas may appear as a smoothly contoured, hypodense lesion immediately adjacent to the gut lumen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53060\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53060 \">image 2</a>). True leiomyosarcomas are typically large masses that have varying degrees of internal necrosis with heterogeneous contrast enhancement. Dystrophic calcification may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-classification-clinical-presentation-prognostic-features-and-diagnostic-work-up-of-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors-gist/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].</p><p>Microscopically, leiomyomas are formed of fascicles of benign-appearing spindle cells without nuclear atypia, mitoses are sparse or absent, and necrosis virtually never occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74175\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74175 \">picture 5</a>). The nucleus is centrally located and oval, but may be displaced to one side by distinct vacuoles, suggesting signet-ring cells.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GISTs that arise in adults are characterized by the near-universal expression of CD117 antigen, which is in contrast to other spindle cell tumors of the gastrointestinal tract (ie, leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas) that are typically CD117 negative. CD117 antigen is synonymous with the KIT transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, the gene product of the protooncogene <em>KIT</em>. In more than 80 percent of GIST cases, a mutation in the <em>KIT</em> gene is detected leading to an abnormally activated KIT protein and enabling oncogenic signaling in the cell. A subset of GISTs lacking <em>KIT</em> mutations have activating mutations in the gene that encodes a related receptor tyrosine kinase, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (<em>PDGFRA</em>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Molecular pathogenesis and KIT mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GISTs occur predominantly in middle-aged and older individuals, and rarely in those under the age of 40. Although the majority are sporadic, several kindreds with heritable mutations in the <em>KIT</em> or <em>PDGFRA</em> genes have been identified. These families have a predisposition to multiple gastric and small bowel GISTs and often display other characteristic features, such as skin hyperpigmentation, dysphagia, paragangliomas, or intestinal fibromatosis and inflammatory fibroid polyps. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GISTs are rare in children, and at this younger age, they often arise as a component of a defined syndrome (Carney-Stratakis syndrome, Carney triad, neurofibromatosis type 1 [NF1]). In contrast to adults, 85 percent of GISTs arising in children are wild type for <em>KIT</em> and <em>PDGFRA</em>. Many of these have mutations in a gene encoding a subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme (&quot;SDHX&quot;) or an epigenetic methylation of the SDH subunit C (SDHC) gene promoter, which leads to silencing of <em>SDHC</em> gene expression. (See <a href=\"#H3194789498\" class=\"local\">'KIT/PDGFRA &quot;wild-type&quot; GISTs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1013925\" class=\"local\">'Pediatric GIST'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical behavior of GISTs is highly variable; the main prognostic determinants are tumor size, mitotic rate, and tumor location. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Tumor site, size, and mitotic rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prognostic models, including the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system, are available to delineate prognostic groups and estimate tumor aggressiveness based upon these and other factors, such as tumor rupture. (See <a href=\"#H4114455655\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic models'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some GISTs are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. More often, they are associated with nonspecific symptoms (ie, early satiety, bloating), unless they ulcerate, bleed, or grow large enough to cause pain or obstruction. While GISTs are most often located in the stomach and proximal small intestine, they can occur in any portion of the alimentary tract, including occasionally in the omentum, mesentery, and peritoneum (extragastrointestinal stromal tumors [EGIST]). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is a preferred initial imaging study for screening and staging, except perhaps in a patient who cannot receive intravenous contrast. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be preferred for GISTs at specific sites, such as the rectum or liver, especially when evaluating for surgery. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'CT and MRI scanning'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative biopsy is not generally recommended for a resectable lesion in which there is a high suspicion for GIST and the patient is otherwise operable. However, a biopsy is preferred to confirm the diagnosis if metastatic disease is suspected or if preoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> is considered prior to attempted resection in a patient who has a large locally advanced lesion thought to represent a GIST. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Necessity of preoperative biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The combined use of cytologic analysis, immunohistochemistry for KIT, and polymerase chain reaction for <em>KIT</em> mutations (if needed) may permit the preoperative diagnosis of some GISTs by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Tissue rather than cytologic study may be required for a definitive diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is highly sensitive for detecting tumors with a high glucose metabolism, including GIST, and can provide early efficacy data for tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, nearly all the data obtained by PET scan imaging can be found in a good-quality traditional intravenous-contrasted CT scan, with superior anatomic definition.
