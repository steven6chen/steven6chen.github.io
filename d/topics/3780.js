However, since flucytosine levels are not readily available in many clinical settings, monitoring for bone marrow toxicity with a thrice weekly complete blood count can act as a surrogate of drug accumulation.

If immune function improves rapidly following the commencement of ART, systemic or local inflammatory reactions may occur at the site or sites of the pre-existing infection. According to one meta-analysis, IRIS occurred in approximately 13 percent of all immunosuppressed patients initiating ART, but occurred with increased frequency among those with cryptococcal disease (ie, 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The inflammatory reaction is usually self-limited, especially if the pre-existing infection is effectively treated. However, long-term sequelae and fatal outcomes may occur, particularly when the inflammatory reaction occurs within the central nervous system (CNS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14913643\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain patients who have experienced an initial clinical improvement on antifungal therapy will develop symptoms of cryptococcal IRIS after initiating ART, potentially leading to significant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. These symptoms are usually localized to the CNS and are related to increased intracranial pressure (ICP):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased alertness</p><p/><p>Most cases of cryptococcal IRIS occur one to six weeks after ART is initiated (median 29 to 33 days); however, late presentations (up to 10 months after ART is started) have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].

However, symptomatic patients with CSF pleocytosis and increased ICP are at risk for herniation. Serial LPs are important in managing increased ICP and should be performed until stabilization of symptoms and normalization of ICP occurs, although the exact timing of LP is determined on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is required. (See <a href=\"#H645246\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring of intracranial pressure'</a> above.)</p><p>We and other experts also use glucocorticoids to treat patients with symptomatic increased ICP related to IRIS based upon case reports and extrapolation from other disease processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis/abstract/36,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,40</a>]. Since there are no controlled trials examining the use of glucocorticoids for IRIS, the dose and duration of treatment are unclear. We typically initiate 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> daily, and then taper the dose over two to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A good alternative is to administer a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> taper, such as the one that is used for the treatment of tuberculous meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-nervous-system-tuberculosis#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central nervous system tuberculosis&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>). </p><p>However, we do <strong>not</strong> routinely administer glucocorticoids at the start of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis treatment (which is often done in patients with tuberculous meningitis) since they do not appear to reduce the risk of IRIS and they can have a negative impact on the killing of yeast in the CSF and increase morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>There are minimal data regarding the successful role for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents or immunosuppressive biologicals such as anti-tumor necrosis factor inhibitors to control inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The timing of ART initiation must weigh the potential advantage of early immune recovery when ART is administered soon after initiating antifungal therapy against the risk of developing immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (see <a href=\"#H14913615\" class=\"local\">'Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome'</a> above). With some opportunistic infections (OIs), such as <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia, early ART initiation is clinically beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, trials comparing early versus delayed initiation of ART in patients undergoing treatment for cryptococcal meningoencephalitis consistently show improved survival with delayed initiation, and ART should not be used during the induction period of antifungal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. </p><p>The best data for these recommendations come from a trial of 177 HIV-infected patients from Uganda and South Africa who were randomly assigned to receive either early ART (within one to two weeks after initiating antifungal therapy) or delayed ART (five weeks after initiating antifungal therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-management-and-monitoring-during-antifungal-therapy-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-cryptococcal-meningoencephalitis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Antifungal therapy in these resource-limited settings included two weeks of induction therapy with amphotericin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> followed by 12 weeks of consolidation therapy with fluconazole alone. The mortality at 26 weeks was significantly higher in patients who received early compared with delayed ART (45 versus 30 percent; hazard ratio 1.73; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.82). Most excess deaths associated with early ART initiation occurred two to five weeks after initiating antifungal therapy and among patients who had fewer than five white cells in their initial cerebrospinal fluid sample (a marker of more severe immunosuppression).</p><p>Deciding when to initiate ART within the two- to ten-week window is less clear since there are no high quality data on this issue. We typically delay ART by up to ten weeks (ie, after induction and consolidation antifungal therapy) for patients who have close follow up and access to treatment that can prevent further OIs (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-prevention-of-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of prevention of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>). This approach minimizes the risk of IRIS and avoids drug interactions associated with high-dose antifungal therapy. However, for individuals without these resources, ART may start four to five weeks after initiating antifungal therapy since the benefits of a more rapid immune recovery usually outweigh the risks of IRIS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H333031884\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

For patients with access to close medical follow up and preventative therapy, we often start ART ten weeks after the initiation of antifungal therapy to minimize the risks of IRIS and drug interactions.
