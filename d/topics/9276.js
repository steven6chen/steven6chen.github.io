Unfortunately, the numbers of useable donor hearts available to perform heart transplantation for these patients has not increased in the United States and has actually decreased in Europe over recent years and the supply is and will remain inadequate for the population who could benefit from heart transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mechanical support of the circulation with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) is a rapidly evolving field. LVADs are efficient devices that assist and support the circulation and they are being inserted into an increasing number of patients with advanced HFrEF. Mechanical circulatory support with a ventricular assist device (VAD) is a life-saving therapy for patients with decompensating advanced heart failure who fail to improve or stabilize with optimal medical therapy. </p><p>This topic will discuss intermediate- and long-term VAD therapy. Short-term mechanical support and practical management of long-term mechanical circulatory support are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Practical management of long-term mechanical circulatory support devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787795\"><span class=\"h1\">CATEGORIES OF USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A VAD can be used as a bridge to cardiac transplantation (to sustain life until a donor heart becomes available), as a bridge to decision (regarding transplant eligibility), as destination (or permanent) therapy, or as a bridge to recovery of heart function. Most patients receiving mechanical cardiac support for these indications receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) with less than 15 percent receiving biventricular support in the form of biventricular device (BiVAD; left plus right ventricular support) or total artificial heart (TAH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787804\"><span class=\"h2\">Bridge to transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermediate- or long-term left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) can be used as bridges to transplantation (BTT) in patients with advanced heart failure with deteriorating clinical status who are or may be candidates for heart transplantation but are&nbsp;too unstable to wait any longer without circulatory support. LVADs are inserted into patients who have worsening New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IIIb or IV heart failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>) often despite inotropic plus intraaortic balloon pump support. Such patients often also have end organ dysfunction or other potentially reversible medical conditions that may be temporary contraindications to cardiac transplantation (for which LVAD use may be considered a &quot;bridge to candidacy&quot; or &quot;bridge to decision&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Not only are LVADs life-saving in these deteriorating patients who might otherwise die before a donor heart becomes available, but they can also improve secondary organ function prior to transplantation, reduce pulmonary hypertension, and enable improvement in nutritional status, all of which are associated with improved post-transplant survival. </p><p>Due to the stagnant numbers of donor hearts, an increasing number of patients have been requiring LVAD support for survival prior to transplantation. The International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) 2010 report documented that pre-transplant support with intravenous inotropes decreased from 55.3 to 44.5 percent while LVAD therapy has increased from 13.4 to 20.1 percent over the last two decades (1992 to 2001 versus 2002 to <span class=\"nowrap\">2006/2009)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The survival of status I patients continues to depend on urgent cardiac replacement therapy with 52.4 percent of patients listed between 2000 and 2005 dying within six months without heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H599696\"><span class=\"h2\">Bridge to decision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients receive an LVAD before a final decision regarding transplantation eligibility has been able to be reached (use of which has been termed &quot;bridge to decision&quot; or BTD). This is because many patients on inotropic agents or intraaortic balloon pump support have secondary end organ dysfunction or other potentially reversible medical conditions, which may be temporary contraindications to cardiac transplantation. For them, mechanical support may be able to reverse the contraindication. Thirty-six percent of LVADs in the INTERMACS database implanted from June 2006 to June 2013 were inserted as a BTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], attesting to the frequency of VAD use for this reason. </p><p>While BTD is a clinical paradigm used for patients whose future candidacy for transplantation is uncertain, its use complicates planning and is discouraged by some third party payers. When possible, the device should be implanted as a bridge to transplantation or as destination therapy and the patient should be crossed over when appropriate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787811\"><span class=\"h2\">Destination therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As survival rates with LVAD support have improved, the use of these devices as permanent (rather than &quot;bridge&quot; therapy) has evolved and expanded considerably [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Destination therapy (DT) refers to this long-term use of LVADs as an alternative to transplantation in candidates in patients with end stage heart failure who are considered to be ineligible for transplantation. The current generation of LVADs are more durable than their predecessors and have lower complication rates, particularly low rates of device failure; hence, patients can be maintained on them for much longer periods of time with lower morbidity, making destination therapy now a realistic option for many patients. </p><p>There are now 141 centers in the United States that have been designated DT centers by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the United States, there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion of implants for DT as a primary indication from 14.7 percent between 2006 and 2007 to 45.7 percent in 2014, and the proportion implanted for bridge to transplantation (BTT) has decreased from 42.4 to 30.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. A report from the INTERMACS database on 2506 primary adult LVADs implanted between June 2006 and September 2010 showed that the most common contraindications to transplantation in DT patients were advanced age, renal dysfunction, high body mass index (BMI), pulmonary hypertension, and other comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There is some cross-over, with nearly 10 percent of patients implanted designated as DT subsequently undergoing transplantation by 12 months after LVAD implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In many patients, this is due to unexpected recovery of end organ damage although in some the crossover to transplant is due to device complications such as inability to cure a device infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The various causes of death after LVAD implantation for DT reflect associated co-morbidities and the generally limited reserve of these patients who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) report on 385 patients identified risk factors for early death that included age, critical cardiogenic shock, diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, low sodium, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), need for concomitant surgery, and need for biventricular assist device (Bi-VAD) support (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F100105\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100105 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Risk factors for death throughout the implantation period were older age, diabetes, pulmonary hypertension, hyponatremia, and pulsatile flow (older generation) LVAD support.</p><p>Risk factors for death in the whole LVAD population (all indications) were older age, female sex, higher BMI, lower INTERMACS Class, implantation for DT, on a ventilator, having an ICD, blood type other than O, history of stroke, low albumin, high creatinine and BUN, history of dialysis or previous cardiac surgery, concomitant cardiac surgery, and signs of right-sided heart dysfunction (high central venous pressure, elevated bilirubin, or concurrent RVAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787818\"><span class=\"h2\">Bridge to recovery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is now evidence that LVAD unloading can promote recovery of myocardial function (see <a href=\"#H22787918\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evidence'</a> below). This recovery can be sufficient to allow device removal without cardiac transplantation and leave the patient with an excellent functional capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and quality of life. When this occurs, the precious resource of a donor organ can be used for another needy individual. The strategy of device implantation to promote recovery of myocardial function is known as &quot;bridge to recovery.&quot; Usually, however, the device is not implanted specifically as a &quot;bridge to recovery&quot; but as DT or BTT and then if sufficient myocardial recovery has been deemed to have occurred on testing of the underlying cardiac function explantation of the pump considered. </p><p>In the major published studies addressing the issue of myocardial recovery with VAD support in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, a strategy that combined mechanical unloading using LVAD support with specific pharmacologic interventions to maximize the incidence of myocardial recovery and to improve the durability of recovery following explantation resulted in much higher VAD explantation rates than had previously been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The pharmacologic interventions of the first phase of the therapy (including ACE inhibitors [or angiotensin II receptor blockers], beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists), were designed to reverse pathological hypertrophy and remodeling and to normalize cellular metabolic function. These pharmacologic agents were given at very high doses, doses that these patients would not have tolerated before pump insertion because of hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal dysfunction. When maximal reverse remodeling was felt to have been achieved, clenbuterol was given as the second phase. This drug is an anabolic steroid that has been shown to induce physiologic hypertrophy in several experimental models, including those with pressure overload hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Myocardial recovery in patients on an LVAD provides an ideal and so far unique opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms that occur during reverse remodeling as the patient recovers. Myocardial samples obtained at the time of device insertion and later removal, along with serum samples, provide an ideal opportunity to explore the myocardial and circulating factors involved in the recovery of human heart failure.</p><p>VADs may well be used as a platform to induce myocardial recovery by combining with other therapies, such as stem cells, in the future.

They can broadly be divided into first, second, and third generation devices according to their mechanism of operation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H601048\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST GENERATION DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first generation of ventricular assist devices were the pulsatile positive displacement pumps, which include the HeartMate I, the Thoratec Paracorporeal Ventricular Assist Device (PVAD), and the Novacor. These pulsatile volume-displacement devices provide excellent hemodynamic support and improved survival but have limitations, particularly limited long-term device durability, the need for extensive surgical dissection to implant, the presence of a large external lead (which is more prone to infection), an audible pump, and the need for medium-large body habitus. Hence, although most early published studies of LVADs involved these devices, only the Thoratec Paracorporeal Ventricular Assist Device is still commercially available and it is rarely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787832\"><span class=\"h2\">HeartMate I device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HeartMate I (HM I) was inserted in over 5000 patients. It has a pusher-plate actuator that is powered pneumatically or electrically. A cannula is placed in the apex of the left ventricle and blood flows through a Dacron conduit through a porcine valve to the pump and is returned into a Dacron outflow graft through another porcine valve inserted in the ascending aorta. The HeartMate I contains a unique blood pumping surface consisting of titanium microspheres and a fibrillar textured inner surface that promoted the formation of a &quot;pseudointima&quot; that resists thrombogenesis. Thus, the only antithrombotic therapy needed was <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>.</p><p>The HeartMate I underwent several design improvements and evolved from the pneumatic to the vented electric (VE) to the XVE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86141\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86141 \">figure 1</a>). However, the excellent results and better durability with the second and third generation devices have made its use obsolete and it is no longer in production. However, it was this device that was used in the landmark REMATCH trial (discussed below), which became the basis for approval of destination therapy. (See <a href=\"#H601173\" class=\"local\">'As destination therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787839\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoratec paracorporeal ventricular assist device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Thoratec paracorporeal ventricular assist device (PVAD) has been inserted in over 3000 patients. It has a 65 mL stroke volume pumping chamber and two mechanical valves. It has the advantage that it can be used as an LVAD, RVAD, or two together as a BIVAD. Alternating positive and negative air pressure generated by a console or portable pneumatic driver produces a beat rate of 40 to 110 bpm and a flow rate of 1.3 to 7.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>. The PVAD is positioned outside the body (paracorporeal) on the anterior abdominal wall with cannulas crossing into the chest wall. Patients supported by this pump require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (goal INR 2.5 to 3.5) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy. The IVAD was an implantable version of this pump. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787846\"><span class=\"h2\">Novacor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Novacor LVAD was implanted in over 1600 patients for durations of up to 6.1 years, but has been discontinued after trials showing a high rate of stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787853\"><span class=\"h1\">SECOND GENERATION DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been a dramatic shift from use of the first generation pulsatile pumps to use of continuous flow devices, including the second generation devices (axial flow pumps) and third generation devices (centrifugal flow pumps) as shown in the 2014 INTERMACS report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. INTERMACS records show an increase in the use of continuous flow pumps from none implanted in 2007 to 2420 implanted in 2013 while use of pulsatile LVADs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] decreased from 316 in 2007 to only 20 in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Continuous flow pumps account for 100 percent of patients receiving DT since 2010 and more than 95 percent of patients receiving primary MCS implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Unlike the first generation devices, these continuous flow pumps have only one moving part, the rotor, and hence are much more durable. They are also smaller (principally through elimination of the blood sac or reservoir necessary for a pulsatile system), quieter, and hence surgical implantation is generally less traumatic. Continuous flow pumps also have smaller drivelines and hence tend to have lower rates of driveline infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787860\"><span class=\"h2\">HeartMate II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HeartMate II (HM II) device is a continuous flow axial blood pump (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86142\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86142 \">figure 2</a>) with an internal rotor with helical blades that curve around a central shaft. As the blood flows around the pump rotor, the spinning action of the rotor, with its three curving blades, introduces a radial or tangential velocity to the blood flow as it imparts kinetic energy to the blood, which then flows past the outlet stator vanes. The twisted shape of the outlet stator vanes converts the radial velocity of the blood flow to an axial direction. The pump weighs 350 g and it is approximately 7 cm in length and 4 cm at its largest diameter. It can generate up to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> of flow at a pressure of 100 mmHg. The axial flow design and absence of blood sac eliminates the need for venting of pulsatile volume (required for the first generation of implantable pumps), thus reducing the size of the percutaneous drive lead and also eliminating the need for internal one-way valves. Blood flows through an inflow cannula from the apex of the LV to the pump and returns back through an outflow cannula to the ascending aorta. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787867\"><span class=\"h2\">Jarvik 2000</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Jarvik 2000 is a continuous flow axial blood pump that has an intraventricular position, with the whole pump sitting within the LV cavity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86143\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86143 \">figure 3</a>). The pump weighs 85 g, measures 2.4 cm in diameter, and is 5.5 cm long. The single moving component is the impeller located in the center of the titanium housing. A brushless direct-current motor, contained within the housing, creates the electromagnetic force necessary to rotate the impeller. Blood flow is directed through the outlet graft by stator blades located near the pump outlet and it returns to either the ascending or descending aorta. The pump can generate up to a maximum of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> of flow. Pump implantation with the outflow cannula in the descending aorta can result in stasis and clot formation in the aortic root; to avoid this, an intermittent low speed controller can be used that drops the pump speed for eight seconds every minute to allow the aortic valve to open. Additionally, anastomosis of the cannula to the ascending aorta rather than the descending aorta results in fewer static complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Because this pump is not inserted in a pocket, serious pump infections are rare. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787874\"><span class=\"h2\">Berlin Heart INCOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Berlin Heart INCOR is a continuous flow axial flow pump marketed in Europe but not in the US. As blood passes into the INCOR it first passes an inducer that directs laminar flow onto the impeller, which is suspended by a magnetic bearing and floats free of contact with other parts. The impeller operates at speeds between 5000 and 10,000 rotations per minute. Blood is then directed to a stationary diffuser that has specially aligned blades that reduce the rotational effect of the blood flow and thus builds additional pressure which assists in the transport of blood through the outflow cannula to the aorta. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787888\"><span class=\"h1\">THIRD GENERATION PUMPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third generation VADs are centrifugal pumps that have been designed for their long durability, compact size, optimization of blood flow through the device to minimize the risk of thrombus formation and hemolysis, and simplified surgical implantation. Their durability is anticipated to be 5 to 10 years. The HeartWare and HeartMate 3 devices are discussed here. Smaller versions of the third generation devices are currently in development and undergoing animal testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22787897\"><span class=\"h2\">HeartWare</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HeartWare (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86144\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86144 \">figure 4</a>) is a continuous flow centrifugal third generation pump that is commercially available in Europe and the United States; in the United States, it was approved by the FDA as a bridge to transplantation in November 2012 and as destination therapy in September 2017. HeartWare has only one moving part, the impeller, and no mechanical bearings. Because the HeartWare pump has no bearings and runs at lower rpm, it is likely to have long durability. It is much smaller than earlier devices and easier to surgically implant.</p><p>The pump weighs 140 g and has an external diameter of 53 mm. The impeller spins at rates between 1800 and 4000 rpm and generates up to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> of blood flow. It is implantable directly adjacent to the heart in the pericardial space due to its small total size, equivalent to 50 cc. The impeller is suspended within the pump housing through a combination of passive magnets and a hydrodynamic thrust bearing.&nbsp;This hydrodynamic suspension is achieved by a gentle incline on the upper surfaces of the impeller blades. When the impeller spins, blood flows across these inclined surfaces, creating a &quot;cushion&quot; between the impeller and the pump housing. There is no contact between the impeller and the housing chamber. Device reliability is enhanced through the use of dual motor stators with independent drive circuitry, allowing a seamless transition between dual and single stator mode if required. The inflow cannula is integrated with the device itself, ensuring proximity between the heart and the pumping mechanism which facilitates implantation and ensures optimal blood flow characteristics.&nbsp;The impeller has a wide blade to help minimize risk of pump induced hemolysis or thrombus.</p><p>A randomized trial comparing the HeartWare centrifugal-flow device with the HeartMate II axial-flow device yielded mixed results. In the multicenter trial, 446 patients with advanced HF who were ineligible for cardiac transplantation were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to the study (HeartWare) device or the control (HeartMate II) device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary end point was survival at two years free from disabling stroke or device removal for malfunction or failure.

Patients in the control group had higher rates of device malfunction or device failure requiring replacement (16.2 versus 8.8 percent). A post-hoc analysis found that a recorded mean arterial blood pressure of higher than 90 mmHg was associated with a risk of stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improvements in functional status and quality of life were similar in the two treatment groups.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7778338\"><span class=\"h2\">HeartMate 3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HeartMate 3 is a fully levitated centrifugal-flow device that is inserted into the apex of the left ventricle. The HeartMate 3 is commercially available in Europe and the United States. The rotor spins at rates of 3000 to 9000 rpm and generates up to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> of blood flow. Although this is categorized as a continuous flow pump, it incorporates rapid changes in rotor speed to create an intrinsic artificial pump pulse (asynchronous with the native heart beat) to reduce stasis in the pump. The pump is capable of pumping up to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>. The mass of the HeartMate 3 is 475 g, including the motor (535 g), the inflow cannula, recovery section, outflow graft, bend relief, and all connecting hardware. The pump displaces 175 m. All of the wetted surfaces of the pump are titanium, except for the woven polyester grafts and the PTFE washers at joints. Most of the titanium surfaces were textured in the same way as the HeartMate and HeartMate II. The textured surface is intended to promote the development of a stable, adherent pseudoneointima immediately upon contact with blood, thereby insulating subsequent blood flow from contact with nonbiologic materials and reducing the risk of thromboembolism. The one component excluded from this process was the rotor, which was fabricated with smooth, polished surfaces. The rotor is passively magnetically levitated in the axial-translational and transverse-rotational degrees of freedom and actively magnetically levitated in the remaining degrees of freedom.

The SynCardia TAH is the only TAH system to receive FDA, CE, and Canadian Health approval for clinical implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The size of the artificial heart has restricted its use to patients with a large enough body habitus to accommodate positioning within the thoracic cavity. To be eligible for use of the SynCardia TAH, the patients must have a body-surface area of &gt;1.7 or a distance of &ge;10 cm from the 10<sup>th</sup> anterior vertebral body to the inner table of the sternum on computed tomographic scanning (CT). </p><p>The SynCardia TAH weighs 160 g and consists of two artificial ventricles, each made of semi-rigid polyurethane housing with four flexible polyurethane diaphragms separating the blood chambers from the air chambers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86145 \">figure 5</a>). The diaphragms enable the artificial ventricle to fill and then eject blood when compressed by air from the external console. Mechanical valves, mounted in the inflow (27 mm) and outflow (25 mm) ports of each artificial ventricle, control the direction of blood flow. The maximum dynamic stroke volume of each ventricle is 70 mL, which enables generation of a flow rate up to 9.5 L per minute. The left artificial ventricle is connected via the left atrial inflow connector to the left atrium, and via the aortic outflow cannula to the aorta. The right artificial ventricle is connected via the right atrial inflow connector to the right atrium and via the pulmonary artery outflow cannula to the pulmonary artery. Each artificial ventricle driveline conduit is tunneled through the chest wall. The right and left artificial ventricles are attached to seven-foot pneumatic drivelines that connect to the back of the external console. The external console weighs 180 kg and includes a monitoring computer that provides noninvasive diagnostic and monitoring information to the user, including device rates, dynamic stroke volumes, calculated cardiac outputs, drive pressure, flow waveforms, and trending information. Device status and patient related alarms (eg, low cardiac output) are also displayed on the console. Large SynCardia implant drivers are approved for use in the US, Canada, and Europe. A new portable console weighing 5.5 kg has received CE approval and is undergoing clinical trials for FDA approval. The SynCardia TAH was first implanted in a patient at the University of Arizona in 1988, and over 1600 patients have now been supported by the SynCardia TAH with the longest patient support being just over four years prior to successful heart transplantation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14205254\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164479067\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy is indicated in the following clinical settings: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy as a bridge to transplantation for selected patients with refractory heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) despite optimal pharmacologic and device treatment who are otherwise eligible or potentially eligible for heart transplantation and for whom a donor heart is not readily available.

Hence, LVADs can be used as a platform for myocardial recovery.
