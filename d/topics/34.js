Often when there is a hernia, organs or tissues that are normally held in place by the abdominal wall bulge or stick out through the weak or torn spot.</p><p>There are many different kinds of abdominal wall hernias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F87588\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87588 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3743958\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of abdominal wall hernias?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal wall hernias do not always cause symptoms. When they do, they can cause some or all of these symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bulge somewhere on the trunk of the body &ndash; This bulge can be so small that you don't even realize it's there.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, especially when coughing, straining, or using nearby muscles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pulling sensation around the bulge</p><p/><p>Abdominal wall hernias can balloon out and form a sac. That sac can end up holding a loop of intestine or a piece of fat that should normally be tucked inside the belly. This can be painful and even dangerous if the tissue in the hernia gets trapped and unable to slide back into the belly. When this happens, the tissue does not get enough blood, so it can become swollen or even die (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76003\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76003 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3743990\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See a doctor or nurse if you have any of the symptoms of a hernia. In most cases, doctors can diagnose a hernia just by doing an exam. During the exam, the doctor might ask you to cough or bear down while pressing on your hernia. This might be uncomfortable, but it is necessary to find the source of the problem.</p><p>Most of the time, the contents of the hernia can be &quot;reduced,&quot; or gently pushed back into the belly. Still, there are times when the hernia gets trapped and won't go back in. If that happens, the tissue that is trapped can get damaged.</p><p>If you develop pain around a hernia bulge or feel sick, call your doctor or surgeon right away. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3744005\"><span class=\"h1\">How are hernias treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all hernias need treatment right away. But many do need to be repaired with surgery. Surgeons can repair most hernias in 1 of 2 ways. The right surgery for you will depend on the size of your hernia, where on the abdominal wall it is, whether this is the first time it is getting repaired, and what your general health is like. The types of surgery are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open surgery &ndash; During an open surgery, the surgeon makes an incision near the hernia. Then he or she looks at the tissue that is stuck in the hernia, and if it is healthy, gently pushes it back into place. Sometimes a piece of tissue needs to be removed. Next, the surgeon sews the layers of the abdominal wall back together, so that nothing can bulge through. In some cases, surgeons will also patch the area with a piece of mesh. The mesh takes some of the strain off the abdominal wall. That way the hernia is less likely to happen again.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic surgery &ndash; During laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon makes a few incisions that are much smaller than those used in open surgery. Then he or she inserts long, thin tools into the area near the hernia. One of the tools has a camera (called a &quot;laparoscope&quot;) on the end, which sends pictures to a TV screen. The surgeon can look at the picture on the screen to guide his or her movements. Then he or she uses the long tools to repair the hernia using mesh.</p><p/><p>If your hernia has reduced the blood supply to a loop of intestine, your doctor might need to remove that piece of intestine. Then he or she will sew the intestine back together.</p><p>The recovery and aftercare for each type of hernia repair is different. Your doctor or nurse can tell you what to expect after your surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3744038\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-and-femoral-groin-hernias-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Inguinal and femoral (groin) hernias (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=groin-inguinal-hernias-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Groin (inguinal) hernias in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-hernia-of-the-diaphragm-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Congenital hernia of the diaphragm (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiatal-hernia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hiatal hernia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-bowel-obstruction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Small bowel obstruction (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
