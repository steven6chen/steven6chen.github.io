As awareness of human trafficking has evolved, victims have been found and freed from industries including agriculture, manufacturing, hospitality, health care, domestic service, and commercial sex work. The illegal nature of human trafficking makes it particularly difficult to identify and therefore aid victims. Health care providers have a unique opportunity to help trafficked persons as medical visits may be one of the few times these individuals are in contact with the world outside of those who exploit them.</p><p>This topic will review the identification, evaluation, and management of persons suspected of being trafficked.

Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude, or the removal of organs&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Risk factors can be identified in the individual, the individual's relationships, the community, and society at large. Of note, poverty increases the risk of trafficking at all four levels. Additional risk factors for being trafficked include young age (12- to 16-year-old girls are at greatest risk), <span class=\"nowrap\">ethnicity/minority</span> status, rural location, lack of education, disability, inadequate family support and protection, and migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Marginalized individuals are also at increased risk and include lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning persons; migrant workers; Native Americans; and indigenous people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]. At least one study suggests a history of abuse is a risk factor. In a survey study of nearly 200 female survivors of sex trafficking, approximately 60 percent reported physical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexual abuse prior to being trafficked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>However, while there are risk factors for trafficking, trafficking is not limited to any one group of individuals. Victims can be of any age, group, or status. In the United States, trafficked individuals come from all socioeconomic levels and include both citizens and noncitizens, documented and undocumented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1236516459\"><span class=\"h1\">HEALTH IMPACT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2577616849\"><span class=\"h2\">General</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For people who are trafficked, the experiences of recruitment, travel, detention and exploitation, and reintegration can negatively impact health and well-being and often have cumulative effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108417\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108417 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Victims rarely self-identify because of multiple factors including fear of the trafficker, distrust of authorities, feelings of shame and hopelessness, trauma bonds (ie, Stockholm syndrome), and threats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/20,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26</a>]. Threats used by traffickers can include acts of retribution against children or other family members, deportation, or criminal prosecution, in addition to psychological and physical harm. Further, some victims may not fully understand the nature of their situation and may not realize they are being trafficked because they receive housing, food, or clothing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similarly, when human trafficking is carried out under the guise of romance, trafficked persons may believe they are simply involved in a troubled romantic relationship and fail to recognize their exploitation.</p><p>In addition to being potentially dangerous, disclosure can also be emotionally difficult and is an act demonstrating significant courage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some victims may make two or more visits to a health care setting before deciding if they can safely reveal their situation. Lastly, discussing trafficking may be easier for the individual when the provider is of the same sex, ethnicity, or age range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1507166124\"><span class=\"h2\">Warning signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Red flags, indicators, and warning signs that a patient may be a victim of trafficking are described in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108340\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108340 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108607 \">table 3</a>). Providers should screen patients for potential trafficking when red flags emerge in the presentation, history, or physical examination. Health care providers are uniquely poised to identify human trafficking victims because they often present to emergency departments, reproductive health units, and family planning clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/21,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,28</a>]. In a retrospective survey of 173 survivors of trafficking in the United States, 68 percent were seen by a health care provider while trafficked, with 56 percent seeing emergency or urgent care providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Specific warning signs can often include late presentation, discrepancy between the verbal history and clinical findings, and signs an individual is being controlled (eg, not being able to carry one's own identification or not being allowed to answer questions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/2,30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,30-34</a>].</p><p>Warning signs specific to sex trafficking victims of any age or gender include reports of multiple sexual partners <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent or untreated sexually transmitted infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, sex trafficked women and girls typically report multiple pregnancies, miscarriages, or pregnancy terminations. Cases of sex trafficking may often appear, on the surface, to be instances of intimate partner violence (IPV).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1850443139\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We take a step-wise approach to the evaluation and treatment of patients with warning signs of human trafficking (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108343\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108343 \">algorithm 1</a>). The goal of the clinical visit is not to obtain a disclosure or carry out a rescue but rather to provide medical care and create a climate that allows &quot;every patient to feel safe, secure, cared for, validated, and empowered to disclose, if he or she so chooses&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Before beginning any conversation with a patient, the clinician should assess the potential safety risks that may result from asking the patient sensitive questions and ensure privacy for the patient. Interactions with potential trafficked patients should be honest and nonjudgmental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There is no consensus on the optimal content, length, or format of screening questions for identifying victims of human trafficking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Similar to interviewing victims of IPV, clinicians should not begin by asking outright if the individual has been beaten or retained against <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> will. Rather, the clinician should start with indirect questions that touch upon aspects of the patient's life, job, and general sense of safety. Suggested screening questions for adults and minors are listed in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108639\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108639 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108342\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108342 \">table 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4028892641\"><span class=\"h3\">Facilitate disclosure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Victims of trafficking do not often reveal their situation in clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients are more likely to disclose their experience of violence when [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/33,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providers use open-ended questions and are clearly listening.

If the victim does not feel prepared to disclose during the immediate clinical visit, disclosure may occur at a future visit. Therefore, each contact is a step on a potential pathway to safety for at-risk patients. Similar to patients for whom IPV is suspected but not acknowledged, clinicians should ask suspected victims of trafficking about their situation at every visit. For victims of IPV, some data suggest that patients are more likely to disclose information after they have been asked repeatedly in the health care setting about experiences of violence because the inquiries become normalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Thus, the clinician may want to schedule follow-up visits for any medical indication in order to bring the individual back into the health care setting and potentially access resources.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2282605265\"><span class=\"h3\">Confidentiality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confidentiality is critical for victims of human trafficking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-trafficking-identification-and-evaluation-in-the-health-care-setting/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Trafficked individuals and their families can be at risk if the victim tries to escape or to initiate reporting. Clinicians are advised to limit the number of staff who interact with the victim and ensure that all involved, including interpreters and advocates, understand that confidentiality is critically important for patient safety.

The hotline helps clinicians determine if they have encountered victims of human trafficking; identifies local, state, and federal resources; and helps arrange local social services to aid victims. Alternately, the Polaris Project operates a reporting text line. <strong>Text HELP or INFO to BeFree (233733)</strong>. (See <a href=\"#H3700717901\" class=\"local\">'Reporting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human trafficking is a form of slavery in which one person exerts control over another person for the purpose of exploitation. Human trafficking comprises sex and labor trafficking, forced criminality, and sale of human organs. Human trafficking does not require movement of the victim; many people are enslaved in their own communities or in cities within their country of origin. (See <a href=\"#H1674223225\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors include elements that drive or entice the individual toward trafficking. Risk factors can be identified in the individual, the individual's relationships, the community, and society at large. Of note, poverty increases the risk of trafficking at all four levels. (See <a href=\"#H191035201\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At every stage of the trafficking experience, adults and children can encounter abuse (psychological, physical, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sexual abuse); mandatory or coerced use of substances; social constraints; emotional manipulation; and economic exploitation, inescapable debts, and legal challenges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108419\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108419 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2577616849\" class=\"local\">'General'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A major challenge for health care providers is the difficulty in identifying victims. Victims rarely self-identify because of multiple factors including fear of the trafficker, distrust of authorities, feelings of shame and hopelessness, trauma bonds (ie, Stockholm syndrome), and threats. Providers should screen patients for potential trafficking when red flags emerge in the presentation, history, or physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108340\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108340 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108639\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108639 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H129764772\" class=\"local\">'Barriers to disclosure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific warning signs can often include late presentation for care, discrepancy between the verbal history and clinical findings, and signs an individual is being controlled (eg, not being able to carry one's own identification or not being allowed to answer questions). Additional warning signs are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108607 \">table 3</a>). Warning signs specific to sex trafficking include reports of multiple sexual partners, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancies, miscarriages, or pregnancy terminations. (See <a href=\"#H1507166124\" class=\"local\">'Warning signs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus regarding the optimal screening questions for identifying victims of human trafficking. The clinician should start with indirect questions that touch upon aspects of the patient's life, job, and general sense of safety. Suggested questions for adults and minors are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108639\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108639 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1850443139\" class=\"local\">'Approach to screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of a suspected or confirmed trafficking victim includes assessing acute medical needs and screening for medical conditions common in trafficked persons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108341\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108341 \">table 7</a>). Victims of sex trafficking have additional needs including forensic examination and evidence collection, treatment of sexually transmitted infections, possible pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV acquisition, and provision of emergency contraception or pregnancy care. (See <a href=\"#H2807193920\" class=\"local\">'Medical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinicians working with victims should provide trauma-informed care (TIC), also known as trauma-sensitive or trauma-aware care. The basic goals are to avoid reinjury, emphasize survivor strengths and resilience, aid healing and recovery, and promote the development of survivorship skills. A 16-minute online video is available from the <a href=\"https://polarisproject.adobeconnect.com/_a983384736/trauma-screenings/&amp;token=dR3woejQ+FhGunlg8qJYgof2eYkq62MnrChQmzUpb8e7oLvzdfqXibyorkBE5AinhNMCj9+FG3ad1+FeCxHkJW1UyG8litvdnF1wHXFbNGI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=106947\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NHTH</a> to educate providers on trauma-informed human trafficking screenings. (See <a href=\"#H2633203444\" class=\"local\">'Trauma-informed care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Written documentation should be recorded in an unbiased manner and include the language used directly by the patient. Wording that could be used against the patient is avoided (eg, prostitute or drug dealer). Prior to taking any photographs, the planned images are discussed with the patient and consent is obtained and documented. (See <a href=\"#H2191264118\" class=\"local\">'Tips for documentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians in many countries are required to report all cases of suspected or known child abuse, sexual or otherwise. However, laws vary across countries, states, and regions regarding the definition of suspected child abuse, personnel who are mandated to report, and the agency (or agencies) to which the report is made (eg, Child Protective Services, Department of Social Service, the local police department).
