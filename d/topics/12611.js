This results in an elevation of serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and other metabolic waste products that are normally excreted by the kidney.</p><p>The term AKI, rather than acute renal failure (ARF), is increasingly used by the nephrology community to refer to the acute loss of kidney function. This term also highlights that injury to the kidney that does not result in &quot;failure&quot; is also of great clinical significance. In this topic review, the acute loss of kidney function will be referred to as AKI.</p><p>The initial assessment of patients with AKI and management of the major complications of AKI are discussed here. The incidence, causes, diagnosis, and prevention of AKI are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kidney and patient outcomes after acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=possible-prevention-and-therapy-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Possible prevention and therapy of ischemic acute tubular necrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2271117744\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKI has multiple possible etiologies. Among hospitalized patients, AKI is most commonly due to either prerenal etiologies (volume depletion, &quot;third<sup> </sup>spacing,&quot; effective volume depletion from heart failure or cirrhosis) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from ischemia, nephrotoxin exposure, or sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pathogenesis of ATN is discussed elsewhere.

The pathogeneses of these disorders are also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-classification-and-treatment-of-rapidly-progressive-crescentic-glomerulonephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the classification and treatment of rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-interstitial-nephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4054704015\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK SCORE FOR PREDICTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of risk scores for prediction of AKI in various clinical settings have been developed. A risk score for AKI (defined as an increase in the creatinine of &ge;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> within 48 hours or 50 percent increase within seven days) among critically ill patients has been developed and validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Using data from a prospective cohort of 573 patients, independent predictors of AKI within 48 hours of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) were identified and used to develop a risk prediction score:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) &ndash; 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic liver disease &ndash; 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart failure &ndash; 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension &ndash; 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary heart disease &ndash; 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>pH &lt;7.3 &ndash; 3 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrotoxin exposure &ndash; 3 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe <span class=\"nowrap\">infection/sepsis</span> &ndash; 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation &ndash; 2 points</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia &ndash; 1 point</p><p/><p>The risk prediction model was tested in an additional cohort of 144 patients and independently validated among 1300 consecutive ICU patients. Using a threshold &ge;5 to define high-risk individuals, the positive and negative predictive values in the validation cohort were 32 and 95, respectively. Thus, using this model, 32 percent of patients with score &ge;5 points are likely to develop AKI within 48 hours; 95 percent of patients with score &lt;5 percent are unlikely to develop AKI.</p><p>The operating characteristics of this risk score are similar to others in that the positive predictive capability is low to moderate while the negative predictive value is very high. These risk scores are helpful in situations where the potential nephrotoxic insult is high and is anticipated (such as prior to coronary surgery or angiography or contrast dye administration). In these settings, such scores allow for identification of risk stratification and implementation of specific risk reduction programs targeting those patients at highest risk.</p><p>However, data are not provided in this study about severity or cause of ensuing AKI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6569987\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKI is generally detected by an increase in the serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a decrease in urine output. The magnitude of the increase in creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decrease in urine output that is required to establish a diagnosis of AKI has been the focus of multiple expert consensus groups. The purpose of establishing a precise definition of AKI is to allow better interpretation of epidemiologic and clinical studies and to identify potential therapies. In addition, it is now recognized that even small increases in serum creatinine (&gt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> can have important prognostic implications and are clinically relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The potential limitations of the different consensus criteria that have been proposed are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging criteria of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2271118042\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION AFTER DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among many patients, AKI is mild and is manifested only by a transient increase in the serum creatinine or fall in urine output. However, AKI can cause life-threatening complications, even among those with relatively less severe disease. In addition, the serum creatinine will not accurately reflect the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients who are not in steady state. Thus, among patients who have just developed AKI and in whom the serum creatinine is actively increasing, the estimated GFR (eGFR), based upon the serum creatinine, will overestimate the actual GFR. Conversely, among patients who are recovering from AKI, the eGFR may underestimate the actual GFR. In order to address this non-steady state phenomena of serum creatinine, a kinetic GFR evaluation formula can be utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>All patients who present with AKI must be carefully evaluated both for reversible causes, such as hypotension, volume depletion, or obstruction, and for the presence of complications such as hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and volume overload (see <a href=\"#H6569994\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below). The initial evaluation of the patient with AKI is directed at determining the cause, removing any active insults, minimizing new injury, and identifying the complications that may require immediate attention.</p><p>The diagnostic evaluation to determine the cause of AKI is discussed elsewhere. The use of urinary and serum biomarkers of kidney injury and their evolving roles are also discussed in these sections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The major complications of AKI include volume overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia. With severe forms, mental status changes may be present. Hyperuricemia and hypermagnesemia may also occur. The initial assessment therefore should include the careful evaluation of volume status and measurement of serum electrolytes, particularly potassium and bicarbonate, and serum phosphate, calcium, and albumin. We also check serum uric acid, magnesium, and a complete blood count. As these patients are often unstable and critically ill, we recommend careful attention to serial measurement of these values as well as meticulous measurement of fluid balance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6569994\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6570002\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of life-threatening fluid and electrolyte abnormalities due to AKI should be started immediately. Complications of AKI include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid overload</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperkalemia (serum potassium &gt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> or a rapidly increasing serum potassium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of uremia, such as pericarditis, or an otherwise unexplained decline in mental status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe metabolic acidosis (pH &lt;7.1)</p><p/><p>Patients with any of these complications despite appropriate medical therapy generally require urgent dialysis. However, since hemodialysis often cannot be immediately provided, such patients usually require medical treatment during the period prior to the initiation of hemodialysis. Appropriate measures are discussed in sections below or in other topic reviews, to which links are provided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6570009\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An assessment of volume status is performed in all patients who present with AKI since correction of volume depletion or volume overload (especially when associated with worsening cardiac output) may reverse or ameliorate AKI. Retrospective data have shown that even small degrees of fluid overload are associated with poor outcomes and increased risk of mortality. Thus, fluid therapy should be used with careful attention to net fluid balance and avoiding overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiorenal syndrome: Definition, prevalence, diagnosis, and pathophysiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiorenal syndrome: Prognosis and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6570016\"><span class=\"h3\">Volume depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unless contraindicated, the patient with a clinical history consistent with fluid loss (such as vomiting and diarrhea), a physical examination consistent with hypovolemia (hypotension and tachycardia), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oliguria should be administered intravenous fluid therapy. This fluid challenge attempts to identify prerenal failure that can progress to AKI if not treated promptly. Studies have shown that prompt reversal of volume depletion may prevent or limit kidney injury due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This is especially true for certain etiologies such as rhabdomyolysis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crush-related-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Crush-related acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a>). However, such fluid infusion is contraindicated in those with obvious intravascular volume overload. In certain patients, such as those with systolic or diastolic heart failure, cirrhosis, or the nephrotic syndrome, patients may appear to be volume overloaded but have low effective circulating volume and may respond with increased urine output after fluid therapy. In unclear cases, central hemodynamic measurements that assess volume responsiveness may be helpful.</p><p>Fluids may be either crystalloid or colloid. Crystalloid solutions, such as isotonic saline, are preferred for initial therapy since studies have shown that colloid solutions provide no additional benefit and are more expensive (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Colloid versus crystalloid'</a>). Potassium-containing crystalloid solutions, such as lactated Ringer's solution, should be used with caution since the kidney may not be able to excrete potassium and hyperkalemia may result. There continues to be much debate as to which intravenous fluid should be administered since large volumes of normal saline may result in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and a more pH-balanced solution may be of greater benefit (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Buffered crystalloid versus isotonic saline'</a>). However, randomized, controlled trials have not demonstrated the superiority of balanced solutions over chloride-rich solutions such as 0.9 percent saline, and this debate continues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The overall goal of fluid therapy is to increase cardiac output and improve tissue oxygenation in patients who are preload dependent or volume responsive. Administering fluids in patients who are non-volume responsive is detrimental and should be avoided. Fluids should be targeted to physiologic endpoints such as mean arterial pressure or urine output or, among patients in whom invasive monitoring is utilized, to dynamic changes in cardiac output. The optimal infusion rate varies depending on the clinical status and comorbidities of the patient. Overly aggressive volume repletion should be avoided as excessive volume expansion may lead to pulmonary congestion, especially in septic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. We suggest judicious administration, beginning with 1 to 3 liters of fluid, with careful and repeated clinical assessment to assess the patient's response to this therapy. In some cases, additional fluid therapy may be necessary (eg, severe burns, acute pancreatitis). In critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients, mini-fluid boluses (100 mL) may demonstrate fluid responsiveness by increase in strove volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] while minimizing the potential for fluid overload associated with large continuous fluid administration.</p><p>The total amount of administered volume depends upon the degree of volume depletion on presentation and on ongoing losses. The restoration of adequate urine flow and improvement in renal function with fluid resuscitation is consistent with a diagnosis of prerenal disease. Patients who do not respond to administered volume with an increase in urine output or decrease in the serum creatinine are unlikely to have prerenal disease and more likely to have established ATN or other forms of intrinsic AKI such as acute or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis or acute interstitial nephritis. However, volume status may be difficult to assess among some patients, and prerenal disease may not be reliably excluded after the initial administration of fluid: Among selected patients in whom urine output is not restored with administered volume, invasive monitoring may be required to adequately assess the patient's fluid status and help guide further therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with relatively mild volume depletion may not have an obvious history of volume loss. In addition, less severe volume depletion is difficult to accurately detect on clinical examination, especially in older patients. In this setting, AKI may still be reversed, at least in part, by fluid administration. Thus, in the absence of overt volume depletion, we frequently administer intravenous saline at a variable rate based upon clinical status. Although no consensus exists to guide therapy, among hemodynamically stable patients who do not have overt evidence of volume depletion, we administer 75 to 100 mL per hour for a total of 1 to 3 liters. If this approach is undertaken, the patient's clinical status must be closely monitored to ensure that volume overload does not occur and that the rate of administration is sufficient to keep up with ongoing fluid losses. Once again, fluid therapy should be targeted to physiologic endpoints.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6570023\"><span class=\"h3\">Volume overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypervolemia may be present upon initial evaluation or occur due to excessive fluid administration in the setting of impaired ability to excrete sodium and water. This is especially true for patients with sepsis who commonly receive aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Intravenous fluids (first three hours)'</a>.)</p><p>Daily fluid balance is commonly positive in critically ill patients with ATN as a result of obligate fluid intake due to the administration of antibiotics, blood products, other intravenous medications, and nutritional support. This may result in progressive volume expansion and pulmonary edema, which may be especially poorly tolerated in patients with acute lung injury and which is associated with poor outcomes.</p><p>Less commonly, volume overload may result from primary left ventricular dysfunction and cause AKI or type 1 cardiorenal syndrome. The diagnosis and treatment of cardiorenal syndrome are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiorenal-syndrome-definition-prevalence-diagnosis-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiorenal syndrome: Definition, prevalence, diagnosis, and pathophysiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiorenal-syndrome-prognosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiorenal syndrome: Prognosis and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diuretics may be used to relieve hypervolemia among patients with AKI. In a post-hoc analysis of data from a multicenter, randomized trial that compared liberal versus conservative fluid management among patients with acute lung injury, a positive fluid balance was associated with mortality among 306 patients who developed AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A higher <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> dose was associated with decreased mortality, but this effect was not significant after adjusting for fluid balance. The full results of this trial are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-supportive-care-and-oxygenation-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Supportive care and oxygenation in adults&quot;, section on 'Fluid management'</a>.)</p><p>However, we generally do not use diuretics for prolonged therapy or to postpone the initiation of dialysis, since dialysis and ultrafiltration offer the most efficient method of volume removal in patients with AKI from any cause and allow clinicians to optimize nutritional support and the use of intravenous medications. However, although several observational studies have demonstrated an association between the severity of volume overload at the time of initiation of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>], the benefit of early initiation of dialysis for volume management remains uncertain (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults-indications-timing-and-dialysis-dose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury in adults: Indications, timing, and dialysis dose&quot;</a>). If diuretics are used to treat volume overload, then the patient should be regularly assessed to see if urine output responds. If there is no increase in urine output, then alternative therapies such as dialysis should be initiated.</p><p>If diuretics are used as temporizing agents to relieve volume overload, loop diuretics are the preferred agents as they provide a greater natriuretic effect than thiazide diuretics. We often start with 40 to 80 mg of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>. The dose of loop diuretics can be titrated upward to assess for responsiveness, and a thiazide diuretic can be added to augment diuresis. As mentioned above, if there is minimal response to high-dose loop diuretics (&gt;80 to 120 mg of furosemide) combined with a thiazide diuretic, then <span class=\"nowrap\">dialysis/ultrafiltration</span> should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Thiazide plus loop diuretics'</a>.)</p><p>Among hospitalized patients, diuretics are generally given intravenously rather than orally since the absorption of oral agents is variable in patients with decreased intestinal perfusion and motility and in those with mucosal edema. The optimal diuretic dose and regimen are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Basic principles of diuretic dosing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6570030\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially life-threatening complication of AKI. It is especially prevalent in oliguric patients who are catabolic or have evidence of active cellular breakdown, such as rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome.</p><p>There are very few symptoms or signs of hyperkalemia, and these tend to occur only with very high serum potassium levels and are related to impaired neuromuscular transmission and cardiac conduction abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, all patients with AKI and hyperkalemia that is refractory to medical therapy should be dialyzed unless hyperkalemia is mild (ie, &le;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and the cause of AKI is known to be easily reversed (such as prerenal AKI due to volume depletion or angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors).</p><p>Among patients who require dialysis, medical therapy of hyperkalemia is often required while dialysis is being arranged. Immediate therapy is warranted if electrocardiographic changes or peripheral neuromuscular abnormalities are present, regardless of the degree of hyperkalemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Specific treatment of hyperkalemia is directed at antagonizing the membrane effects of potassium, driving extracellular potassium into the cells, or removing excess potassium from the body.</p><p>The indications for specific medical therapies are discussed at length elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We do not dialyze, at least initially, patients with mild hyperkalemia and AKI that is from a known reversible cause (such as volume depletion or an ACE <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/angiotensin</span> receptor blocker [ARB]). We treat such patients with a low-potassium diet and volume administration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor or ARB. Such patients should be followed closely to make certain that such conservative therapy is effective.</p><p>We also do not dialyze, at least initially, patients who have AKI from a cause that is not readily reversible, such as ATN, and who have hyperkalemia that is adequately treated with medical therapy. However, depending upon other variables (such as the time of day and available medical staff), preparations for dialysis, such as placement of a dialysis catheter, may be considered for such patients since hyperkalemia is likely to recur unless renal function recovers. This is especially true among patients who are oliguric or anuric, but the approach must be individualized for each patient.</p><p>In all patients with AKI, potassium in infusions and medications should be avoided as much as possible. Dietary potassium intake should be restricted to approximately 2 grams daily. Oral potassium binding resins can be considered in mild hyperkalemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>). Patients who have severe hyperkalemia (defined as K &gt;6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> or rapidly rising serum potassium should not receive any dietary potassium until hyperkalemia can be addressed (either by dialysis or medical therapy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6570037\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The excretion of acid and regeneration of bicarbonate is impaired in the setting of a low glomerular filtration rate (GFR) resulting in metabolic acidosis. Much of the acid that is normally excreted by the kidney is the product of daily metabolism. However, other factors usually contribute to severe acidosis among patients with AKI, who are often critically ill. For example, patients with AKI due to sepsis, trauma, and multi-organ failure often have increased production of lactic acid or ketoacids. Other patients who present with AKI may have metabolic acidosis resulting from loss of bicarbonate or from diarrhea or, less commonly, renal tubular acidosis. In addition, administration of large amounts of chloride-rich solutions such as 0.9 percent saline may lead to a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.</p><p>Commonly used treatments for metabolic acidosis include dialysis and bicarbonate administration. Among patients with AKI, the choice of therapy depends upon the absence or presence of volume overload and the underlying cause and severity of the acidosis.</p><p>We dialyze patients with severe oligo-anuric AKI who are volume overloaded and have severe metabolic acidosis (a pH &lt;7.1) regardless of the cause of acidosis. Physiologic studies have suggested that this degree of acidemia may produce hemodynamic instability related to reduced left ventricular contractility, arrhythmias, arterial vasodilation and venoconstriction, and impaired responsiveness to catecholamine vasopressors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/13-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-20</a>]. Dialysis is preferred to the administration of bicarbonate among patients who are volume overloaded because bicarbonate administration results in a large sodium load that may cause or contribute to volume overload. Even among patients who are not volume overloaded on exam, bicarbonate may cause volume overload among patients who are oliguric or anuric and should be used cautiously.</p><p>In general, we also dialyze patients with AKI and organic acidosis (ie, lactic or ketoacidosis) and pH &lt;7.1, even if they are not volume overloaded and especially if they are oliguric or anuric since such patients are at risk for becoming volume overloaded with bicarbonate therapy.</p><p>However, among patients with AKI who are not volume overloaded and have no other indication for acute dialysis, bicarbonate may be administered instead of dialysis in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-anion gap acidosis related to diarrhea or other etiologies.

The treatment of such patients is primarily directed at reversing the underlying causes of excessive acid production. This includes the treatment of sepsis and the optimization of ventilation and tissue perfusion to minimize lactic acid production and the administration of insulin to patients who have diabetic ketoacidosis. Exogenous sources of acids (such as salicylates) should be removed. The use of bicarbonate is controversial among such patients.

Again, the infusion of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride produced similar changes in cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, and pulmonary artery pressure.</p><p/><p>These two trials were too small to detect a minor benefit of bicarbonate therapy; in addition, patients with severe acidemia were not represented. Thus, we and other experts continue to use bicarbonate therapy in patients who have an arterial pH &lt;7.1. However, bicarbonate therapy requires adequate ventilation, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicarbonate-therapy-in-lactic-acidosis#H12631806\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bicarbonate therapy in lactic acidosis&quot;, section on 'Potential harms of bicarbonate and alternative agents'</a>.)</p><p>Among patients who are receiving bicarbonate for the treatment of severe organic acidosis, we initiate dialysis for those who have an ongoing and increasing demand for bicarbonate to maintain pH despite administered bicarbonate, even if volume overload is not present. However, there are no published data to suggest that a survival benefit is associated with this approach. Thus, some clinicians would favor continuing bicarbonate administration, providing there are no other indications for dialysis, and some would favor just treating the underlying disease process that caused the acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicarbonate-therapy-in-lactic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bicarbonate therapy in lactic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with AKI, bicarbonate administration may be associated with serious side effects. Bicarbonate administration may cause a decrease in the level of ionized or free calcium because of a pH-dependent increase in the binding of calcium to albumin. This could cause or worsen the symptoms of hypocalcemia since symptoms of hypocalcemia reflect from the ionized, not total, calcium. (See <a href=\"#H6570685\" class=\"local\">'Hypocalcemia'</a> below.)</p><p>As in patients without AKI, bicarbonate administration could cause hypernatremia, an increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pC02) among patients with circulatory or ventilatory compromise, and increased intracranial pressure in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Hypocalcemia is common among such patients and is primarily related to increases in serum phosphorus levels caused by reduced GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Other contributors to hypocalcemia include skeletal resistance to parathyroid hormone and decreased synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The serum ionized calcium should be measured in addition to the total serum calcium if a laboratory known to reliably measure ionized calcium is available. The total serum calcium concentration does not accurately reflect the ionized calcium concentration among patients with low- or high-serum albumin levels, since calcium is bound to albumin. In addition, since the binding of calcium to albumin is pH dependent, the amount of free calcium may be altered by acid-base disorders or by the rapid correction of such disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to hypocalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of hypocalcemia depends on the severity and presence of symptoms. If the patient is asymptomatic and hyperphosphatemia is present, initial therapy is the correction of hyperphosphatemia. The reduction of serum phosphate as a result of treatment with oral phosphate binders is often sufficient to improve the serum calcium. (See <a href=\"#H6570714\" class=\"local\">'Hyperphosphatemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Symptomatic patients should be more aggressively treated with intravenous calcium (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypocalcemia&quot;</a>). However, the administration of calcium to patients who are severely hyperphosphatemic may result in the deposition of calcium phosphate into vasculature and organs. Patients with symptomatic hypocalcemia in the presence of serum phosphorus levels &gt;8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.6 to 3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> should be dialyzed to correct both hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. Among such patients, we generally use high-calcium dialysate.</p><p>Occasionally, patients will develop life-threatening symptoms of hypocalcemia while awaiting dialysis. This is especially true for patients with tumor lysis syndrome. Such patients should be treated with intermittent intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a>, even though there is a risk of metastatic calcification associated with such therapy. We treat with intravenous calcium patients with symptoms of hypocalcemia including paresthesias, tetany (especially carpopedal spasm), confusion, seizures, Trousseau&rsquo;s sign (carpal spasm occurring after the occlusion of the brachial artery with a blood pressure cuff for three minutes), Chvostek&rsquo;s sign (contraction of the facial muscle in response to tapping the facial nerve anterior to the ear), or QT prolongation. Initially, intravenous calcium (1 to 2 g of calcium gluconate, equivalent to 90 to 180 mg elemental calcium, in 50 mL of 5 percent dextrose) can be infused over 10 to 20 minutes. The calcium should not be given more rapidly, because of the risk of serious cardiac dysfunction, including systolic arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This dose of calcium gluconate will raise the serum calcium concentration for only two or three hours while arrangements for dialysis are made. Either 10 percent calcium gluconate (90 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) or 10 percent calcium chloride (270 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) can be used to prepare the infusion solution. Calcium gluconate is usually preferred because it is less likely to cause tissue necrosis if extravasated.
