High blood pressure puts you at risk for heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>&quot;C&quot; stands for &quot;cholesterol&quot;</strong> &ndash; Cholesterol is a waxy substance found in the blood. High cholesterol is another factor that increases your risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious problems.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1730387714\"><span class=\"h1\">Why are my ABCs so important?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with people who do not have diabetes, people who have diabetes are 2 to 3 times more likely to have a heart attack or a stroke. People with diabetes also have heart attacks at a younger age, and that are more severe and more deadly. Plus, people with diabetes are much more likely to get kidney disease. By keeping your ABCs under control, you can lower your risk of these problems by a lot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1730387721\"><span class=\"h1\">Isn't my blood sugar the most important thing?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Keeping blood sugar low is important in preventing some problems caused by diabetes, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye diseases that lead to vision loss or blindness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve damage (called &quot;neuropathy&quot;) that can cause numbness or pain in the hands and feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The need to have toes, fingers, or other body parts removed by surgery (amputated)</p><p/><p>Even so, blood sugar is just one of the things that should get your attention. That's because the problems caused by high blood pressure and high cholesterol are often more serious than the ones caused by high blood sugar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1730387728\"><span class=\"h1\">What should my ABC levels be?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The levels you should aim for will depend on how severe your diabetes is, how old you are, and what other health problems you have. Ask your doctor or nurse what your target levels should be.</p><p>Many people with diabetes aim for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A1C levels below 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood pressure below <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90,</span> or lower in some cases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LDL cholesterol level below 100 (LDL is one type of cholesterol, often called the &quot;bad cholesterol&quot; or &quot;lousy cholesterol&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1730387735\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I control my ABCs?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You and your doctor will work together to create a plan to keep your ABCs under control. Your plan might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; Most people with diabetes take medicine every day to control their blood sugar. They might also need to check their blood sugar level every day. Plus, many people with diabetes need medicines every day to treat high blood pressure or high cholesterol, or to prevent future health problems. If you have any problems with your medicines, or you cannot afford them, talk to your doctor or nurse about these issues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lifestyle changes</strong> &ndash; Choices you make every day about the foods you eat and the way you live can have a big impact on your ABCs and your general health. Here are some things you can do to help keep your ABCs under control or reduce your health risks:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Make healthy food choices &ndash; Eat lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products. Limit the amount of meat and fried or fatty foods that you eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Be active &ndash; Walk, garden, or do something active for 30 minutes or more on most days of the week.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stop smoking &ndash; Smoking increases the chance that you will have a heart attack or stroke, or develop cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lose weight &ndash; Being overweight increases the risk of many health problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid alcohol &ndash; Alcohol can increase blood sugar and blood pressure.</p><p/><p>Luckily, many of the lifestyle changes above can improve all 3 of the ABCs. For instance, being active and losing weight can help control blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82356\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82356 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1730387742\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-and-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diabetes and diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-during-pregnancy-for-women-with-type-1-or-type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Care during pregnancy for women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-damage-caused-by-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nerve damage caused by diabetes (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preventing complications in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-neuropathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetic neuropathy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-mellitus-and-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes mellitus and diet (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=foot-care-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Foot care in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
