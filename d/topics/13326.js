Reactions that begin within minutes to one hour of administration are classified as &quot;immediate.&quot; Although there are exceptions, this definition captures the majority of type I, immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>). Signs and symptoms of immediate reactions include flushing, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, and hypotension and shock. An array of symptoms may be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F100732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100732 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-allergy-immediate-reactions#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin allergy: Immediate reactions&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H887308111\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF SKIN TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing is a bioassay performed on the skin, which detects the presence of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) on a patient's mast cells. When allergen is introduced into the skin of a patient during skin testing, it comes into contact with cutaneous mast cells. Binding of the allergen occurs if the patient's mast cells are coated with IgE recognizing that specific allergen. If both IgE and allergen are present in sufficient quantities, then adjacent allergen-specific IgE molecules become cross-linked on the mast cell surface, and the cells are activated.</p><p>Mast cell activation results in a positive skin test, which is a transient &quot;wheal-and-flare&quot; reaction within 15 to 20 minutes from application of the allergen. Patients with detectable penicillin-specific IgE on their mast cells are said to be &quot;sensitized&quot; to penicillin and are at high risk for an immediate allergic reaction to the drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1537236018\"><span class=\"h1\">REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systematically, skin testing patients who have a history of penicillin allergy reveals that most patients are not actually allergic or have lost the allergy over time. Reintroducing penicillin as a treatment option can decrease antibiotic costs, optimize antibiotic choices, and reduce patient complications associated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as infections with vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, as discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-antibiotics-in-penicillin-allergic-hospitalized-patients#H889002390\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of antibiotics in penicillin-allergic hospitalized patients&quot;, section on 'Impact of penicillin allergy on care'</a>.)</p><p>Penicillin skin testing should be performed only by specifically trained personnel, usually allergy specialists, because any procedure that involves the deliberate exposure of a patient to a substance to which <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> may be allergic should be undertaken by someone with expertise in that technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22604319\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing is the most rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective testing modality for evaluating patients with immediate allergic reactions to penicillin and related drugs. It is recommended by the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/pdfs/penicillin-factsheet.pdf&amp;token=8hQyJ8AVSlM/reJEP14loGoXrDoRq2dEoxr9ndmIs0vaTjELBVDOE1vvUYkYa5widgPQFAggPEGdWoYdnYPlfp504u4HLADtyceISu3JHhA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=16503\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> to reduce the unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Penicillin skin testing is the best method for detecting patients at risk for penicillin-induced anaphylaxis, because it is more sensitive than in vitro tests for penicillin-specific IgE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the results are most likely to be positive in patients with immediate reactions, skin testing is also useful in excluding immediate reactions in patients with unclear histories of past penicillin reactions, such as isolated urticaria, isolated angioedema, or unspecified rash. Skin testing has no role in the diagnosis of blistering skin reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), or in reactions that are caused by other known mechanisms (eg, hemolytic anemia, interstitial nephritis).</p><p>Skin testing is ideally performed when the patient is well and not in urgent or immediate need of antibiotic therapy. The indications for penicillin skin testing are evolving, with a trend for testing more patients even if they have alternatives to penicillin or beta-lactam therapy. Penicillin skin testing was traditionally reserved for patients who required penicillins because there was no other suitable antibiotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], a situation that has become increasingly uncommon. However, alternative antibiotics are often less effective, more toxic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> more expensive than available penicillins. In addition, it is important to avoid unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H668928\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to penicillin skin testing are similar to those for other forms of skin testing, which are mentioned briefly here and discussed in more detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain skin conditions (chronic urticaria, dermatographism) in which the skin is over-reactive and false-positive results may occur if not properly controlled for.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inability to temporarily discontinue medications that either interfere with skin test interpretation or inhibit the clinician's ability to treat anaphylaxis should it occur as a result of testing (which is rare).

Systemic allergic reactions are more likely with intradermal testing because more allergen is introduced into the skin. Fatal anaphylaxis in response to testing has not been reported since modern skin testing methods have been in use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Skin testing has been safely performed in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], as well as in critically-ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22604333\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penicillin skin testing results are obtained in less than one hour with minimal patient discomfort. Skin testing is valid in both adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The standard skin testing procedure involves two steps. Epicutaneous (prick-puncture) skin testing should be performed first and if negative, followed by intradermal (or intracutaneous) testing. In a study of 642 patients with delayed or unclear reaction histories, only intradermal penicillin skin testing (without prior prick testing) was performed, and no systemic reactions were observed. However, omission of prick testing warrants further research before becoming a standard of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2466840\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following factors should be considered when planning penicillin skin testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing should not be performed in the weeks immediately following an episode of anaphylaxis, because during this type of severe allergic reaction, there is massive activation of mast cells, and the cells may then be hyporeactive for a period of time. It is customary to allow a period of at least four weeks to elapse after anaphylaxis before any skin testing is performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Recent anaphylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's medications should be reviewed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Any medications that could interfere with the results of skin testing (eg, antihistamines) should be temporarily discontinued, if possible. The duration that various medications should be withheld is reviewed separately.

If possible, these medications may be held temporarily (particularly in patients with extremely severe reaction histories) or this may not be necessary since most patients are very unlikely to develop anaphylaxis as a result of skin testing.

The majority of patients are allergic to degradation products of penicillin covalently linked to self-proteins. Thus, skin testing with a simple solution of the drug as it is normally administered is not adequate to identify allergy in most patients. Insight into the immunochemistry of penicillin allowed for the development of skin testing reagents to detect penicillin-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67647\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67647 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Penicillin skin testing is usually performed with the following reagents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58347 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major determinant</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicilloyl-polylysine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Penicilloyl-polylysine</a> (PPL) (Pre-Pen) (6 x 10<sup>-5</sup> M)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minor determinants:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Penicillin G</a> (10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Penicilloate (if available) (0.01 M)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Penilloate (if available) (0.01 M)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ampicillin</a> and or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> (3 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> if relevant to the patient's care</p><p/><p>The minimal reagents required are positive and negative controls, the major determinant (PPL) and the minor determinant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a>.

The recommendation to test in duplicate comes from a single large study in which 7 percent of duplicate tests were discordant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If a single intradermal test result is equivocal, it should be repeated in duplicate.</p><p>The package insert for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> potassium states that after reconstitution of the vial from the powder form, the full-strength solution (eg, 1 million <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> can be stored and used for one week if refrigerated.

Penicilloyl is the major determinant, and when complexed to polylysine, it constitutes a multivalent skin test reagent known as PPL. PPL is important for reliable skin testing, as up to 75 percent of penicillin skin test-positive patients react only to PPL, depending on the population studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/3,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,14</a>]. Hence, skin testing without PPL may fail to identify many penicillin-allergic individuals and is not recommended.</p><p>Of note, the percentage of patients reacting only to PPL appears to be lower in European populations compared with North American patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One potential explanation for this is the higher prevalence of patients selectively allergic to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a></span> in Europe. Despite geographic and perhaps temporal differences in the prevalence of unique PPL sensitivity, use of PPL in penicillin skin testing is essential to maximize clinical sensitivity.</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>PPL is commercially available as Pre-Pen. This product was not available in the United States for several years, but its production was resumed in late 2009.

Of these, only penicillin G is available commercially.</p><p>Standard intravenous preparations of benzylpenicillin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a>) may be used for skin testing at a concentration of 10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58347 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Benzylpenicilloate and benzylpenilloate (also known as MDM) are not commercially available (except for a product for use in Spain and South America), but the importance of these reagents is controversial. In large scale studies, about 10 percent of penicillin skin test-positive patients are positive only to penicilloate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> penilloate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/3,13,14,16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,14,16-21</a>]. One small study suggested that patients who tested positive only to the MDMs were at higher risk for severe allergic reactions. However, larger studies found that the negative predictive value of skin testing with PPL plus MDM was similar to that of PPL plus benzylpenicillin alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/4,8,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,22-24</a>]. Stated differently, although patients exist who only test positive to MDM, challenges of patients skin test-negative to PPL and benzylpenicillin had similar reaction rates compared with patients skin test-negative to the full set of major and minor penicillin determinants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/3,18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18,25</a>]. However, these studies had insufficient power to detect a small difference in rates. Thus, the presumed clinical value of the MDM as a skin testing reagent compared with benzylpenicillin alone is based on the observation that a few more patients with positive skin tests will be detected using the full skin test battery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58347\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58347 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Although the recommended approach is to include PPL in skin testing of all patients, one study retrospectively evaluated the utility of testing with only the minor determinant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> during a three-year period when PPL was not commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The study population consisted of children with past allergic reactions (immediate or nonsevere-delayed) to any penicillin drug (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>), of whom 89 percent had reacted to amoxicillin. They were tested with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G), and if negative, challenged with a three-step protocol using the penicillin that caused the original reaction (ie, amoxicillin in most cases). Positive skin test results were obtained in 33 percent, which is much higher than in most studies, and those children were not challenged. Of the 378 children with negative skin test results, all but three were challenged, and 18 reacted (4.8 percent), yielding a negative predictive value for testing with penicillin G alone of 95 percent in that population (95% CI, 93-97 percent). However, these findings are different from those of many previous studies and require confirmation in other populations before the importance of PPL is questioned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22605979\"><span class=\"h3\">Aminopenicillins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aminopenicillins, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, should be included in the skin testing panel for any patient who reports an immediate systemic reaction to these drugs. Patients who are selectively allergic to the aminopenicillins form IgE antibodies which recognize, at least in part, the side R-group side chain rather than the core penicilloyl determinant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/25,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27-30</a>].

This approach will detect the majority of patients who are allergic to amoxicillin. However, the clinician should be aware that it is possible to be selectively allergic to amoxicillin and not ampicillin (and vice versa), since the structures are similar but not identical.

Although skin testing to clavulanate alone (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL)</span> is more sensitive than testing with the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate, obtaining clavulanate for testing is extremely difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22604340\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive reaction consists of a central area of superficial skin edema (wheal) surrounded by erythema (flare). The site is usually pruritic. This reaction represents the immediate phase of the allergic reaction. If the patient's cutaneous mast cells are not activated, then no edema or erythema develops, and the test is negative. Falsely-negative skin tests can result when patients have received medications, such as antihistamines, that block the skin effects of immediate mast cell mediators.

In addition, drug-specific IgE is believed to be a necessary but not always sufficient factor for a symptomatic drug reaction. Most available data suggest that approximately 50 percent (range 33 to 100 percent) of penicillin skin test-positive patients develop immediate allergic reactions upon being challenged with penicillin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/4,18,19,25,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18,19,25,38-41</a>]. This rate is comparable with that observed in Hymenoptera allergy skin testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Two outlier studies from the same group of researchers reported positive predictive values of 10 and 7 percent, and the reasons for the much lower values are unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/12,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,43</a>].</p><p>Patients who test positive to penicillin should avoid all penicillins (ie, including the aminopenicillins and newer semisynthetic penicillins).

Serious immediate reactions in patients challenged with penicillin following negative penicillin skin testing have not been reported. In large scale studies, 1 to 3 percent of penicillin skin test-negative patients (ie, when tested with the major determinant plus penicillin G [or a full MDM panel]) developed mild, usually self-limiting reactions upon being challenged with the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/3,6,8,18,24,38,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,8,18,24,38,44-46</a>].</p><p>The clinical importance of including the MDM in skin testing is controversial, since the negative predictive value of skin testing with only PPL and benzylpenicillin is comparable with testing with all the reagents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/3,4,8,18,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,8,18,22-25</a>]. The best available estimate is that at least another 10 percent of penicillin-sensitized patients can be identified by using the full panel of MDM reagents (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a>, benzylpenicilloate, and benzylpenilloate). Skin testing with the minor determinant penicillin G alone is not the recommended approach. (See <a href=\"#H22605972\" class=\"local\">'Minor determinants'</a> above.)</p><p>Skin testing with the aminopenicillins is not as well-studied, and very few data are available on the predictive value. There is an impression from the Spanish experience that the negative predictive value is not as high as that of the benzylpenicillin determinants, but this has not been demonstrated conclusively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2468787\"><span class=\"h3\">Confirmatory challenge after negative skin testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient with negative skin test results, the absence of allergy should be confirmed by administering an age-appropriate dose of the penicillin to which the patient initially reacted, followed by one to two hours of observation to ensure that an immediate reaction does not occur. Challenge is indicated because the negative predictive value for penicillin skin testing with the combination of PPL and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> is very high, but not 100 percent. Also, confirming that the drug is tolerated will maximize the comfort of the patient and other clinicians with using penicillins in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>It is best to challenge the patient with the specific penicillin to which <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> reacted, when possible. The following examples are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient who reacted to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, challenging with amoxicillin ensures that the patient is not selectively allergic to amoxicillin. The negative predictive value of penicillin skin testing in patients primarily allergic to aminopenicillins is not well-defined. Challenge with amoxicillin will detect allergy to amoxicillin or penicillin, whereas challenge with penicillin would only identify penicillin allergy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient who reacted to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a>, challenge with the combination can help identify clavulanate allergy if both penicillin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> skin tests were negative but clavulanate was not available for testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For testing of inpatients with a current need for a particular penicillin product, the challenge procedure can be incorporated into the first parenteral dose by administering <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10<sup>th</sup></span> of a normal dose, observing for one hour, then if there is no adverse reaction, administering the remaining <span class=\"nowrap\">9/10<sup>th</sup></span> of the dose and observing for another hour. Patients who tolerate this type of challenge prove that they are not allergic and can receive additional doses normally.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346228419\"><span class=\"h1\">RESENSITIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on available data, resensitization appears to occur in 0 to 3 percent of patients after a course of an oral penicillin and up to 20 percent after a course of a parenteral penicillin. However, resensitization does not predict clinical reactivity. The clinical implications of this must be weighed in the context of the severity of the patient's initial reaction.</p><p>Several studies have examined rates of resensitization, or the redevelopment of penicillin-specific IgE, in patients who had lost their sensitivity. Resensitization may be determined by the number of patients who convert their penicillin skin tests from negative (before the challenge) to positive (after the challenge). However, this method does not predict which patients will actually react, because sensitization does not predict actual allergy precisely. Another way to assess the risk of recurrence is to determine the number of patients with a history of penicillin allergy who tolerate <strong>two or more</strong> courses of penicillins, who can therefore be assumed to not have been resensitized by the initial course.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Following oral administration</strong> &ndash; Using the methods just described, most studies of penicillin resensitization after oral challenge or after a single course of an oral penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> showed resensitization rates between 0 and 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/44,46,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46,48-50</a>], which are comparable with the rate of primary sensitization. Another study evaluated resensitization after repeated courses of oral penicillin in 53 adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Patients with a convincing history of penicillin allergy and initially negative penicillin skin tests were challenged with three consecutive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-v-potassium-oral-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin V</a> courses and underwent three repeat penicillin skin tests. None converted to a positive skin test during this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Based on these data, it is not routinely necessary to repeat skin testing in a patient with past penicillin reactions who has tolerated a subsequent course of oral penicillin. Similarly, if penicillin skin testing is not available and patients with a history of penicillin allergy are given and tolerate penicillin via graded challenge, no special precautions are required for future penicillin treatment courses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Following intravenous or intramuscular administration</strong> &ndash; Resensitization following parenteral administration of penicillin may be more common (rates of 0 to 20 percent have been reported), but these data are derived from fewer, smaller scale studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/penicillin-skin-testing/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. Therefore, repeat skin testing (or cautious administration of penicillins if skin testing is not available) may be necessary for patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have tolerated a parenteral course of penicillin or whose initial penicillin reaction was acute and severe.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3210217298\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Patients with detectable penicillin-specific IgE on their mast cells are said to be &quot;sensitized&quot; to penicillin and are at high risk for an immediate allergic reaction to the drug. Skin testing is the most rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective testing modality for identifying penicillin-sensitized patients. (See <a href=\"#H2501922727\" class=\"local\">'Immediate penicillin reactions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H887308111\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of skin testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penicillin skin testing is a safe procedure, although it should be performed by allergy experts when possible, since they have the training to interpret the results accurately and the experience, staff, and equipment to treat possible (albeit rare) allergic reactions.
