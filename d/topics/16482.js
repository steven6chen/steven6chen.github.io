Substance use disorders (SUDs) in physicians have thus been subject to considerable clinical and regulatory attention. Physicians with SUDs have long been described in the United States and other countries as &quot;impaired physicians,&quot; a term that is also applied to physicians with psychiatric, cognitive, behavioral, or general medical problems with potential to adversely affect the physician&rsquo;s ability to perform specific duties. Terminology has evolved to &ldquo;physicians with potentially impairing conditions,&rdquo; in order to reflect the reality that not all physicians with a diagnosable SUD demonstrate workplace impairment. </p><p>Most of the published data on this subject are limited to physicians in the United States, where treatment of physicians with SUDs is typically overseen by a physician health program (PHP).

As an example, in an anonymous survey of 280 attending physicians and 256 advanced practice clinicians at a major children&rsquo;s hospital, more than 80 percent came to work even when physically ill in the last year due to a sense of obligation to patients and colleagues, as well as fear of ostracism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-identification-and-engagement/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confidence in understanding medications may contribute to self-medication and underestimating consequences of unsupervised or nonmedical use of prescription drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-identification-and-engagement/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability to perform under stress and despite personal difficulties is a hallmark of the profession.

The earliest symptom of a substance use disorder is often discord in a primary relationship. Isolation and avoidance of peers and friends is common. The addicted physician suffers emotionally and may exhibit signs of depression, irritability, mood swings and disillusionment.</p><p>With progression of addiction, there is an increasing impact on social life, health and finances. Excessive spending is common.

Spiritual problems may exist, although these are seldom identified until the physician undergoes a formal evaluation by an addiction specialist.

In one meta-analysis, rates of suicide were 70 percent higher in age-matched males and 250 to 400 percent higher in age-matched females compared with the general population.

Clinical performance may be the last thing to be impacted; evidence of work-related impairment suggests a severe SUD. As an example, in a 2017 report of 124 physicians referred to the Colorado PHP due to concerns of cognitive <span class=\"nowrap\">impairment/decline,</span> 9 percent were diagnosed with a substance use disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-identification-and-engagement/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Denial is often prominent in individuals with SUDs. Physicians are adept at being able to &quot;suit up&quot; (ie, look well and function as if well).

Alcohol use disorders may exist for more than 15 years before progression of the illness leads to a point where the user or associates recognize need for treatment. Drugs such as intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> may cause observable consequences within a few months to one year.</p><p>Physicians who develop SUDs often begin to use alcohol excessively <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> use illicit drugs prior to medical school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-identification-and-engagement/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>].

PHPs are available to provide advice about reporting upon request. In some states the threshold for reporting has been lowered to include substance abusing physicians who have not yet manifested impaired work performance. The reporting requirements of these &ldquo;low threshold&rdquo; states are meant to prevent physician impairment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1714180678\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening for drug use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine random drug testing of physicians may be an effective component of both prevention and early intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-identification-and-engagement/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Routine drug testing of physicians is a controversial issue resisted by many organizations representing physicians.

The emotional and physical health of family members is compromised. Family members are often left to themselves dealing with day-to-day stressors, financial issues, and shame. Children of parents with an SUD often have significant psychosocial issues, including a predilection for drug use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-identification-and-engagement/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1714180573\"><span class=\"h2\">Intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some physicians with active SUDs will enter treatment on their own initiative; others will do so after receiving feedback from a family member or colleague, while others will resist acknowledging that they have a problem and may benefit from an intervention.

The aim is to help the physician accept assessment and treatment with sensitivity to <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> profession, employment, licensure, and desire for anonymity.</p><p>Participants in an intervention describe to the physician specific, observable problem behaviors and incidents that have led to their concern about impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-identification-and-engagement/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. A script can be helpful. Participants should be kind and empathic, express positive regard for the physician&rsquo;s abilities, and avoid accusations, blame, arguing, or negotiating. An intervention should have a specific plan of action, typically including a setting for professional assessment and treatment, and transportation providing for a safe transition. Participants in the intervention should insist that the action be immediate.</p><p>Participants may include the physician&rsquo;s colleagues, friends, staff, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family. The leader should be an experienced professional who is familiar with the intricacies of the physician&rsquo;s role. The leader should not be the physician&rsquo;s friend, close colleague, or employer &ndash; relationships that can comprise the person&rsquo;s objectivity. He or she should identify the other participants and educate them. They should all share the belief that the intervention is needed and agree on a plan. One participant who is opposed or ambivalent at an intervention can sabotage the process.</p><p>The style, setting, and urgency of an intervention should be customized to the physician based on such factors as the level of suspected impairment, the severity of the SUD, concern for imminent danger to the physician or <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> patients, and input from a PHP. Mornings may be the best time to schedule the intervention, when there is the least likelihood of physician intoxication.</p><p>Many physicians with active SUDs who are subject to an intervention will go along with the plan for a professional assessment and treatment. Because physicians work in a safety-sensitive occupation, a more coercive approach may be needed with a physician who refuses. The consequences of not following through with the plan should be made clear to the physician. An example of such consequences is the impaired physician&rsquo;s loss of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> medical license and clinical position. Involvement with a PHP may be helpful in posing these potential consequences.</p><p>Concerns have been raised regarding the ethics of this &ldquo;beneficent coercion&rdquo; by PHPs who require physicians to be evaluated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treated for SUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/substance-use-disorders-in-physicians-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-identification-and-engagement/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].
