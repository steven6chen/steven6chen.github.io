First described in children by George Still in 1896, &quot;Still's disease&quot; has become the eponymous term for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 1971, the term &quot;adult Still's disease&quot; was used to describe a series of adult patients who had features similar to the children with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and did not fulfill criteria for classic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ASD will be reviewed here. The treatment and prognosis of ASD are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adult-stills-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adult Still's disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of adult Still's disease (ASD) is unknown; both genetic factors and a variety of infectious triggers have been suggested as important, but there has been no proof of an infectious etiology, and the evidence supporting a role for genetic factors has been mixed. It is uncertain whether all patients with ASD share the same etiopathogenic factors.</p><p>Proposed pathogens have included numerous viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]; suspected bacterial pathogens include <em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em> and <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>].</p><p>As an example of studies of the immunogenetics of ASD, in a series of 62 French patients, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B17, -B18, -B35, and -DR2 were associated with ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, other studies have not confirmed these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Familial cases are uncommon, and there have been few reports of cases in twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adult Still's disease is very uncommon. A retrospective French study estimated the annual incidence of adult Still's disease (ASD) to be 0.16 cases per 100,000 people, with an equal distribution between the sexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There is a bimodal age distribution, with one peak between the ages of 15 and 25 and the second between the ages of 36 and 46. However, patients older than age 70 have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47017780\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY/DISEASE COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical course of adult Still's disease (ASD) can be divided into three main patterns: monophasic (or monocyclic), intermittent, and chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Approximately one-third of patients fall into each category; however, in some studies the chronic articular pattern is more common. It is not uncommon for the first two patterns (monophasic and intermittent) to evolve into the chronic articular pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monophasic pattern &ndash; Patients with monophasic ASD have a disease course that typically lasts only weeks to months, completely resolving within less than a year in most patients. Systemic features, including fever, rash, serositis, and hepatosplenomegaly, predominate in this group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittent pattern &ndash; Patients with intermittent ASD have one or more disease flares, with or without articular symptoms, with complete remissions between episodes lasting from weeks up to one or two years. Although subsequent flares cannot be predicted, they tend to be less severe and of shorter duration than the initial disease episode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic pattern &ndash; Patients with chronic ASD have persistently active disease, in which articular symptoms usually predominate. A destructive arthritis may occur in patients in this group.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major clinical features of adult Still's disease (ASD) include fever, rash, and arthritis or arthralgia; each occur in about 75 to 95 percent of patients (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Fever'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Rash'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A majority of patients experienced each of a number of other symptoms or findings, including myalgia, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Musculoskeletal'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pharyngitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly'</a> below.)</p><p>Other features that occur in a minority of patients include hepatomegaly, pleurisy, pericarditis, and abdominal pain (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Liver disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H54936103\" class=\"local\">'Cardiopulmonary disease'</a> below). An infrequent but serious, potentially fatal complication is the macrophage activation syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fever of ASD is usually quotidian (a daily recurring fever) or double-quotidian (two fever spikes per day). Fever often precedes other manifestations. The temperature swings can be dramatic, with changes of 4&ordm;C (7.2&ordm;F) occurring within four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/1,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20</a>]. Complete defervescence is not always a characteristic of the quotidian fevers in patients with ASD, as fever persists between spikes in approximately 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. ASD can also present as fever of unknown origin (FUO) and may be a common cause of FUO in some regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A temperature of greater than 39.5&ordm;C is associated more strongly with the monophasic pattern of ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiologies-of-fever-of-unknown-origin-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiologies of fever of unknown origin in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H47017780\" class=\"local\">'Natural history/disease course'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Rash</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic skin rash of ASD is an evanescent, salmon-colored, macular or maculopapular cutaneous eruption that is usually nonpruritic and tends to occur with the fever and disappear during afebrile periods. The rash predominantly involves the trunk and extremities but can also involve the palms, the soles, and, occasionally, the face. The Koebner phenomenon may be present, in which the cutaneous eruption can sometimes be elicited by stroking the skin; the rash may sometimes be found on physical examination in areas where there is pressure on the skin from tight clothing, such as at the beltline or beneath the breasts.</p><p>The cutaneous histopathology in ASD reveals nonspecific findings, including dermal edema and mild perivascular inflammation in the superficial dermis, consisting primarily of lymphocytes and histiocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56878%7ERHEUM%2F72353\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56878 graphicRef72353 \">picture 1A-B</a>). Immunofluorescence of the skin biopsy may show slight deposition of complement component 3 (C3) in the blood vessel walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthralgias or arthritis are universal features of ASD, and myalgias are common:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arthralgia and arthritis</strong> &ndash; Initially, the arthritis may be mild, transient, and oligoarticular. These manifestations evolve over a period of months in some patients into a more severe and potentially destructive polyarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The most commonly involved joints, in descending order, are the knees, wrists, ankles, elbows, proximal interphalangeal joints, and shoulders. Fusion of the wrist joints is a characteristic of ASD, although it occurs in only a minority of patients. Synovial fluid and tissue findings are consistent with the inflammatory arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H2969228116\" class=\"local\">'Synovial fluid and tissue'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one study from Japan, which included 71 patients who satisfied criteria for ASD, but not rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other rheumatic diseases, 16 of 71 patients (23 percent) subsequently met the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for RA after a median follow-up of 18 months (range 6 to 132 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Few of the patients had positive tests for rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies, and unlike RA 6 out of 16 (38 percent) had inflammatory arthritis affecting the distal interphalangeal joints. These patients also had lower levels of ferritin or interleukin (IL)-18 than the other patients with ASD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myalgia </strong>&ndash; Myalgia is common, often worse with fever spikes, and can sometimes be severe and debilitating. Muscle weakness is not present, but the serum creatinine kinase and aldolase concentrations can be slightly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Electromyographic studies and muscle biopsy are usually normal or show a nonspecific inflammatory myopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharyngitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A severe, nonsuppurative pharyngitis is common in ASD. In a literature review of 341 cases, sore throat was noted in 69 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Pharyngitis can occasionally precede the development of fever or rash and can also occur with disease relapses. A study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck suggested that cricothyroid perichondritis or aseptic nonexudative pharyngitis could be the etiology of the sore throat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatomegaly is reported in a significant minority of patients; the frequency in different studies ranges from 12 to 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Modest elevations of serum hepatic aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase are even more common (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Liver function studies'</a> below). These changes are generally related to the disease, rather than drugs used to treat ASD, as they usually antedate the use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and improve as the disease responds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>At least eight cases of fulminant liver failure in association with ASD have been described, with four fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/9,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,27</a>]. All patients had been treated with NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54936103\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiopulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericarditis, pleural effusions, and transient pulmonary infiltrates have been observed in 30 to 40 percent of patients with ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/18,19,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,28</a>]. Affected patients may complain of a slight cough, pleuritic chest pain, or mild dyspnea. However, severe interstitial lung disease has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Uncommonly, some patients progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,31</a>]. Another rare complication is myocarditis, which can cause arrhythmias, heart failure, and cardiac tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Pleuritis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are more common in ASD when it is associated with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Slightly tender, enlarged cervical lymph nodes are seen in about one-half of patients with ASD. Lymphadenopathy is present in up to two thirds of patients, and splenomegaly may also occur in one-third to one-half of patients with ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Typically, the lymphadenopathy is symmetrical. Because of the frequent presence of fever and leukocytosis, there may be diagnostic confusion with lymphoma in patients with ASD who also have lymphadenopathy. (See <a href=\"#H99098325\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Lymph node biopsy in ASD typically shows intense, paracortical immunoblastic hyperplasia, which is distinct from the changes observed with RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, or Kikuchi's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Changes on light microscopy may resemble lymphoma, but immunohistochemistry reveals a benign polyclonal B-cell hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Macrophage activation syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ASD can be associated with the MAS, which is also referred to as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or reactive hemophagocytic syndrome (RHS), but is usually termed MAS (or RHS) when it occurs either in ASD or in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This complication of ASD has been thought to occur in a small minority of patients but may be underdiagnosed, as suggested by retrospective studies in which MAS occurred in 6 (12 percent) of 50 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and 21 (19 percent) of 109 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] who fulfilled the Yamaguchi classification criteria for ASD. Other studies have reported MAS in 15 percent of 52 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and in 14 percent of 57 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]; MAS was the presenting symptom in seven of the eight patients in the former study and six of the eight patients in the latter study. MAS can occur at any time during ASD, and simultaneous presentations of ASD and MAS are not unusual. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H23116141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Rheumatologic disorders/MAS'</a>.)</p><p>Flares of ASD and the development of MAS can be similar clinically. Anemia and marked elevation of serum ferritin and C-reactive protein (CRP) may occur in either condition. Unlike ASD, patients with MAS may have leukopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia, and very high levels of serum triglyceride. Additionally, despite elevations in ferritin and CRP, the levels of haptoglobin and fibrinogen may be normal or low in the patients with ASD who develop MAS, and some of these patients have normal or unexpectedly low erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/36,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38,39</a>]. One study suggests that MAS is particularly likely in patients with at least two of the following: thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hepatomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The diagnostic hallmark of MAS is the presence on bone marrow examination of numerous, well-differentiated macrophages (histiocytes) that are engaged actively in the phagocytosis of hematopoietic elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/36,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,40</a>]. Pancytopenia is more common in ASD when it is associated with MAS.</p><p>MAS and HLH unassociated with ASD should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of ASD.

Other features may include bone pain and skeletal hyperostosis. It is associated with hematologic malignancy in about a third of patients. A neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis or less often, an urticarial vasculitis, may be present, which together with the other clinical and laboratory findings help to distinguish the disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urticarial-vasculitis#H42\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urticarial vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sweet syndrome</strong> &ndash; ASD and Sweet syndrome may occasionally be confused. Sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is an uncommon inflammatory disorder characterized by the abrupt appearance of painful, edematous, and erythematous papules, plaques, or nodules on the skin. Fever and leukocytosis, as in patients with ASD, frequently accompany the cutaneous lesions, and involvement of the eyes, musculoskeletal system, and internal organs may occur. A careful history and skin examination, along with skin biopsy can readily distinguish these disorders.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sarcoid-arthropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sarcoid arthropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sarcoid: Muscle, bone, and vascular disease manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Kikuchi disease</strong> &ndash; Kikuchi disease, also called Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease or Kikuchi histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, is a rare, benign condition of unknown cause usually characterized by cervical lymphadenopathy and fever. Histopathology of the involved lymph nodes differentiates Kikuchi disease from ASD and other conditions that it may mimic. Patients may also have fatigue, arthralgia or arthritis, rash, hepatosplenomegaly, night sweats, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kikuchi-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kikuchi disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis</strong> &ndash; The distinction between secondary (non-hereditary) hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and ASD is difficult; macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is the name usually used to denote HLH that arises in patients with ASD (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a> above). Another term for this form of HLH is reactive hemophagocytic syndrome. Patients with HLH unrelated to ASD and with patients with MAS may have similar degrees of hyperferritinemia to ASD, but a distinction can sometimes be made clinically based upon cytopenia in multiple lineages, as leukopenia, including granulocytopenia and lymphopenia, as well as thrombocytopenia are characteristic of <span class=\"nowrap\">HLH/MAS</span> but not of ASD. Some differences in the pattern of acute phase reactants may also be seen. The diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">HLH/MAS</span> can be confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. Both marked hyperferritinemia and a low fraction of glycosylated serum ferritin also occur in MAS as well as in various syndromes associated with hemophagocytosis, such as those due to lymphoma and to severe drug reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/36,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,63,64</a>].

These are useful for research but lack the sensitivity and specificity needed for clinical diagnosis. The approach to the diagnosis of ASD is described separately, as is the role of specific clinical and laboratory features used to support the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H60576116\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H99098298\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>All of these sets are similar, differing generally in the number of major and minor criteria required for diagnosis, with some variation among the individual criteria. A comparison of these seven sets of criteria demonstrated that the Japanese criteria, often termed the Yamaguchi criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], have the highest sensitivity in patients with a definite diagnosis of ASD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yamaguchi criteria &ndash; The Yamaguchi criteria require the presence of five features, with at least two being major diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-adult-stills-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In addition, the presence of any infection, malignancy, or other rheumatic disorder known to mimic ASD in its clinical features precludes the diagnosis of ASD, at least for the purpose of research.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The four major Yamaguchi criteria are:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever of at least 39&ordm;C (102.2&ordm;F) lasting at least one week</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arthralgias or arthritis lasting two weeks or longer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A nonpruritic macular or maculopapular skin rash that is salmon-colored in appearance and usually found over the trunk or extremities during febrile episodes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Leukocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">(10,000/microL</span> or greater), with at least 80 percent granulocytes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The minor Yamaguchi criteria include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lymphadenopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hepatomegaly or splenomegaly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormal liver function studies, particularly elevations in aspartate and alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Negative tests for antinuclear antibody (ANA) and rheumatoid factor (RF)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult Still's disease (ASD) is an inflammatory disorder characterized by quotidian fevers, arthritis, and an evanescent salmon-colored rash typically found on the trunk. Pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and a number of nonspecific hematologic findings, including leukocytosis, may be present. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course of ASD can be divided into three main patterns: monophasic, intermittent, and chronic. Systemic manifestations predominate in the two former patterns, while articular involvement predominates in patients with chronic disease. (See <a href=\"#H47017780\" class=\"local\">'Natural history/disease course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) occurs in a minority of patients with ASD. MAS is the term used for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) occurring in the context of ASD or Still's disease in children. Bone marrow aspiration is the most sensitive means of diagnosing reactive hemophagocytic syndrome (RHS). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"#H54936495\" class=\"local\">'Hematologic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ASD has been associated with markedly elevated serum ferritin concentrations in as much as 70 percent of patients. Serum ferritin values above 3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in a patient with compatible symptoms should lead to suspicion of ASD in the absence of a bacterial or viral infection. (See <a href=\"#H54937000\" class=\"local\">'Serum ferritin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ASD is usually seronegative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) or rheumatoid factor (RF). However, a low titer ANA or RF can occur and do not exclude the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Immunologic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ASD is a diagnosis of exclusion. The diagnosis is based upon the presence of characteristic clinical and laboratory findings, such as daily spiking fever, the characteristic evanescent rash, arthralgia or arthritis, and leukocytosis; and the exclusion of infectious, malignant, autoimmune and other conditions that may be confused with ASD. A markedly elevated serum ferritin may also be present. There is no specific test or combination of tests that can be used to establish the diagnosis of ASD. (See <a href=\"#H99098298\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H99098325\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of classification criteria have been proposed for use in research; the Yamaguchi criteria are most widely used.
