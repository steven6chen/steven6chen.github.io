Multiple different human protein precursors of amyloid fibrils are known.

More detailed discussions of the individual disorders are also presented separately. (See appropriate topic reviews as indicated in the relevant sections below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87655925\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It was Rudolph Virchow in 1854 who adopted the term &quot;amyloid,&quot; first introduced by Schleiden in 1838 to describe plant starch, to refer to tissue deposits of material that stained in a similar manner to cellulose when exposed to iodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In these original descriptions, amyloid deposits were noted by Rokitansky to have a &quot;waxy&quot; or &quot;lardaceous&quot; appearance grossly and by Virchow to be amorphous and hyaline on light microscopy. Congo red is a direct cotton dye and pH indicator that was developed by Paul Bottinger in 1883; it was later shown to confer typical apple<strong>-</strong>green birefringence with polarized microscopy, introduced in the 1920s by Bennhold for the better demonstration of amyloid. The use of thioflavine T, producing an intense yellow-green fluorescence, was popularized in the 1950s (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63840%7ENEPH%2F78183%7ENEPH%2F54148%7ENEPH%2F75254\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63840 graphicRef78183 graphicRef54148 graphicRef75254 \">picture 1A-D</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Virchow recorded the prescient observation in his Cellular Pathology (1858) that &quot;I am as yet much more inclined to admit, that the blood in this disease undergoes a chemical alteration in its fluid constituents, than that it contains the pathological substances in a material form.&quot;</p><p>Electron microscopic examination of amyloid deposits, first performed in 1959, generally demonstrates straight and unbranching fibrils 8 to 10 nm in width, which may be composed of protofilaments at higher resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Transmission electron and atomic force microscopy have had a role in elucidating the three dimensional structure of these macromolecular aggregates and in defining folding intermediates, including small oligomers and amorphous aggregates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In many instances, the type of amyloid fibril unit can be further defined by immunohistology (immunofluorescence or immunoenzymatic techniques) or by immunoelectron microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amyloidosis results from the extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils composed of low molecular weight subunits of a variety of proteins, typically in the range of 5 to 25 kD; many of these proteins circulate as constituents of plasma. Genetic factors play an important role in many forms of amyloidosis. Point mutations, deletions, and premature stop codons may result in structural changes predisposing to fibril formation (fibrillogenesis) by these proteins and the development of amyloid. Depending upon the type of amyloidosis, factors affecting protein folding, including chaperones and failure of disaggregating pathways, may be operative. Effects of associated non-fibrillar cofactors and disorders leading to increased production of precursor amyloidogenic proteins, including chronic inflammation and some plasma cell dyscrasias, are important, particularly with regard to systemic amyloidoses. (See <a href=\"#H50255496\" class=\"local\">'Fibril formation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H50255503\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50255496\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibril formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amyloid fibrils are insoluble polymers comprised of low molecular weight subunit proteins. These subunits are derived in turn from soluble precursors which undergo conformational changes that lead to the adoption of a predominantly antiparallel beta-pleated sheet configuration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Oligomeric intermediates that are non-fibrillar may be responsible for tissue toxicity and disease pathogenesis in certain amyloid related disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Routes to fibrillogenesis include partial folding or unfolding of the precursor protein that may be facilitated by acidification or proteolysis and accelerated by nucleation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Fibril formation is also associated with co-deposition of other non-fibrillar substances, notably including glycosaminoglycans (GAGs, particularly heparan sulfate), serum amyloid P-component (SAP, a member of the pentraxin family that includes C-reactive protein), and specific apolipoproteins (E and J) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Cofactors may significantly modulate fibrillogenesis at any of several steps involved in the conversion of soluble precursors to fibrils and potentially may influence the deposition phase of amyloid in tissue, as well as resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Circulating forms of the relevant subunit protein do not appear to be the precursors of the fibril in several forms of localized or organ-specific amyloidosis, in contrast with the systemic amyloids in which such circulating forms are presumed to be the precursors (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Organ-specific amyloid'</a> below). In some instances (eg, localized AL amyloidosis involving the conjunctiva, lung, skin, or genitourinary tract), organ-specific amyloidosis has been shown to be identical to systemic forms of amyloid biochemically. It is presumed that the precursor protein (immunoglobulin light chain) is synthesized and processed at sites contiguous to amyloid deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. This model for amyloid formation at the sites of protein synthesis has been corroborated in some in vitro models of AA amyloid, in which deposition occurs around cell types such as monocytes, macrophages, or mesangial cells in tissue culture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50255503\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least 30 different human and 10 different animal protein precursors of amyloid fibrils are now known, and the corresponding amyloid diseases associated with each of the affected molecules and nomenclature for the subunit proteins have been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F97157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97157 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Several types of amyloidosis are clearly hereditary, and clinical disease has been linked in most familial forms to missense mutations of the precursor proteins. Heritable factors in amyloidosis include the following, which are discussed in greater detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-factors-in-the-amyloid-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic factors in the amyloid diseases&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutant genes encoding abnormal proteins that are more prone to fibrillogenesis than their wild-type counterparts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymorphisms of cofactors (eg apolipoprotein E) or of subunit proteins (eg, serum amyloid A)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heritable disorders that affect the level or accumulation of precursor proteins (eg, presenilin mutations in familial Alzheimer disease)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heritable disorders that may result in chronic inflammation and deposition of precursor protein in susceptible populations (eg, pyrin and cryopyrin mutations in Familial Mediterranean Fever [FMF] and Muckle Wells syndrome, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] receptor mutations in the TNF receptor associated periodic syndrome [TRAPS], respectively.</p><p/><p>In some instances, deletions or premature stop codon mutations have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/7,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20</a>]. Virtually all of the heredofamilial amyloidoses associated with nephropathic, neuropathic, or cardiopathic disease are dominantly inherited heterozygous disorders, and both the wild-type and mutant molecules can be identified in the amyloid deposits. In some instances (eg, transthyretin [TTR], apolipoprotein A-I [ApoAI], Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein [APP], and prion protein [PRP]), both the wild-type and mutant molecules may separately form amyloid fibrils under different circumstances (eg, wild type TTR; ApoA1; and the beta protein, Ab, a cleavage product of APP; may form deposits in association with organ-specific aging pathology in the heart, aorta, and brain, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Hematologic abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p>The prevalence of the most common types of amyloidosis varies in different parts of the world. In developed countries, AL is the most common type of systemic amyloidosis, while, in developing countries, AA amyloid is more frequent. This is a likely result of a higher burden of chronic infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, and osteomyelitis in the latter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In the two most common forms of systemic amyloidosis, primary (AL) and secondary (AA) amyloidosis, the major sites of clinically important amyloid deposition are in the kidneys, heart, and liver. In some disorders, clinically important amyloid deposition is limited to one organ. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Types of amyloidosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Organ-specific amyloid'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Renal disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Cardiomyopathy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal involvement most often presents as asymptomatic proteinuria or clinically apparent nephrotic syndrome. However, primary deposition can be limited to the blood vessels or tubules; such patients present with renal failure with little or no proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. End-stage renal disease is the cause of death in a minority of patients. Amyloid nephropathy is common in AA and AL amyloidosis, but is rare in ATTR; Lect-2, fibrinogen A-alpha, and apolipoproteins A1, A2, and A4 are rarer causes of nephropathic amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, familial or sporadic disease due to mutations in the fibrinogen alpha chain were the most common form of hereditary nephropathic amyloid in a large survey from the UK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Cardiac amyloidosis is common in ATTR and AL amyloidosis, and can also complicate AA; it is rare in A-beta2m (dialysis) amyloidosis. Familial forms of amyloid in which cardiac disease may be significant include those due to fibrinogen-alpha and apolipoprotein A. Lastly, isolated atrial amyloidosis due to atrial natriuretic peptide is a common and often asymptomatic concomitant of aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Two major mechanisms have been described: factor X deficiency due to binding on amyloid fibrils primarily in the liver and spleen, and decreased synthesis of coagulation factors in patients with advanced liver disease. However, some patients with abnormal bleeding have no abnormalities in any coagulation test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In such patients, amyloid infiltration of blood vessels may contribute to the bleeding diathesis.

Tracheobronchial infiltration can cause hoarseness, stridor, airway obstruction, and dysphagia; bronchoscopic or surgical resection of airway abnormalities may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/68-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-73</a>]. Pulmonary involvement by amyloid is particularly important for AL amyloidosis, which may be systemic or occur in localized forms associated with Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome and tracheobronchial amyloid; ATTR due to wild type or mutant protein in aging patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) or systemic senile amyloidosis (SSA) may also result in alveolar deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

In some patients the presence of amyloid is suggested by findings on imaging. (See <a href=\"#H156200606\" class=\"local\">'Imaging and SAP scanning'</a> below.)</p><p>Tissue biopsy is important because assumptions regarding the type of amyloid may be incorrect. As an example, AA amyloidosis is only one cause of the nephrotic syndrome in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; other causes include drug side effects, immune-complex disease, or an unrelated disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Drugs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-minimal-change-disease-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of minimal change disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Drugs'</a>.)</p><p>AL amyloidosis should be suspected in all patients with amyloid deposits demonstrated on biopsy who do not have a chronic infectious or inflammatory disease, end-stage renal disease, or a family history of amyloidosis. Such patients should undergo further evaluation to determine if paraproteins and a plasma cell dyscrasia are present. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Paraproteins'</a> below.)</p><p>A thorough family history and exclusion of these heritable disorders are warranted if a plasma cell dyscrasia or a cause of secondary (AA) amyloid cannot be documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/40,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biopsies can be obtained from either clinically uninvolved sites, such as subcutaneous fat, minor salivary glands, or rectal mucosa; or from dysfunctional organs (eg, kidney, nerve). We suggest a fat pad aspiration or biopsy as the initial sampling technique for patients with other than single organ involvement, because this procedure is less likely than liver, renal, or even rectal biopsy to be complicated by serious bleeding, although biopsy of other tissues may have greater sensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H23769855\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal fat pad biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>Aspiration or biopsy of subcutaneous fat with Congo red staining and examination using polarizing microscopy has an overall sensitivity of 57 to 85 percent and a specificity of 92 to 100 percent for primary (AL) or secondary (AA) amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/81-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-84</a>]. The diagnostic sensitivity is higher in those with multiorgan involvement who are suspected of having systemic amyloidosis due to immunoglobulin light chain (primary, or AL), AA protein (secondary), or transthyretin (senile cardiac or familial amyloid polyneuropathy) deposition. Fat pad aspiration or biopsy has a low sensitivity for amyloidosis in patients with a single involved organ. (See <a href=\"#H23769855\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal fat pad biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>Biopsy of a specifically involved site, rather than an abdominal fat pad biopsy, is suggested for patients with a limited number of affected organs, because patients with single organ involvement are less likely to have biopsies of unaffected tissues reveal amyloid. This was illustrated by a study of 450 patients with peripheral neuropathy who had fat pad aspiration biopsies performed; among the 143 who had only peripheral neuropathy, none had amyloid deposits noted in the aspiration biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In contrast, among the 307 patients with at least one other clinical feature of amyloidosis, the rate of positive aspirations was 6 percent.</p><p>The sensitivity of rectal biopsy in one large series composed predominantly of patients with systemic amyloid (&quot;primary amyloid&quot; and myeloma associated in 193 patients, &quot;secondary&quot; or localized to a single organ in 41 patients) was 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. The sensitivity of kidney, liver, and carpal-tunnel biopsies were all 90 percent or more in this cohort. Although liver biopsy is rarely complicated by life-threatening bleeding, less invasive approaches to diagnosis than percutaneous liver biopsy are generally preferred.

This procedure is simple and can be performed in the office over 20 to 30 minutes, but the critical steps for analysis are proper preparation of glass slides for microscopic analysis by congo red birefringence and for immunohistology, which should be carried out by a pathology laboratory that is experienced with appropriate antibodies and which regularly carries out controls to validate testing. The aim of repeated aspiration, which may be done on both sides of the umbilicus as necessary, is to obtain adequate fat (approximately 30 mg) for routine studies, which may be increased to incorporate quantitation of subunit proteins by methods such as enzyme-linked immunoassay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteomic studies (mass spectroscopy, two dimensional gel electrophoresis, protein sequence analysis).

This is most useful for AA and transthyretin (TTR) amyloid and is less so for AL amyloid; variable staining of AL deposits with standard antisera to kappa or lambda constant region-determinants is due to loss of antigenic epitopes in the course of proteolytic processing of the constant region that precedes fibrillogenesis.

These direct methods of protein analysis are applicable to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens. However, these analyses are available only at specialized centers. The validation of this methodology for commercial purposes has been of particular interest. This method is performed using laser capture microdissection of amyloid from formalin-fixed amyloidotic tissue, followed by trypsin digestion, mass spectroscopy, and direct sequence analysis of peptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. This approach, which was originally used for the analysis of the proteomics of AL amyloid, has also been validated for AA; specific tissues, including nerve in patients with amyloid neuropathy and renal biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]; and for abdominal fat pad aspirates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-amyloidosis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

Ten percent of these patients had a mutant gene for an &quot;amyloidogenic&quot; protein, most often involving the alpha-chain of fibrinogen A or transthyretin.

These subunit proteins are derived, in turn, from soluble precursors which undergo conformational changes that lead to the adoption of a predominantly antiparallel beta-pleated sheet configuration. At least 30 different human protein precursors of amyloid fibrils are known (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F97157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97157 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two major forms of amyloidosis are the AL (primary) and AA (secondary) types. AL amyloid, the most common form in developed countries, is due to deposition of protein derived from immunoglobulin light chain fragments. It is a plasma cell dyscrasia in which a monoclonal immunoglobulin is detectable in the serum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> monoclonal light chains in the urine in approximately 80 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'AL amyloidosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">AA amyloidosis, the most common form in developing countries, may complicate chronic diseases in which there is ongoing or recurring inflammation, such as chronic infections; rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthropathy, or inflammatory bowel disease; or periodic fever syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'AA amyloidosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other major forms seen clinically include dialysis-related amyloidosis, heritable amyloidoses, age-related systemic amyloidosis and organ-specific amyloid. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis-related amyloidosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Heritable amyloidoses'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Age-related (senile) systemic amyloidosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Organ-specific amyloid'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations vary depending upon the type of amyloid and the distribution of deposition. Some clinical and laboratory features that suggest amyloidosis include waxy skin and easy bruising, enlarged muscles (eg, tongue, deltoids), symptoms and signs of heart failure, cardiac conduction abnormalities, hepatomegaly, evidence of heavy proteinuria or the nephrotic syndrome, peripheral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autonomic neuropathy, and impaired coagulation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Types of amyloidosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue biopsy should be used to confirm the diagnosis in all cases of amyloidosis, although the diagnosis of amyloidosis may be suspected on the basis of history and clinical manifestations. Fat pad aspiration biopsy is less likely than liver, renal, or even rectal biopsy to be complicated by serious bleeding; we thus suggest it as the initial biopsy technique for patients with other than single organ involvement. In patients with single organ involvement, biopsy of the clinically involved site is suggested because fat pad aspiration biopsy has a low sensitivity for amyloidosis in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have biopsy-documented amyloidosis and meet criteria for a well-defined plasma cell dyscrasia, such as multiple myeloma or Waldenstr&ouml;m&rsquo;s macroglobulinemia, need not undergo further diagnostic testing. Patients who are not known to have a plasma cell disorder should be further tested to determine whether a monoclonal protein is present in serum, urine, or both. A combination of serum and urine protein electrophoresis, followed by immunofixation, is recommended. Quantitation of serum free light chains is suggested for AL patients who do not have monoclonal proteins by immunofixation, and as a baseline for therapy. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Paraproteins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a monoclonal protein alone is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of AL amyloid in a patient with documented amyloidosis unless immunofluorescence has demonstrated monoclonal light chains in the amyloid deposits. Heritable types of amyloidosis should be excluded if a plasma cell dyscrasia (multiple myeloma or Waldenstr&ouml;m&rsquo;s macroglobulinemia) cannot be documented. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Paraproteins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of the different types of amyloidosis generally varies with the cause of fibril production.

Liver transplantation may be effective in certain of the hereditary amyloidoses. Therapies to promote the clearance of amyloid deposits of different types are also in development.
