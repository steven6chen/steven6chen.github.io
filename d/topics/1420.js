The certificate should state that the patient is currently stable, fit for air travel, and, if applicable, not contagious. Although a medical certificate is not needed for most patients, some travelers will be required to present one, for instance those requiring supplemental oxygen. The medical certificate required varies slightly among airlines and often requires that a summary of underlying medical conditions be carried by the passenger. Such a summary may be useful in case of an inflight medical decompensation.</p><p>Clinicians asked to certify that a patient is safe for airline travel should include consideration of the length of the anticipated flight, any problems in the past with tolerating air travel, and the conditions at the destination (eg, destination altitude, public health risks, and access to medical care). The clinician should assess any worsening of the patient's chronic medical conditions and any relevant medical history. Of particular concern are: cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disease, anemia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), epilepsy, stroke, recent surgery or procedure, recent trauma, diabetes, infectious disease, and mental illness.</p><p>Depending on their illnesses, patients should keep within reach (ie, not checked with their baggage) the following items [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detailed list of all medical conditions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All medications in the original labeled containers and a detailed list of all medications, including doses, and allergies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical alert bracelet for severe diseases <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> allergies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Copy of a recent electrocardiogram (ECG; for cardiac patients)</p><p/><p>Pre-travel immunizations and prophylaxis are discussed separately.

Particular attention should be given to patients with conditions that may worsen with the decreased partial pressure of oxygen during flight, primarily cardiac, pulmonary, and neurovascular conditions. A more detailed description of the cabin environment is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of inflight medical events on commercial airlines&quot;, section on 'Cabin environment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with well-compensated heart disease can travel without difficulty. Specific recommendations and important precautions for air travel in patients with heart disease are provided separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude, air travel, and heart disease&quot;</a>). A variety of practical tips for the cardiopulmonary patient traveling by air are found in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52930 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have recently suffered a stroke or other acute neurologic event should be given ample time to recover and demonstrate stability before confronting the stresses of flying. Guidelines from the Aerospace Medical Association (AsMA) advise that patients with stroke should be observed and stable for two to four weeks prior to any air travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, this is on the basis of expert opinion rather than explicit evidence. Stable post-stroke patients may travel when considered safe by their neurologist, although we suggest that a minimum two-week period of observation post-stroke, when feasible, is reasonable to assess stability. The guidelines also suggest that patients with frequent or crescendo transient ischemic attacks avoid air travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Patients with migraines have reported travel in airplanes or trains as triggers of their headaches. The cause is unclear and may relate to the stress of travel, sleep deprivation, high altitude, or other environmental stressors. Migraineurs, as with other patients, should be advised to maintain their prophylactic medicines and to carry rescue medication with them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Epilepsy is generally not a contraindication to flying; however, patients with frequent seizures (eg, one or more in the prior month) should not fly until their epilepsy is better controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with clinically significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other pulmonary or cardiopulmonary disease can be severely compromised due to cabin pressurization and the lower partial pressure of oxygen at higher elevations. This can cause hypoxia that may not be tolerated by those with limited pulmonary reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. At 8000 feet, there is 24 percent less oxygen available than at sea level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The clinician must determine the degree of respiratory compromise, the ability to tolerate the inflight environment, and whether arrangements should be made for supplemental oxygen. A detailed discussion of how to determine the need for supplemental oxygen is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traveling with oxygen aboard commercial air carriers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with severe, unstable asthma and those who have been hospitalized within six weeks should not fly until their symptoms resolve and they are symptom-free on a stable asthma medication regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Asthmatic patients who do fly should carry on their person a short-acting beta-2 selective adrenergic agonist metered dose inhaler and, for those with severe asthma, a course of oral steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute exacerbations of asthma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, or comparable diseases should be provided with appropriate antibiotic and secretion-clearing medications to be used before and during flight. They should stay well-hydrated and use oxygen in flight, if indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traveling with oxygen aboard commercial air carriers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Traditionally, a pneumothorax is an absolute contraindication to air travel, and how long to wait after resolution varies with the specific clinical situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Timing of travel in pneumothorax patients is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumothorax-and-air-travel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumothorax and air travel&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with sleep-disordered breathing diagnoses who use continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel PAP (BiPAP) who plan to sleep during a flight should be encouraged to bring their home machine onto the flight, and prior to flight should check with the airline about policies and power supply for the machine (battery versus using the airplane&rsquo;s supply) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Deep vein thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-distance travel, either by air or land, confers a small increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

This can lead to a number of problems including pain, vertigo, and tympanic membrane rupture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of inflight medical events on commercial airlines&quot;, section on 'Cabin environment'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with URIs who cannot avoid flying may benefit from an oral decongestant before the flight and a nasal spray containing a vasoconstrictor used 30 minutes before descent. On very long flights, the oral decongestant may have to be repeated. One randomized controlled trial found that oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pseudoephedrine</a> (120 mg taken at least 30 minutes before departure) reduced barotrauma in adults during flight; no trial has demonstrated the efficacy of nasal decongestants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Patients should avoid alcoholic beverages and drink plenty of fluids to ensure hydration and to keep secretions thin and easier to clear. Patients unable to clear their ears prior to flight should not fly due to the risk of developing barotitis or barosinusitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasal and sinus disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Commercial air travel is contraindicated for patients with severe sinusitis, large obstructing polyps, recent nasal or facial surgery, or severe recurrent epistaxis. Such conditions can obstruct sinus ostia, preventing pressure equilibration and predisposing to extension of disease into the orbits or central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For patients with allergic rhinitis, oral antihistamines and nasal steroids may be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43264876\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expansion of gas within the colon, with change in atmospheric pressure, can cause isolated abdominal pain. Some authors note that this can be exacerbated by fermenting or gas-producing food, eg, carbonated beverages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients with gastrointestinal disease should be made aware of this effect and may choose to avoid carbonated beverages while in flight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery and procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More patients now travel far from home for surgery and fly home soon after their procedure. Patients with significant comorbidities, pulmonary surgery, or postoperative anemia are at greater risk during flight and should be carefully assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. General anesthesia is not usually a concern, but postspinal headache has been reported seven days after a spinal anesthetic, possibly because changes in cabin pressure induced a dural leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Invasive procedures introduce air into isolated body cavities that could expand at altitude even in a pressurized cabin and cause barotrauma. Thus, patients should postpone air travel until at least 10 to 14 days after most surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/3,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21</a>]. This delay should provide enough time for air in the intrathoracic, intraabdominal, or other cavities to be resorbed and reduces the risk for barotrauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-inflight-medical-events-on-commercial-airlines#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of inflight medical events on commercial airlines&quot;, section on 'Cabin environment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumothorax-and-air-travel\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumothorax and air travel&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Laparoscopic abdominal procedures are less often associated with ileus than open procedures. The carbon dioxide introduced into the peritoneum during the procedure rapidly diffuses into the tissues, and patients can usually fly the next day if they do not have bloating. However, this has not been evaluated in a clinical trial.</p><p>Patients who have undergone a colonoscopy, with or without polypectomy, should wait at least 24 hours before flying because of the large amount of gas often present in the colon after a colonoscopy, and the possibility of a major complication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colonoscopy-in-adults#H133249458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colonoscopy in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with colostomies are not at increased risk inflight, but increased fecal output resulting from gaseous distention may occur.

Complete reabsorption could take up to six to eight weeks, depending on the type of gas used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Flying on a plane with an intraocular gas bubble in the eye will result in sudden expansion of the bubble, which can result in increased intraocular pressure and possible blindness.</p><p>Patients with glaucoma can safely travel if their disease is reasonably controlled and they have access to use their medications as directed, including during flight. Eye drops for glaucoma should be used according to the patient&rsquo;s normal schedule.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with full-leg casts may be required, for safety reasons, to travel by stretcher, purchase an extra seat, or fly business or first class. Casts applied within 48 hours should be split lengthwise along each side (ie, bivalved) to avoid injury from the expansion of air trapped between the skin and the cast if the limb swells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pneumatic splints should be partially deflated to avoid rupture from expanding gas or excessive compression of the affected limb.</p><p>Patients with a fractured jaw that is wired require travel with wire cutters and an escort familiar with what to do, unless the individual is fitted with self-quick-release wiring. Emergency release of wires may be needed in the event of a compromised airway. Due to security requirements, a patient needing to carry wire cutters should get clearance from the airline in advance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hemoglobin below 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> generally should be given supplemental oxygen, unless the anemia is known to be well-compensated. Anemic patients are at risk for lightheadedness and loss of consciousness during flight, even with minimal exertion, eg, walking to the lavatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The subject of air travel in people with sickle cell disease is discussed separately.

Wearing a medical alert bracelet is recommended. Preflight planning is important to ensure ready access to simple sugars and to the patient&rsquo;s diabetes medications, especially if they include insulin, and to adjust insulin and some other diabetes medication dosing schedules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3347577675\" class=\"local\">'Timing of medications'</a> above.)</p><p>As a general rule, when traveling east among time zones, the day is shortened and less insulin may be needed during the actual travel period; when traveling west among time zones, the day is lengthened and more insulin may be needed during the actual travel period.</p><p>Clinicians should emphasize the importance of carrying one&rsquo;s own supply of glucose-raising treatments (eg, snacks), since regular meal ingestion and access to food may be limited during travel. Patients who require insulin should carry insulin with all necessary equipment in carry-on baggage when flying. It is also important for patients to know that insulin will denature if exposed to extreme cold and should not be checked as baggage. According to the American Diabetes Association, unrefrigerated insulin remains usable for up to one month if kept at temperatures below 30&#730;C (86&#730;F).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Mental illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with psychiatric disorders that predispose to violent, disruptive, unsafe, or unpredictable behavior should not travel by air, nor should patients at risk for alcohol or drug withdrawal.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beyond the Basics topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supplemental-oxygen-on-commercial-airlines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Supplemental oxygen on commercial airlines (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients preparing for air travel should be counseled on adjusting the timing of their medicines. Patients should carry on their person (not checked with baggage) all their medications in their original labeled containers and any monitoring equipment necessary for their medications. They should also carry a list of medications, medical conditions and allergies, and a recent electrocardiogram (ECG) for cardiac patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General screening and health counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with well-compensated heart disease can travel without difficulty. A variety of practical tips for the cardiopulmonary patient traveling by air are found in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52930 \">table 1</a>). A discussion of air travel for patients with heart disease is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude, air travel, and heart disease&quot;, section on 'Air travel'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have had a stroke should be observed for stability prior to travel. We advise a minimum two-week period for this observation; earlier travel may be reasonable for stable patients at the discretion of their neurologist. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with clinically significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or other pulmonary or cardiopulmonary disease can be severely compromised by the decreased availability of oxygen in the air at higher altitudes that occurs aboard commercial flights and should be evaluated for the need for supplemental oxygen. Other pulmonary contraindications to flight include severe, unstable asthma, or asthma that required hospitalization within six weeks, and incompletely resolved pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traveling with oxygen aboard commercial air carriers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-distance travel, either by air or land, confers a small increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). A discussion of factors that increase this risk, as well as interventions to prevent or prophylax VTE, is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adult-travelers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult travelers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant passengers should check with the airline carrier for specific details regarding flying restrictions. Pregnancy and air travel are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs#H923931021\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Patient education, health promotion, and safety of commonly used drugs&quot;, section on 'Airline travel'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with certain communicable diseases or who are reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease that would be a threat to others (eg, Ebola) are prohibited from flying. (See <a href=\"#H2205664654\" class=\"local\">'Infections that prohibit travel'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active pulmonary tuberculosis is a contraindication to air travel until there is objective evidence of effective treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1281309370\" class=\"local\">'Tuberculosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with upper respiratory infections (URIs) who cannot avoid flying may benefit from an oral decongestant taken before flight and a nasal spray containing a vasoconstrictor used 30 minutes before descent. Air travel is contraindicated for patients with severe sinusitis, recent facial surgery, or recurrent severe epistaxis. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Upper respiratory infection and ear barotrauma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Nasal and sinus disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should postpone air travel until at least 10 to 14 days after most open surgical procedures. This delay should provide enough time for air in the intrathoracic, intraabdominal, or other cavities to be resorbed and reduces the risk for barotrauma. Patients who have undergone a colonoscopy should wait at least 24 hours before flying. Patients who have had intraocular retinal surgery within eight weeks need to consult with their ophthalmologist before flying. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Surgery and procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hemoglobin below 8.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> generally should be given supplemental oxygen, unless the anemia is known to be well-compensated.
