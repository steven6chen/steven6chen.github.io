(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas#H261416033\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;, section on 'Histopathologic and molecular classification'</a>.)</p><p>Although incidence rates for primary brain and central nervous system cancers were increasing through the late 1980s, the rates have been decreasing by approximately 0.2 percent annually over the past 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among the factors that contributed to the early increase in rates were the introduction of noninvasive diagnostic technology including computerized tomography (CT) in the 1970s and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the 1980s, better health care access for older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incidence of primary brain tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These data, in conjunction with evidence suggesting the increase may have been occurring for many decades, leave open the possibility that environmental exposures may account for the increasing incidence of brain tumors. &#160;</p><p>General risk factors that have been associated with brain tumors are discussed here. A number of putative risk factors for brain tumors have been examined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69121\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69121 \">table 1</a>). A shortcoming in many reports is the tendency to group all brain tumors together; this approach may miss important exposures for specific histopathologic types of tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology of meningioma and its associated risk factors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meningioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of meningioma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three types of radiation have been studied in relation to risk of brain tumor: ionizing radiation, electromagnetic (EM) radiation, and radiofrequency (RF) radiation. Meningeal cells appear to be particularly susceptible to the effects of ionizing radiation. By contrast, the data do not support an important role for EM and RF radiation as risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Ionizing radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exposure to ionizing radiation, as occurs from therapeutic radiation therapy or among atomic bomb survivors, has been established as a cause of brain tumors, including meningiomas, gliomas, and nerve sheath tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The latency between irradiation and the development of brain tumors may be as short as five years or as long as many decades. Higher doses of irradiation are associated with both an increased risk of developing a secondary brain tumor and a shorter latency period.</p><p>Effective treatment of primary brain tumors, acute leukemia, and other tumors has allowed patients to survive for extended periods, thereby placing them at risk for secondary malignancies. This association has been demonstrated for both meningiomas and gliomas. The risk is higher for meningioma than glioma and does not appear to plateau over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, glioma was diagnosed in 40 patients (0.3 percent), with the diagnosis being made at a median follow-up of nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Gliomas occurred in 24 patients who had leukemia and eight with a previous brain tumor. The primary risk factor was antecedent radiation (odds ratio [OR] 6.8, compared with survivors who had not received cranial radiation). The risk of developing glioma was greatest in children who were irradiated before age five years, and was not related to other forms of treatment or the underlying diagnosis.</p><p>The combination of prophylactic cranial irradiation with antimetabolite therapy has resulted in a much higher incidence of second tumors in survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia. As an example, brain tumors occurred in 6 of 52 children (13 percent) treated with combined therapy, compared with no brain tumors in 101 children who did not receive radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Three of the six children had a genetic defect in thiopurine metabolism that resulted in higher levels of the active metabolite of 6-mercaptopurine.</p><p>Lower doses of radiation are also important. The relationship of exposure of the brain and skull to lower doses of irradiation (eg, treatment of tinea capitis) is clearly linked to the subsequent development of meningiomas and other brain tumors. The relationship of irradiation and meningioma is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meningioma#H364101638\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of meningioma&quot;, section on 'Ionizing radiation'</a>.)</p><p>Childhood exposure to diagnostic head computed tomography (CT) may also be associated with an increased risk of brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging#H244757\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;, section on 'Pediatrics'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Electromagnetic radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer was first associated with exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) in 1979 when it was reported that children dying from cancer resided more often in homes believed to be exposed to higher EMF than did healthy control children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The risks were as high as 2.2 for all cancers, 3.0 for leukemia and 2.4 for brain cancers. Wire configuration around houses was used as a surrogate for direct EMF exposure measurements. Twenty-one other studies of EM radiation exposure of variable methodology have reported odds ratios from 0.3 to 13.1 and standardized mortality ratios ranging from 114 to 340 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Other observations have cast doubt on the possibility that EM radiation causes brain tumors. Biologic plausibility has yet to be established, subsequent studies have reported conflicting results, and the probable roles of bias and confounding in these earlier studies have been emphasized. Many of the above studies have used wire configuration around houses as a surrogate for direct EMF exposure measurements. However, studies using more rigorous methodology, including direct, in-home measurement of EM radiation, have concluded that a large effect of this type of radiation on the risk of adult brain tumors can be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>]. Similarly, there is no evidence that exposure of children or pregnant women to magnetic fields from high current power lines, electric heating sources, or electric appliances is associated with the subsequent occurrence of brain tumors in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. Analyses of occupational exposure to magnetic fields have also failed to establish a relationship to the risk of brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular telephones and radiofrequency radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cellular telephones are a source of radiofrequency radiation exposure that have received coverage in the popular media as potential risk factors for brain tumors, presumably due to exposure of the head of the user to radiofrequency energy. Other sources of radiofrequency radiation exposure include microwave and radar equipment and occupational exposures (sealers, plastic welders, amateur radio operators, medical personnel, and telecommunications workers). Exposures to radiofrequency energy are difficult to quantify, even under laboratory conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Numerous epidemiologic studies have looked for a possible relationship between cellular telephone use and the development of brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. A meta-analysis that included data from 22 case control series concluded that there was a slight increase in risk associated with cell phone use in those studies where investigators were blinded to whether the participant was a case or a control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, the risk appeared to be associated with an induction period of 10 years or longer. </p><p>However, many if not all of these studies could have other biases and the data are not conclusive. Furthermore, biologic plausibility is lacking for such an association. The World Health Organization <span class=\"nowrap\">(WHO)/International</span> Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, analyses considering changes in incidence rates over time, prevalence of mobile phone use, and latency period provide no support for causal associations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3484722488\"><span class=\"h1\">OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large number of studies have been conducted to examine whether occupational exposures are associated with the risk of brain tumors. Although some positive associations have been reported, there are many inconsistencies in the literature and results are often difficult to interpret given numerous methodologic issues.</p><p>Evidence suggests that professionals tend to have a higher risk of brain tumors, although the elevated risk may be a consequence of detection bias due to better access to care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Agriculture workers, especially those exposed to herbicides and pesticides, may also have elevated risk of brain tumors; farming as an occupation and place of residence have been associated with a 1.3 to 3.6-fold increased risk of brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-31</a>]. </p><p>Many studies have focused on electrical, rubber, and petroleum workers, where earlier studies had detected strong positive associations; however, the overall findings from these studies do not provide strong support for positive associations. No excess mortality from brain cancer was detectable in a meta-analysis summarizing risk estimates from 20 studies of rubber workers (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79-1.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Similarly, at least two meta-analyses have found no significant overall increase in brain cancer mortality in petroleum workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Finally, for electrical workers, while a number of studies suggested that individuals in electrical occupations were at increased risk of brain tumors, with relative risks ranging between 1.5 and 2.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/35-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-41</a>], other studies did not confirmed these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/2,11,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">HEAD TRAUMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anecdotal descriptions of brain tumors arising after head trauma date back to the reports of Harvey Cushing in 1922 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A number of other observations have implicated head trauma as a potential risk factor for brain tumors. The evidence is strongest for meningiomas and less convincing for gliomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-meningioma#H3019873629\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features, and diagnosis of meningioma&quot;, section on 'Others'</a>.)</p><p>Evidence for other types of brain tumors includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort study of 228,055 Danish residents hospitalized for head injury and followed for an average of eight years, there were increases in the risk of brain tumor with only hemangioblastoma and hemangioma reaching significance (SIR = 2.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Childhood brain tumors may be more common in firstborn children (higher risk of birth trauma) and in children with documented history of birth trauma (forceps delivery, prolonged labor, cesarean section) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, other studies of childhood brain tumors have not confirmed an increased risk among these groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>Studies of head trauma and brain tumors may be confounded by ionizing radiation since individuals with a history of head trauma are more likely to have had exposure to ionizing radiation in the form of skull x-rays. Recall bias is another factor complicating interpretation of case-control studies of head trauma and risk of brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Persons with brain tumors may be more likely to recall minor and major episodes of head injury than controls. As an example, one study reporting an overall positive association between head trauma and the risk of brain tumors found no association when the definition of head trauma was restricted to episodes which required medical attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>One particular type of brain tumor, vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma, a nerve sheath tumor of the <span class=\"nowrap\">VIII/auditory</span> cranial nerve), was associated with acoustic trauma (exposure to extremely loud noise) of 10 years duration in a case-control study (OR = 2.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Noise exposure was based upon a blinded review of job histories. A dose relationship was observed in this study as twenty or more years of exposure was associated with an odds ratio 13.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Experimental studies of tissue destruction and repair following acoustic trauma support the biologic plausibility of this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLERGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence supports a decreased incidence of glioma in adults with a reported history of allergies (eg, asthma, eczema, hay fever).</p><p>This relationship was initially observed in large observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis based upon 3450 patients diagnosed with glioma provided further support for this relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. There was a decrease in the incidence of glioma in patients with a history of any form of allergy (relative risk 0.61, 95% CI 0.55-0.67). Similar, statistically significant risk reductions were observed when the risk of glioma was analyzed for individuals with either asthma or eczema. In comparison, significant relationship to allergy was not observed among 1070 patients with meningioma.</p><p>Several large epidemiologic studies have examined the relationship between serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and the risk of malignant brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-59</a>]. In the largest prospective study to date, samples from 594 blood donors who subsequently developed a glioma (including 374 with glioblastoma) were compared with 1177 paired controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. An inverse relationship was present for total IgE and risk of glioma among men and women; elevated total IgE was associated with a 25 percent decrease in risk of glioma, compared with low total IgE level (odds ratio [OR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.56-0.99, comparing &gt;100 to &lt;100 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> total IgE). Furthermore, the association was present for at least 20 years before the diagnosis of glioma. These findings are consistent with previous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/56,57,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57,59</a>] and provide strong support for the allergy hypothesis.</p><p>Increased immune surveillance in patients with allergies has been postulated as a possible explanation of these observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. More research is underway to understand the underlying mechanisms which might explain these associations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary constituents associated with an increased risk of brain tumors include N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) and possibly dietary fat intake. Aspartame ingestion has been suggested as a possible risk but there are at present insufficient data to support this claim. Ingestion of antioxidants, fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of brain tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">N-nitroso compounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>N-nitroso compounds are potent neurocarcinogens in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Human exposure to these agents occurs from both endogenous and exogenous sources.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exogenous &ndash; The major exogenous sources of population exposures to N-nitroso compounds include tobacco smoke, cosmetics, automobile interiors, and cured meats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Other sources include rubber products (baby pacifiers, bottle nipples) and certain drugs including antihistamines, diuretics, oral hypoglycemic agents, antibiotics, tranquilizers, and opiates. N-nitrosodiethanolamine, a carcinogen in animal models, occurs mainly as a contaminant in cosmetic products, soaps, shampoos, and hand lotions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endogenous &ndash; Endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds is a complex process that occurs in the stomach, and is dependent upon the presence of NOC precursors, gastric pH, the presence of bacteria, and other physiologic parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, measurement of exposure to endogenous NOCs is extremely difficult.</p><p/><p>The many epidemiologic studies that have examined the relationship between meat consumption and brain tumors in adults have produced inconsistent results. </p><p>In the four largest case-control studies, all of which included over 200 patients diagnosed with glioma and appropriate controls, and some assessment of meat intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>], two reported a significant two- to threefold increased risk of glioma for high consumers of cured meat or bacon, as compared with those with a low intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. However, excess risks were only observed among men and, in one, the relative risks were for high intake of cured meat in combination with low fruit and vegetable intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. A meta-analysis that included nine observational studies (primarily case-control studies) reported a relative risk of 1.48 (95% CI 1.20-1.83) for adult glioma among individuals with a high intake of cured meat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Two more recent publications using data from prospective cohort studies found no associations with meat intake or dietary N-nitroso compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Both studies had over 300 glioma cases and detailed dietary assessment to examine these exposures and their potential relation to glioma risk. The lack of association in these two large prospective studies cast doubt on the N-nitroso compound hypothesis, at least in relation to adult glioma risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Antioxidants, fruits, and vegetables</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indirect support for the NOC hypothesis includes the observation that certain inhibitors of the nitrosation process, vitamins C and E, appear to reduce brain tumor risk in adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/11,47,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,47,68</a>]. Dietary studies have demonstrated a reduced risk of brain tumors in children who consume increased amounts of fruits and fruit juices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Prenatal vitamin supplementation (including vitamins A and C and folate) and increased maternal intake of vegetables have been associated with a lowered brain tumor risk in the offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>].</p><p>However, most epidemiologic studies on adult brain tumors contain limited dietary assessment and few questions to explore the relationship between intake of fruits, vegetables and vitamins and the risk of glioma. Of the nine case-control studies that include data on vitamin C intake from dietary sources <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supplements, two reported a statistically significant inverse association between intake of supplemental vitamin C and glioma risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/64,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,71</a>]. In a third report, patients who reported ever using supplemental vitamin C had a relative risk of glioma of 0.2, but this association did not reach the level of statistically significance, and vitamin C intake from foods was unrelated to risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Others report an interaction between intake of vitamin C and cured foods, such that men with high intake of cured meat who had a low intake of foods rich in vitamin C had a significant twofold increase in glioma risk relative to those with low cured meat intake and high intake of foods rich in vitamin C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Findings were similar in women, although the increased risk (1.5) did not reach statistic significance.</p><p>As with vitamin C intake, data regarding glioma risk and intake of fruits and vegetables are inconsistent. In some studies, a significant inverse association was observed between glioma risk and total fruit <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vegetable intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/61,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,73</a>] (which in one study was limited to women only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]), but three others report no association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/72,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,74,75</a>]. Of the six studies with data on vitamin E intake, four report an inverse association with glioma risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/47,62,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,62,72,73</a>], three of which were statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-brain-tumors/abstract/47,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,72,73</a>].
