TIAs happen when an artery in the brain gets clogged, or closes off, and then reopens on its own. This can happen if a blood clot forms and then moves away or dissolves.</p><p>The symptoms of a TIA are the same as the symptoms of a stroke and can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness or numbness of the hand, tongue, cheek, face, arm, or leg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble speaking normally or at all</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble seeing clearly with 1 or both eyes</p><p/><p>TIA is sometimes called a &quot;mini-stroke.&quot; This is because a TIA is just like a stroke, except that a stroke causes long-lasting symptoms, while a TIA goes away quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25943231\"><span class=\"h1\">What is the difference between TIA and stroke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A TIA does not cause permanent damage to the brain like a stroke does. But the symptoms are the same. This can make it hard to tell if a person is having a TIA or a stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25943246\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes a TIA?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Just like a stroke, a TIA can happen when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off for a short time. This can happen if a blood clot blocks the flow of blood through an artery in the brain and then dissolves or moves away. It can also happen if one of the small arteries in the brain begins to close off from the effects of high blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25943261\"><span class=\"h1\">How can you tell if someone is having a TIA?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of a TIA are the same as the symptoms of a stroke. There is an easy way to remember the signs of a stroke. Just think of the word &quot;FAST&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73487 \">figure 1</a>). Each letter in the word stands for 1 of the signs you should watch for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>F</strong>ace &ndash; Does the person's face look uneven or droop on 1 side?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong>rm &ndash; Does the person have weakness or numbness in 1 or both arms? Does 1 arm drift down if the person tries to hold both arms out?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>S</strong>peech &ndash; Is the person having trouble speaking? Does his or her speech sound strange?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>T</strong>ime &ndash; If you notice any of these stroke signs, <strong>even if they go away</strong>, call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1). You need to act FAST. The sooner treatment begins, the better the chances of recovery.</p><p/><p>In the hospital, doctors can do tests to look for problems in the brain, blood vessels, and heart. This can help them choose the right treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25943276\"><span class=\"h1\">What is the risk of stroke after TIA?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person who has had a TIA is at high risk of having a stroke. This risk is highest in the first few days to weeks after the TIA. That is why it is so important to get medical attention right away if you think you (or someone else) might have had a TIA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25943291\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a TIA treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TIAs are not usually treated directly. Instead, treatments are directed at reducing the risk that a person will go on to have a full-blown stroke. To lower your risk of stroke, you should:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take your medicines exactly as directed. Medicines that are especially important in preventing strokes include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines to lower blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines called statins, which lower cholesterol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines to prevent blood clots, such <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or blood thinners</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines that help to keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible (if you have diabetes)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make lifestyle changes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stop smoking, if you smoke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Get regular exercise (if your doctor says it's safe) for at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and low in meats, sweets, and refined grains (such as white bread or white rice)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eat less salt (sodium)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Limit the amount of alcohol you drink</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If you are a woman, do not drink more than 1 drink a day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If you are a man, do not drink more than 2 drinks a day</p><p/><p>Another way to prevent strokes is to have surgery to reopen clogged arteries in the neck. This surgery is appropriate for only a small group of people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25943342\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-an-ischemic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after an ischemic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-artery-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Carotid artery disease (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-ischemic-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Transient ischemic attack (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ischemic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
