Despite adjunctive pharmacologic therapy with antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, early thrombotic reocclusion occurs in 5 to 10 percent of patients before hospital discharge and in up to 25 percent by three months in studies prior to the use of dual antiplatelet therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Early reinfarction occurs in 3 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Reocclusion is clinically silent in over 50 percent of cases.</p><p>Whether symptomatic or silent, reocclusion is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in both the short and long term. Among 810 patients evaluated by the TAMI study group, the in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher in those with reocclusion (11 versus 4 percent with a patent coronary artery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a study of 20,101 patients enrolled in the TIMI trials, the increase in mortality with early reocclusion persisted at two years (19.6 versus 10.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Thus, percutaneous coronary intervention is often recommended even in clinically stable patients after fibrinolysis.

However, one large series did find that clinical predictors of reinfarction included advanced age, shorter time to fibrinolysis, nonsmoking status, prior infarction or angina, female sex, anterior infarction, and lower systolic blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF FIBRINOLYSIS IN REOCCLUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fibrinolysis itself may be important in reocclusion, based on the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During fibrinolysis, thrombin bound to fibrin is released locally into the circulation.

If such <strong>angiographic</strong> risk factors could be identified, adjunctive pharmacologic or mechanical strategies might be applied selectively in this subset of high-risk patients. The notion that certain coronary lesion morphologies are associated with subsequent vessel closure is well supported by studies of patients with unstable angina in whom intraluminal thrombus and lesion eccentricity appear to predispose to the subsequent development of vessel occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>].

The plaque contains collagen and a lipid-rich core that is a repository for macrophage-derived tissue factor (thromboplastin), one of the most potent activators of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of the vulnerable plaque in acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lesion ulceration is also an important risk factor for reocclusion after fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/10,16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16,23</a>]. One study, for example, examined the relationship of several morphologic features of infarct-related lesions to reocclusion in 72 patients who underwent angiography one to eight days after treatment with streptokinase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. An &quot;ulceration index&quot; was calculated based upon the depth of the ulcer. Clinical instability, eg, unstable angina, developed in 58 percent of patients with an ulceration index &gt;6 versus only 8 percent of those with a lower index (p&lt;0.001).</p><p>Another report evaluated the angiographic findings in 47 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although the baseline angiogram was not predictive, all of the patients with recurrent ischemia had complex lesions on angiography performed 24 hours after therapy and none had a <span class=\"nowrap\">concentric/hourglass</span> lesion morphology; in contrast, 44 percent of the patients who remained free of clinical events had concentric narrowings (p = 0.016).</p><p>Thus, the presence of ulceration appears to identify a disrupted and thrombogenic lesion with an enhanced susceptibility to reocclusion. Paradoxically, complete fibrinolysis may increase the risk of reocclusion by re-exposing the original ruptured plaque. Ulcerated lesions are associated with a large transcardiac release of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), which may reflect ulceration-induced platelet activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, platelet aggregation within ulcerated plaques can lead to both thrombotic occlusion and distal embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">High grade residual stenosis and reduced lumen area</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Residual stenosis consists of persistent, nonocclusive thrombus and ruptured atheromatous plaque. The thrombus contains large amounts of thrombin substrate and is a highly thrombogenic surface, increasing platelet deposition two- to fourfold compared with adjacent areas of endothelium. Thrombolytic studies involving patients treated with either streptokinase or APSAC have shown that the presence of a high grade residual stenosis is one of the stronger predictors of recurrent ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>].</p><p>The APRICOT study, which involved 300 patients, found that a visual stenosis &gt;90 percent was an independent predictor of reocclusion with an odds ratio of 2.3 (p = 0.006) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A small minimum lumen area is also associated with an increased incidence of reocclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictors-of-coronary-artery-reocclusion-following-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

The presence of competitive flow from collaterals might contribute rheologically to post-stenotic flow reversal and turbulence, which could facilitate thrombosis or clot propagation along the trailing edge of the lesion.
