In infants and young children, parainfluenza viruses are the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Lower respiratory infections (eg, bronchiolitis, interstitial pneumonitis, pneumonia) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants during the first year of life in the United States and in children younger than the age of six years in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In adults, parainfluenza viruses generally cause mild upper respiratory infections (URIs) but can induce more severe disease in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Immunocompromised patients, particularly lung and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients can experience life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections with parainfluenza virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>The virology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of parainfluenza viruses in children will be reviewed here. Infection with parainfluenza viruses in adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parainfluenza-viruses-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parainfluenza viruses in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are single-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses belonging to the genus paramyxovirus in the <em>Paramyxoviridae </em>family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This family also includes human mumps, measles, and respiratory syncytial viruses and metapneumoviruses, as well as avian, bovine, and murine strains of these viruses.</p><p>The virions are pleomorphic and range in diameter from 150 to 200 nm. The single strand of negative-sense RNA is 15,462 nucleotides in length and encodes six common viral proteins: the nucleocapsid protein (NP), the phosphoprotein (P), the matrix protein (M), the fusion glycoprotein (F), the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein (HN), and the RNA polymerase (L) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The HN and F proteins project through the lipid envelope and form the major antigenic targets for neutralizing antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Their hydrophobic tails project into the virion, where they interact with the M protein to aid in virus assembly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nucleocapsid core is composed of NP, P, and L proteins in association with viral RNA. NP proteins bind tightly to the viral genome, creating a template for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase composed of the P and L proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>The HN glycoproteins are involved in attachment of the virus to the host cell via interactions with sialic acid residues on the cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This interaction allows the F protein to mediate virus-cell membrane fusion, which is required for nucleocapsid entry and infection of the host cell. The neuraminidase portion of the HN protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] mediates budding of progeny virions from the surface of infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In addition, each parainfluenza virus expresses at least one non-essential protein: PIV1 and PIV3 RNA encode short C proteins, PIV2 RNA encodes a V protein, and PIV 3 also expresses a D protein. The C and V proteins inhibit the host innate immune response (host cell antiviral responses) by suppressing the activity of type I interferons; the function of the D protein is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral serotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four major serotypes of human PIV (PIV-1, 2, 3, 4) have been described based upon complement fixation and hemagglutinating antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV-5) causes disease in animals (dogs, cats, pigs) but its role in human disease remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>PIV-3 is the most prevalent serotype, with 90 to 100 percent of children demonstrating antibody responses by age five [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, PIV-1 and PIV-2 infections are less common, with only 50 to 74 percent of five-year-olds demonstrating seropositivity. Fifty percent of six-year-old children and 70 to 90 percent of young adults have antibodies to PIV-4, despite the fact that infection is infrequently recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. PIV-1 particularly and PIV-2 are associated with croup in children, whereas PIV-3 is frequently associated with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in young infants. PIV-4 typically causes mild upper respiratory infection (URI) in both adults and children, but pneumonia and bronchiolitis have been described in infants and in children with underlying conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) initially infect epithelial cells of the nose and oropharynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and then spread distally to the ciliated and alveolar cells of the bronchial epithelium of large and small airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Significant viral replication is seen in the nose and lungs 24 hours after infection, with viral replication peaking after two to five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Viral antigen can be detected in the apical portion of respiratory epithelial cells from days one to six of infection, with a decrease on day seven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The extent of infection correlates well with disease: mild upper respiratory infections (URIs) are associated with limited infection of the nasopharynx, whereas more severe disease involves spread of infection to the large and small airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. PIV-1 and PIV-2, which are associated with croup, tend to infect the larynx and upper trachea, whereas PIV-3, which is associated with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, infects the distal airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Progression to the lower respiratory tract and severity of disease depend upon factors such as virus titer in the upper respiratory tract, previous exposure to the specific virus, and genetic susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/9,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,31,32</a>].</p><p>Pathologic examination of infected tissues in animal models of PIV infection suggests that minimal cellular or tissue damage is caused by direct viral effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Similarly, PIV infection does not result in extensive cytopathic effect in in vitro models of respiratory airway epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/16,27,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,27,33</a>]. As is the case with other respiratory viruses, the host immune response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PIV infection. PIV induces innate immune responses, CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses, interferon production, and local and systemic immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG responses, which contribute to the clearing of the virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/28,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,34</a>]. The increase in airway responsiveness that often is associated with PIV-3 infection (and other respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]) may result from IgE, increased stromal interleukin-11 production and enhanced acetylcholine release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Preliminary experiments in animal models of infection suggest that a &quot;two-pronged&quot; approach to therapy, antiviral and anti-inflammatory, may be useful in PIV-related illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13729171\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL IMMUNITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Natural immunity to parainfluenza virus is incomplete, and reinfection is common; however, reinfections tend to be milder than initial infection and restricted to the upper respiratory tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Antibodies are produced to all viral proteins, although only antibodies to the surface proteins, HN and F, are neutralizing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. T cell immunity contributes to viral clearance and confers transient resistance to reinfection, albeit short lived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/16,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) are transmitted by direct person-to-person contact and through exposure to contaminated nasopharyngeal secretions through respiratory droplets and fomites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Incubation period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incubation period ranges from two to six days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human PIV are recovered most commonly in children younger than five years of age with upper respiratory infections (URIs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/3,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,42</a>]. Serologic studies have shown that as many as 50 percent of children have been infected with PIV-3 by their first birthday, whereas PIV-1 and PIV-2 most often affect preschool-aged children three to five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In population-based surveillance, PIV-1, 2, or 3 were identified in 8 percent of 7716 specimens obtained from pediatric outpatients with influenza-like illness between August 2010 and July 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Among these, 30 percent were PIV-1, 26 percent PIV-2, and 44 percent PIV-3. The annual incidence of each serotype varied between 88 and 100 per 100,000 children. In children younger than five years, the incidence of PIV was 259 to 1307 per 100,000. The median age at detection was lower for PIV-3 (3.4 years) than for PIV-1 (4.5 years) and PIV-2 (7.0 years).</p><p>PIV infections account for 20 to 40 percent of lower respiratory tract illnesses (eg, bronchiolitis, pneumonia) in children from which a virus is recoverable, and 2.8 per 1000 children with such infections require hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. PIV is responsible for approximately 30,000 (range 7600 to 48,000) pediatric hospitalizations annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A study based upon the National Hospital Discharge survey from 1994 through 1997 estimated hospitalization rates due to PIV-1 to 3 to range from 1.9 to 12 per 1000 children younger than one year and from 0.5 to 2.0 per 1000 children ages one to four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The highest overall hospitalization rates were for PIV-3, estimated at 0.48 to 2.6 per 1000 children. A population-based study in the United States (2000 to 2004) estimated that PIV accounts for up to 7 percent of all hospitalizations for fever, acute respiratory illness, or both in children younger than five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; PIV3 is the cause of one-half of these hospitalizations. Data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS, 1998-2010) indicate an annual estimated PIV-associated hospitalization rate of 0.2 per 1000 children for bronchiolitis, 0.4 per 1000 children for croup, and 0.5 per 1000 children for pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].The majority of PIV-associated hospitalizations occurred in children younger than two years.</p><p>PIV infections occur throughout the world and throughout the year, with certain serotypes predominating during the spring or fall. PIV-1 usually causes outbreaks biennially during the fall of odd-numbered years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56691\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56691 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. In contrast, PIV-2 and PIV-3 occur in annual epidemics in the fall and spring, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. During years in which PIV-1 is not circulating, there is an increase in PIV-3 activity, manifested either as a longer spring PIV-3 season or as a second smaller peak in the fall. Seasonal patterns of PIV-4 infections have not been established, since the disease is usually mild, and the virus is difficult to detect. However, it is diagnosed more frequently between October and January [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In tropical countries, parainfluenza viruses do not exhibit seasonal variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Ethnicity and sex may play roles in the severity of PIV infection. Bronchiolitis occurs most commonly in non-Caucasian males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Breast-fed infants have a reduced risk of serious infection. Spread within families is extensive, requiring only direct person-to-person contact or large droplet inhalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Pneumococcal vaccination has been associated with a reduction in the incidence of pneumonia in infants with PIV and other respiratory virus infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parainfluenza-viruses-in-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This observation suggests that the pneumococcus is an important pathogen in virus-associated pneumonia.

Children initially present with fever, rhinorrhea, and pharyngitis and progress to cough, often &quot;barking&quot; in nature, with stridor, dyspnea, and chest wall retractions.

Four major serotypes of human PIV (PIV-1, 2, 3, 4) have been described. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parainfluenza viruses initially infect epithelial cells of the nose and oropharynx and then spread distally to the large and small airways. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PIV cause a variety of upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses, ranging from mild cold-like syndromes to life-threatening pneumonia. PIV-1 and PIV-2 are associated with croup and PIV-3 with pneumonia and bronchiolitis. PIV-4 typically causes mild upper respiratory infection, but pneumonia and bronchiolitis have been described in infants and in children with underlying conditions. Although most PIV infections are mild, serious complications can occur, particularly in immunocompromised patients. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PIV infection can be made clinically with a compatible presentation during an outbreak of PIV in the community. Laboratory confirmation may be useful in determining if a community outbreak exists or in excluding other infections in seriously ill patients. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no licensed antiviral agents with proven clinical efficacy for PIV infections. PIV infections are generally self-limited and treated with supportive measures. The management of specific clinical syndromes (eg, croup, bronchiolitis) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-approach-to-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Approach to management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Treatment, outcome, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaccine development is ongoing and the outlook is promising, given the availability of reverse genetics technology.
