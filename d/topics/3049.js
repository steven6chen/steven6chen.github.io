Respiratory distress is typically characterized by signs of increased work of breathing, such as tachypnea, use of accessory muscles, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> retractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-respiratory-distress-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Head bobbing, nasal flaring and grunting are additional signs more commonly seen in very young children. A respiratory rate that is inappropriately slow for the clinical condition may also be a sign of respiratory distress, and may portent impending respiratory arrest. An abnormal pattern of respiration is a sign of respiratory distress that may offer clues to etiology.

Neonates, infants, and young children are at particular risk given their high oxygen consumption and decreased respiratory reserve. Children with inadequate respiratory effort (as can occur with fatigue, muscle weakness or CNS depression) can quickly develop significant physiologic compromise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in children: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, children with respiratory distress secondary to altered stimulation of respiratory centers or pain, who do not have significant cardiopulmonary disease or trauma, usually improve with treatment of the primary condition and do not generally progress to respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13169095\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many conditions may cause acute respiratory distress in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61637 \">table 1</a>).

Common causes of severe partial upper airway obstruction include foreign body aspiration, infection (most commonly croup), and injury (such as airway thermal or chemical burns). Causes of acute upper airway obstruction that are commonly life-threatening are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62015 \">table 2</a>).

It is rapidly fatal without immediate decompression.</p><p>Tension pneumothorax is usually due to penetrating or blunt trauma, including mechanical ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation but it can also occur as the result of a spontaneous pneumothorax. Although tension usually develops immediately, it may be delayed for up to 24 hours, particularly if the pneumothorax is spontaneous and develops slowly.</p><p>Hallmarks of tension pneumothorax are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe respiratory distress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shift of mediastinal structures, including the trachea, toward the side contralateral to the collapsed lung</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ipsilateral hyperexpansion of the chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased or absent breath sounds and hyper-resonance to percussion on the ipsilateral side of the collapsed lung</p><p/><p>In the rare patient with bilateral tension pneumothoraces, physical findings may be symmetric. Bedside ultrasound can rapidly confirm the diagnosis of pneumothorax.

If immediately available, a thoracostomy tube or pigtail catheter can be placed in children with a tension pneumothorax without first performing needle thoracostomy only if the tube can be placed without delaying decompression; otherwise needle thoracostomy should be performed immediately, followed by chest tube or pigtail catheter placement as soon as possible.

It is an uncommon condition in children and is often associated with the use of central venous lines or other vascular devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-respiratory-distress-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other risk factors for PE include immobility, a hypercoagulable state (such as factor V Leiden mutation, protein S or protein C deficiency), congenital heart disease, trauma, surgery, nephrotic syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, hormone birth control, malignancy and complications of some chemotherapeutic regimens (such as L-asparaginase and steroids for acute lymphoblastic leukemia).

Cardiac tamponade can present acutely with hypotension. Children may also have signs of respiratory distress or apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-respiratory-distress-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The classic signs of pericardial tamponade, referred to as Beck's triad (hypotension, jugular venous distention, and muffled heart sounds), are present in less than one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-acute-respiratory-distress-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Pulsus paradoxus (a drop in the systolic blood pressure of &gt;10 mmHg upon inspiration and, when severe, a weakening or disappearance of the peripheral pulse upon inspiration) is an indication for emergency pericardiocentesis in children with pericardial effusion. Bedside ultrasound, can be used to rapidly identify fluid in the pericardial sac in patients with cardiac tamponade, and to guide pericardiocentesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulsus-paradoxus-in-pericardial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulsus-paradoxus-in-pericardial-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease&quot;, section on 'Measurement of pulsus paradoxus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulsus-paradoxus-in-pericardial-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease&quot;, section on 'Pulsus paradoxus in cardiac tamponade'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-pericardiocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency pericardiocentesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute cardiac tamponade is rare in children and is usually the result of trauma, particularly penetrating cardiac injury. It is rapidly fatal. In children, accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac is usually caused by infection, inflammation (most commonly collagen vascular disease), malignancy (eg, mediastinal lymphoma), or cardiac surgery (postpericardiotomy syndrome). Accumulation of pericardial fluid due to atraumatic etiology is usually insidious and less likely to progress to tamponade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13169144\"><span class=\"h3\">Other traumatic conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to tension pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade, several other traumatic conditions may cause respiratory distress including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Flail chest</strong> &ndash; Flail chest occurs when multiple rib fractures result in a loss of stability of the chest wall. The flail segment retracts with inspiration and bulges with exhalation, resulting in inefficient expansion of the thorax, inefficient ventilation, and a significant increase in the energy expenditure for breathing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79746\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79746 \">figure 1</a>). The mechanism of injury usually is direct impact. Flail chest is uncommon in children because the greater deformability of immature bone makes rib fractures less likely than in adults, and when present, is often associated with pulmonary contusion. Even without rib fractures, children may have significant pulmonary injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-wall-injuries-after-blunt-trauma-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chest wall injuries after blunt trauma in children&quot;, section on 'Flail chest'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary contusion</strong> &ndash; In children, pulmonary contusion occurs when traumatic force is applied to the chest wall and results in parenchymal damage with hemorrhage and edema. The initial presentation of children with pulmonary contusion is often dominated by clinical features associated with extrathoracic injuries. Nevertheless, pulmonary contusion should be suspected in any child with significant blunt force to the thorax, whether or not there are signs of respiratory distress or chest wall injury. Decreased breath sounds, rales, or rhonchi may be noted on physical examination. Chest radiography should be performed for all children with respiratory distress and may reveal pulmonary contusion. Further imaging with computed tomography (CT) is not indicated for pulmonary contusion unless tracheobronchial, diaphragmatic or vascular injury is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-contusion-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary contusion in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-contusion-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary contusion in children&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pneumothorax</strong>&ndash; Pneumothorax occurs when air leaks from the lungs into the pleural space, resulting in collapse of the lung. It may be caused by blunt or penetrating trauma that creates air leak by directly damaging intrathoracic structures or indirectly due to increased intrathoracic pressure that ruptures respiratory structures. Chest radiograph reveals echogenicity in the region of the uninflated lung. Ultrasound is more sensitive for diagnosis of pneumothorax than chest radiograph. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pneumothorax#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pneumothorax&quot;, section on 'Types of pneumothorax'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Open pneumothorax</strong> &ndash; Pneumothorax due to a traumatic open chest wall wound occurs when ambient air enters the pleural space during inspiration through the chest wall defect (ie, a &quot;sucking wound&quot;). The air filled space causes the lung within the injured hemithorax to collapse and shifts the mediastinum toward the normal hemithorax. During expiration, air exits the pleural space through the chest wall defect and the mediastinum swings back toward the injured hemithorax. Expiratory air from the normal lung (ie, &ldquo;pendulum air&rdquo;) fills the collapsed lung. The &ldquo;mediastinal flutter&quot; may cause respiratory failure. Chest radiograph, an open pneumothorax is characterized by a visible chest wall defect and by massive expiratory mediastinal shift towards the injured side: this mediastinal behavior is different from tension pneumothorax where the expiratory shift of the mediastinum occurs towards the normal lung, resulting from air-trapping in the affected pleural space. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment of open pneumothorax consists of immediately placing a sterile petroleum gauze over the open wound and taping on three sides to allow the dressing to act as a flutter valve that prevents air entry through the wound upon inspiration but allows air to escape during exhalation. A chest tube or pigtail catheter should be placed as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes#H254982395\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;, section on 'Tube thoracostomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemothorax </strong>&ndash; In patients with massive hemothorax, respiratory distress results from the inability of the lung to expand on the affected side and from hemorrhage shock. Thoracostomy tube placement and fluid resuscitation are key interventions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Breathing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Smoke inhalation </strong>&ndash; Smoke inhalation may cause respiratory distress due to thermal injury to the upper and lower airways, hypoxic gas inhalation, bronchopulmonary exposure to toxins with direct lung injury, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic toxicity from carbon monoxide and cyanide. Thermal injury to the upper airway is suggested by stridor, respiratory distress, facial burns, oropharyngeal blisters or edema, and carbonaceous sputum and warrants early endotracheal intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants#H2963368663\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants&quot;, section on 'Subsequent care'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalation-injury-from-heat-smoke-or-chemical-irritants#H3952639976\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants&quot;, section on 'Initial care and disposition'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Submersion injury </strong>&ndash; Children with nonfatal drowning, defined as a process resulting in primary respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in a liquid medium, may have hypoxemia due to fluid aspiration or reflex laryngospasm inducing noncardiogenic pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pulmonary insufficiency can develop insidiously or rapidly. Findings include tachypnea, dyspnea, rales, and wheezing. Chest radiograph may be normal or show focal or diffuse pulmonary edema. Symptoms and radiographs may worsen dramatically within hours.

Although exposure to these agents is fortunately rare, prompt recognition is essential to contain the exposure and prepare for mass casualties. Children often manifest symptoms prior to adults because of greater exposure per unit body mass, particularly since many agents are heavier than air and are therefore at greatest concentration lower to the ground, the level at which children breath, and because children breath at a faster rate and have less compensatory capacity. The respiratory symptoms are typically nonspecific. Biologic agents include inhalational anthrax, pneumonic plague, pneumonic tularemia, melioidosis, and the toxins staphylococcus enterotoxin B and ricin. Chemical agents such as chlorine, phosgene, sarin, ricin and cyanide can also cause respiratory distress.

Patients with peritonsillar abscess exhibit tonsillar and peritonsillar swelling and erythema with deviation of the uvula to the unaffected side. It is rare that the swelling is so severe that it obstructs the oral airway enough to cause difficulty breathing. Peritonsillar abscess is most commonly caused by Group A streptococcus but can be caused by other bacteria and sometimes develops secondary to Epstein-Barr virus (ie, mononucleosis). Peritonsillar abscess is more common in older children and adolescents. The onset of symptoms is typically gradual.

Retropharyngeal abscess is more likely to develop in infants and toddlers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63233\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63233 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51505\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51505 \">image 2</a>). Additional findings include drooling, dysphagia, torticollis, meningismus, and change in voice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retropharyngeal-infections-in-children#H2087948778\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retropharyngeal infections in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Croup</strong> &ndash; Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) is the most common infectious cause of upper airway obstruction in children between 6 and 36 months of age but can occur from early infancy through school age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64727\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64727 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52418\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52418 \">image 4</a>). The etiology is usually viral (most commonly due to infection with parainfluenza virus). Spasmodic croup, also referred to as allergic croup is a noninfectious form of croup thought to be allergy medicated, given it is seen most often in patients with atopic disease. Most patients with spasmodic croup are older than those with infectious croup and many have recurrent episodes (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The onset of symptoms with croup due to infection is usually gradual, beginning with nasal congestion, and coryza. Symptoms generally progress over 12 to 48 hours to include fever, usually &lt;39&deg;C although may be higher especially if due to influenza, hoarseness, barking cough, and stridor. Onset of spasmodic croup is abrupt and symptoms are limited to barky cough. Barky cough, for infectious or spasmodic croup, most commonly begins during the night or with napping. Respiratory distress increases as upper airway obstruction becomes more severe. Rapid progression or signs of lower airway involvement suggests a more serious illness. Symptoms of viral croup typically persist for three to seven days with resolution of barky cough by day four in most children, with influenza causing more protracted illness than other viruses. Deviations from this expected course should prompt consideration of diagnoses other than laryngotracheitis. Spasmodic croup usually remits more quickly, sometimes within hours. Some children with severe or recurrent croup may have underlying airway abnormalities (eg, subglottic hemangioma).

Classically, it is caused by bacteria, most commonly <em>Streptococcus</em> or <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> including MRSA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55364\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55364 \">picture 2</a>) as a secondary infection in a child with croup (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80331\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80331 \">image 5</a>) but may occur as a primary infection. Increasingly, cases due to viral infection or cases in which no pathogen is identified have been reported. Patients with tracheitis may have rapid, dramatic and often transient decreases in oxygen saturation. In patients with respiratory failure due to upper airway infection, tracheitis is more common than epiglottitis or croup. The predominant clinical features of tracheitis are those of airway obstruction: stridor, cough, and respiratory distress accompanied by fever, highest in patients with bacterial or influenza as the etiology. Children younger than two to three years of age may be at increased risk for severe disease because of their relatively narrow airway diameter. In children with signs of total or near-total airway obstruction, airway control precedes diagnostic evaluation.

It is characterized by several days of upper airway symptoms, most classically nasal congestion and copious nasal secretions, followed by onset of lower airway symptoms that include wheezing, rales, rhonchi, and cough. Neonates and very young infants may have apnea, and it may be the presenting manifestation. Peak severity of illness is usually between days 4 and 6 with resolution of symptoms between days 10 and 14. A detailed review of bronchiolitis can be found separately.

In comparison, foreign body in the lower airway, most commonly manifests as unilateral wheeze, but presentation may be delayed days to weeks and manifest as fever, rales, or cough due to infection.
