It is a functional definition, implying a significant amount of malabsorption of both macronutrients and micronutrients, rather than a definition based upon on the loss of a specific segment or length of bowel. </p><p>The most common causes of SBS include necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), congenital intestinal atresia (single or multiple), gastroschisis, volvulus (midgut or segmental), extensive Hirschsprung disease, and inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. SBS due to surgical resection is the most common cause of intestinal failure, which is the state when an individual's gastrointestinal function is inadequate to maintain nutrient, growth and hydration status without intravenous or enteral supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition to SBS, causes of intestinal failure in children include intestinal motility disorders (ie, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction) and intestinal epithelial defects (ie, congenital enterocyte disorders). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;, section on 'Congenital secretory diarrheas'</a>.)</p><p>The type and severity of clinical manifestations of SBS vary widely among patients, even among those with similar etiologies and with roughly similar anatomic features. Depending on the patient's age, underlying diagnosis, and the quantity and location of affected bowel, patients with SBS may have any combination of the following problems: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive fluid and electrolyte losses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to absorb adequate energy and macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fats) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to absorb necessary vitamins and minerals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor weight <span class=\"nowrap\">gain/growth</span> failure</p><p/><p>Because of progressive intestinal adaptation, many patients eventually are able to transition off of parenteral nutrition (PN) to full enteral feeds (&quot;enteral autonomy&quot;), and some even achieve full oral feeding. During the past two decades, advances in medical care have resulted in reduced mortality, shorter duration of PN, and better weight gain for infants with SBS compared with previous cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Outcomes of SBS have also improved because of improvements in the prevention or management of the long-term complications of SBS, such as intestinal failure-associated liver disease and central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>An overview of the management of pediatric patients with SBS is provided here. The pathogenesis of this disorder and the chronic complications that may occur, including intestinal failure-associated liver disease, gallstones, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, and hyperoxaluria with kidney stones, are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1885633\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of SBS vary, in part because of differences in the case definition used across studies. An arbitrary, but generally agreed upon, case definition of SBS in infancy has been the need (or anticipated need) for parenteral nutrition (PN) for &ge;90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], although some sources use other cut points, such as &ge;60 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Using a variety of definitions, the incidence of SBS has been estimated at approximately 0.02 to 0.1 percent among all live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], 0.5 to 2.0 percent among neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>], and 0.7 percent among very low birthweight infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Approximately 80 percent of pediatric SBS cases develop during the neonatal period. </p><p>The Pediatric Intestinal Failure Consortium conducted a multi-center review of 272 pediatric SBS patients managed in several centers in North America between 2004 and 2007, and reported the following causes: necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (26 percent), gastroschisis (16 percent), intestinal atresias (10 percent), volvulus (9 percent), aganglionosis (4 percent), and other single or multiple diagnoses (18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The incidence of NEC depends on birth weight, with those neonates between 500 and 750 g having a 12 percent incidence of this condition, and 3 percent decreases in NEC for each 250 g increase in birthweight &gt;750 grams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An increasing trend in the incidence of gastroschisis has been reported worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroschisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroschisis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Estimated mortality rates for infants and children with SBS vary substantially both between institutions and over time. A report representing the collective experience of 14 pediatric centers in North America between 2000 and 2007 describes a mortality rate of 27 percent, an intestinal transplant rate of 26 percent, and an enteral autonomy achievement rate of 47 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Improvements in SBS survival have been described over time, with mortality rates falling from 20 to 40 percent to 10 percent or less in more recent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Predictors of survival vary among studies, but include participation in a multi-disciplinary program for intestinal rehabilitation, residual bowel length, PN independence, and lower direct bilirubin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. PN dependence remains the most important risk factor for potentially fatal complications of SBS including intestinal failure-associated liver disease and sepsis. Therefore, optimal management of SBS to reduce the need for PN is essential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LIKELIHOOD OF WEANING FROM PN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A substantial portion of patients with SBS will be able to wean from PN and achieve &quot;enteral autonomy&quot; if given sufficient time and support to facilitate bowel adaptation. It is difficult to predict with certainty which patients will achieve this goal. Factors that predict the likelihood of success include longer intestinal length, intact ileocecal valve, and an underlying diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) rather than gastroschisis, atresias or other causes of SBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17-19</a>]. In addition, one study reported a significant advantage of having care at a multidisciplinary intestinal failure center with an institutional philosophy that emphasizes rehabilitation and provides time and support to optimize intestinal adaptation, rather than an institutional philosophy that focuses on early referral to transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Length of remaining small intestine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intestinal length measured immediately after resection is a moderately good predictor of whether a child will become independent from PN. However, reports vary regarding the amount of residual bowel associated with ability to wean from PN, due to difficulty with accurate assessment of intestinal length at the time of surgery, failure to account for premature birth, and the effect of other factors on the clinical course. While important, intestinal length should not be used as the sole predictor of whether the child will be able to achieve enteral autonomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H2285795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Small intestine length'</a>.)</p><p>Small bowel length increases over the course of gestation and also for the first several years of life. Thus, gestational age should be considered when evaluating residual small bowel length in premature infants. Small bowel length in infants and children during the first five years of life has been reported at a mean of 70 cm (SE 6.3) at 24 to 26 weeks postconception, 157.4 cm (SE 11.2) at term, and 423.9 cm (SE 5.9) at 49 to 60 months postconception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>The association between bowel length and achievement of enteral autonomy is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study from a single center found significantly higher likelihood of achieving enteral autonomy among infants with residual small bowel length &ge;10 percent of expected small bowel length (hazard ratio [HR] 8.27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A separate study reported cumulative probability of weaning from PN was 96 percent at 24 months in infants with &gt;50 cm of residual small bowel, and 71 percent at 57 months in those with &lt;50 cm of residual small bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study found that patients with &ge;41 cm of residual bowel were significantly more likely to achieve enteral autonomy than those with less than 41 cm; with a 4 percent increase in odds of achieving enteral autonomy for every 1 cm increase in residual small bowel length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p>Despite this strong positive association between residual small bowel length and weaning from PN, some infants with less than 20 cm of small intestine remaining are eventually able to achieve this goal. One study reported that 48 percent of patients with &lt;20 cm of residual small bowel achieved enteral autonomy, with a median time to PN independence of less than two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Segments of remaining intestine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The segment of remaining intestine is important for determining the metabolic consequences of the SBS. In general, patients with an ileal remnant may have better outcomes than those with a jejunal remnant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Site of intestinal resection'</a>.) </p><p>Retaining all or part of the ileum is advantageous for several reasons: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adaptation &ndash; Although the proximal small intestine is primarily responsible for the absorption of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83401\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83401 \">figure 1</a>), the ileum has a remarkable ability to adapt and compensate for absorption of these nutrients after loss of the jejunum. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal adaptation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid absorption &ndash; The ileum is uniquely structured to absorb fluids; patients lacking the ileum are particularly prone to watery diarrhea. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absorption of specific nutrients &ndash; The ileum is critical for absorption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin B12</a> and bile salts. Individuals lacking the terminal ileum malabsorb bile salts, which in turn leads to malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. They may have diarrhea either due to direct effects of the malabsorbed bile salts in the colon (bile acid diarrhea), or due to insufficient bile salts for fat digestion, leading to fat malabsorption (steatorrhea). (See <a href=\"#H11453713\" class=\"local\">'Malabsorption of fat and vitamins'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric emptying &ndash; Unabsorbed lipids reaching the ileum delay gastric emptying, a function known as the &quot;ileal brake.&quot; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barrier function &ndash; Loss of the ileocecal valve is associated with reduced likelihood of weaning from PN and greater complications including small bowel bacterial overgrowth and malabsorption. However, it is unclear whether these associations are independently attributable to the loss of the ileocecal valve, or whether they are mediated by the closely related factors of intestinal length and absence of the ileum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Loss of the ileocecal valve'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Loss of the colon reduces the likelihood of weaning from PN in adults with SBS, but the predictive value of this factor is less clear in children. Studies in infants and children have reached inconsistent conclusions about whether or not the presence of the colon is an important predictor of weaning from PN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/17,18,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,23,24</a>]. Our own clinical experience suggests that retention of all or part of the colon is beneficial for intestinal rehabilitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Loss of the colon'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal adaptation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal adaptation is the process following intestinal resection whereby the remaining bowel undergoes wide range of gross anatomic, cellular and molecular changes that serve to increase its absorptive ability. The clinical course of SBS is strongly influenced by this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The changes include lengthening and dilatation of the bowel, lengthening of the villi and deepening of the crypts, increased synthesis of digestive enzymes, increased proliferation and apoptosis of enterocytes, and changes in gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Factors that enhance intestinal adaptation include direct effects of enteral nutrients on the enterocyte, secondary effects of enteral feeding on hepatobiliary secretions, and trophic gastrointestinal hormones including glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2). The mechanisms and potential mediators of intestinal adaptation are discussed in detail in a separate topic review. The use of specific growth factors to enhance intestinal adaptation is an area of active research in animal models and humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H2321993451\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Intestinal adaptation'</a> and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the first few months after intestinal resection, the predominant goals are maintenance of good nutritional status through administration of parenteral nutrition (PN) and prevention of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048878051\"><span class=\"h2\">Parenteral nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this early phase, the major portion of energy is delivered through PN, but enteral nutrition should be initiated promptly to support intestinal adaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. The principles of prescribing PN to infants and children are discussed in detail in a separate topic review (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;</a>). In patients who will likely require PN for more than three weeks, we commonly restrict soy-based intravenous lipids solutions to a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/kg/day</span> in order to reduce the risk of intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD). Infants with SBS are at particular risk of developing IFALD and therefore should be monitored carefully for this condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3164571914\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large-volume fluid losses from gastric or proximal small bowel secretions are common in the early phase. As a result, patients require rigorous replacement of fluids with sodium, potassium, chloride, and magnesium. </p><p>Fluid and electrolyte losses through an enterostomy or in the feces (if these are &gt;2 mL per kilogram of body weight per hour) should be measured and replaced. Most of the chronic fluid replacement usually can be supplied through PN using a solution that is tailored to the patient's fluid and electrolyte needs. Acute increases in enteral losses may warrant immediate replacement. This should be done with a solution separate from the parenteral nutrition, to allow timely and accurate replacement of the losses. High output ostomy or stool losses can also be replaced with appropriately formulated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a>. These solutions generally contain a suitably designed mix of water, electrolytes, and carbohydrate to replace diarrheal losses. Details of these strategies to manage fluid losses are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Watery diarrhea'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H842897327\"><span class=\"h2\">Acid suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with SBS often exhibit hypersecretion of gastric acid and fluids, which reduces pH below the optimal level needed for fat absorption (by inactivating pancreatic lipase and deconjugating bile salts), alters enteral drug absorption, and increases intestinal fluid losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>We routinely administer acid suppressing medication during the early phase after intestinal resection, to improve nutrient absorption and reduce fluid losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. We typically start with a histamine 2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) given intravenously to suppress gastric hypersecretion. If the medication appears to be effective in reducing fluid losses or improving absorption, acid suppression should be continued for several months. Use of an H2RA may lead to tachyphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]; therefore, if symptoms are insufficiently controlled on an H2RA, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be used. The gastric hypersecretion typically resolves during the first few months after surgery and weaning of the acid suppressing medications should be attempted a few months after the intestinal resection. Patients with persistent symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other forms of peptic disease may require longer courses of acid suppression therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1887329\" class=\"local\">'Antisecretory agents'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Esophagitis/Peptic ulcer disease'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32888166\"><span class=\"h1\">GROWTH GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The resting energy expenditure in infants with SBS is similar to that in healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, because of malabsorption, patients with SBS typically require 30 to 70 percent more calories if they are fed enterally compared with their energy needs from PN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Growth is monitored by assessing whether increases in weight are proportional to linear growth, using standard growth curves for infants, with adjustment for premature birth until two years of age. Additional factors, such as mid-parental height estimates, should also be factored into expectations for growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children#H31542395\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;, section on 'Recommended growth charts'</a>.) </p><p>Infants and children with SBS often have growth failure. In one study, 46 percent of patients had a height-for-age Z-score of less than -2 in one study, and higher rates of growth failure were seen in those with secondary enteropathy or intestinal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Another series examined long-term growth outcomes in 31 children with a history of SBS as infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. At mean age 11.8 years (SD 4.2 years), affected individuals had slightly shorter stature than was expected from calculated target height, and their bone mineral content was lower than reference values. However, the children had normal body fat percentage and normal weight-for-height ratios. A third study of 51 infants with SBS showed a &quot;U shaped curve&quot; for both weight-for-age and length-for-age Z-scores over the first year of life, with a nadir at approximately six months (-2.38 and -2.18 respectively) and near recovery by one year (-0.72 and -0.76, respectively). Inflammatory conditions such as central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections and necrotizing enterocolitis were associated with lower scores on both of these indices of growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Although these and other studies suggest that long term PN-dependence has modest effects on linear growth, many patients achieve normal height. This suggests that secondary factors may contribute to the growth failure observed in some patients, such as intestinal inflammation, corticosteroid use, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aggressive weaning of PN to avoid chronic complications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ENTERAL FEEDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteral feeding is a central goal in management of a patient with SBS. Enteral feeds should be introduced early, and advanced carefully but persistently, as rapidly as tolerated by the patient. A commercially available electrolyte solution for enteral use (eg, Pedialyte) may be a useful adjunct to enteral feeds, to supply additional fluids and electrolytes, especially in children with feeding tubes and high output fluid losses. Our approach to initiating and advancing feeds are summarized in the algorithm and table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108756\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108756 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107910 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Enteral feeding is important for several reasons: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of nutrients in the intestinal lumen is essential to promote intestinal adaptation, and appears to be more effective if enteral feeds are initiated early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. This effect occurs even when only small amounts of feeds are given (sometimes termed &quot;trophic feeds&quot;). Absence of enteral feeding may induce atrophy of the mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H27027264\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Nutrient effects'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As enteral feeds are increased, parenteral nutrition (PN) can be decreased, reducing the risk for complications of long-term PN such as intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) and metabolic bone disease. Other aspects of preventing and managing IFALD include modification of PN lipid dose <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> type, and prevention of small intestine bacterial overgrowth, as discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some oral feeding is important in infants in order to avoid feeding aversion.

It has the optimal macronutrient composition for human growth, as well as tropic factors which may foster intestinal adaptation, and immunoglobulins and other immune factors that may enhance mucosal barrier function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/42,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,46-48</a>]. In addition, breast milk is relatively hypoallergenic, but has the advantage of a lower osmotic load compared with a typical &quot;hypoallergenic&quot; formula (ie, extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formula). Breast milk may also reduce the risk of developing IFALD, through an unclear mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If breast milk becomes unavailable or is not well-tolerated, use of an amino acid-based (&quot;elemental&quot;) formula is appropriate. Amino acid-based formulas are preferable to standard cow's milk- or soy-based infant formulas because infants with SBS may more easily absorb nutrients that are broken down. The hypoallergenic nature of these formulas also may be beneficial, because children with SBS may be at increased risk for protein allergy or intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children#H2520804390\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Allergic and eosinophilic disease'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, initial enteral feeding in the SBS infant should be given as breastmilk. If breastmilk is not available or is poorly tolerated, we change to an amino-acid based formula, which is typically continued throughout infancy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Older children</strong> &ndash; If SBS first develops during childhood or adolescence, an intact protein or blenderized real food formula (eg, Pediatric Compleat, BoostKids Essentials, or PediaSure) may be trialed for initial enteral feeding, because protein intolerance is less common in this age group compared with infants. Moreover, the complex nutrients that are found in intact protein formulas may be helpful in stimulating intestinal adaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For individuals who had SBS during infancy and were fed with breastmilk or an amino acid-based formula, it may be possible to transition to an intact protein formula or blenderized food formula sometime during the second year of life. This decision is patient specific, and a transition is often prompted by the child beginning to take increasing amounts of intact protein by mouth in the form of table foods. In some cases we transition to a partially hydrolyzed formula rather than intact proteins. The approach to transitioning should be gradual, and some patients continue to require an amino acid-based formula. Indications for resuming an amino acid-based formula include increased diarrhea, increased emesis or decreased rate of weight gain following change to intact protein formula. </p><p/><p>For patients with SBS of all ages, enteral feeding is initiated as a continuous infusion via a nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding tube. Continuous enteral feeding maximizes tolerance in the setting of limited gut functional capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. It also permits constant saturation of carrier transport proteins, taking full advantage of the absorptive surface area available and enhancing adaptation, which is greatest in the first few months after resection. Some patients, such as those with poor gastric emptying or intestinal dysmotility, may benefit from post-pyloric feeding using a gastrojejunal (GJ) tube. </p><p>Regardless of the severity of SBS, it is imperative to provide small oral feedings at age-appropriate intervals, to allow for development of suck and swallow reflex and to prevent oral aversion, even if only small volumes are tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H11453706\" class=\"local\">'Oral feeding'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190737431\"><span class=\"h2\">Protocol for feeding advancement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteral feedings should be advanced slowly, with reciprocal decreases in PN calculated to maintain nutritional status and compensate for fluid losses. The rate at which feeds can be advanced depends upon the amount of remaining intestine, the patient's size and age, and the patient's total absorptive capacity. In most patients there is gradual improvement in absorptive capacity for at least two years after intestinal resection, because of intestinal adaptation. Infants can show signs of intestinal adaptation for several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Because not all enteral calories provided will be absorbed, PN should not be decreased isocalorically as enteral feeds are advanced. The most successful approach is to make frequent small increases in enteral feeds as tolerated, with ongoing assessment of growth parameters to determine when PN can safely be reduced. (See <a href=\"#H32888166\" class=\"local\">'Growth goals'</a> above.)</p><p>We recommend using a protocol with specific criteria to guide feeding advancement, because this encourages steady progress. For infants, our institutional practice is to initiate feeds early with breast milk or amino acid-based formula, and to increase enteral feeding volume by 10 mL per kilogram of body weight per day, as permitted based on stool or ostomy output. This protocol is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108756\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108756 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107910 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>The protocol assumes that the following criteria represent a threshold for enteral tolerance: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteral fluid loss &ndash; 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> of ostomy output, or 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> of stool output are used as the primary indicator that the threshold of enteral tolerance has been reached.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing substances &ndash; 1 percent in stool or ostomy output may be used as a secondary indicator that the threshold of enteral tolerance has been reached. </p><p/><p>Enteral fluid losses less than these thresholds warrant continued modest advancement in the rate of enteral feeds. Values above this threshold indicates that enteral tolerance has been exceeded and warrants interruption of the enteral feeds <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a modest reduction in the feeding rate. However, it should be recognized that these thresholds are approximate, and that a faster or slower pace of feeding advancement may be appropriate for an individual patient. The benefits of a similar feeding advancement protocol was shown in a series from a large NICU, in which meaningful advances in enteral feeds were achieved more rapidly when specific advancement criteria were used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>Stool alpha-1-antitrypsin, fecal elastase, and spot tests for fecal fat should generally not be used to judge enteral feeding tolerance as they are frequently abnormal in SBS even when the child is otherwise tolerating enteral feeds. However, these tests may be helpful to guide decision making about clinical monitoring and formula selection. For example, a patient with evidence of steatorrhea may benefit from a medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)-enriched formula, and is also at increased risk for developing fat soluble vitamin deficiencies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1181785328\"><span class=\"h2\">Converting to bolus feeds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As tolerance improves, continuous feedings may eventually be either partially or completely replaced by intermittent bolus feedings. A common approach is to initiate bolus feeds when a patient is receiving at least half of his or her total energy requirements from enteral feeds, with the remainder being from PN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. For convenience, patients may receive continuous enteral feeds at night and bolus feedings during the day. Generally, small frequent bolus or oral feedings are better tolerated than infrequent large feedings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1236357414\"><span class=\"h2\">Weaning parenteral nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As enteral feedings are advanced, PN can be gradually reduced. The volume and composition of PN infused should be adjusted frequently, to ensure appropriate intake of fluids and electrolytes. Decisions about the amount of energy (calories) provided in the PN should be guided primarily by weight gain rather than by calculations of total caloric input, because individuals with SBS will almost always malabsorb a portion of their enteral caloric intake, and thus will require more calories when fed exclusively by the enteral route. The amount of supplemental PN provided must be individualized with the goal of providing the minimum amount of PN required to sustain a normal growth pattern and body composition. </p><p>Indications for continued parenteral nutrition (PN) include poor weight gain or fluid and electrolyte losses that are too extensive to be replaced enterally. In some patients, feeding tolerance may continue to improve over several years as intestinal adaptation progresses, ultimately allowing a more gradual conversion to a full enteral diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Some children with borderline enteral function can be maintained with a regimen of PN fewer than seven nights per week. It is important to note that these patients might be at increased risk for vitamin and micronutrient deficiency and thus those patients receiving fewer than seven nights per week of PN should also receive a daily enteral vitamin supplement (see <a href=\"#H11453713\" class=\"local\">'Malabsorption of fat and vitamins'</a> below). A reasonable approach is to focus first on weaning PN and then on weaning IV fluid support. Some patients are eventually able to wean from PN but continue to need parenteral fluids to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, which are typically administered at night, for convenience. Many children may require significant increases in parenteral nutrition during puberty to support this phase of rapid growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children#H135425541\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;, section on 'How to prescribe PN'</a>.)</p><p>PN &quot;cycling&quot; refers to the technique of administering the same total volume of PN solution at a higher rate for fewer than 24 hours, thereby providing a period of time each day without PN infusion. This approach is valuable as patients become older and better able to tolerate enteral nutrition. It provides the patient with greater freedom, helps to promote an interest in oral feeds, and may reduce the hepatotoxic effects of the PN (intestinal failure-associated liver disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. PN cycling requires careful planning and monitoring, to avoid hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. The technique and monitoring is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children#H20519158\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Cycling'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional considerations for diet composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with specific nutritional challenges or who are not making progress in advancing feeds, additional adjustments to the macronutrient content of the diet may be helpful. These considerations are also relevant for toddlers or older children who are transitioning from enteral feeds to an oral diet. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fats</strong> &ndash; Infants and young children with SBS generally benefit from an enteral diet that is relatively high in fat, in which fat comprises 40 to 50 percent of total enteral energy intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Breast milk and standard infant formulas have fat contents within this range. Dietary fat has the benefit of a relatively low osmotic load and a high energy content. Enteral fat may also promote intestinal adaptation and improve enteral tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H27027264\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Nutrient effects'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) are useful in the management of SBS. LCTs may be helpful in stimulating bowel adaptation, and MCTs may be better absorbed since they directly cross the enterocyte membrane and thus bypass the need for lymphatic absorption. A ratio of 40 percent MCTs and 60 percent LCTs has been suggested for patients with SBS; however, the proportion should be adjusted based on the individual patient's response to different feeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-short-bowel-syndrome#H27027264\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of short bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Nutrient effects'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We do not routinely recommend the addition of supplemental fat to enteral formula; however, we do encourage an oral diet that is high in fat if tolerated. Strategies to incorporate more fat into the oral diet include using additional oil and butter while cooking. In our experience we have found a subset of patients with biochemical essential fatty acid deficiency (as defined by a triene:tetraene ratio &gt;0.05), which develops during or shortly after weaning from PN. We manage these patients by supplementing their diet with canola, walnut or flaxseed oils, with ongoing monitoring of essential fatty acid levels and growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children#H63093221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Common deficiencies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carbohydrates</strong> &ndash; Most infants with SBS, especially those without a colon, do not tolerate high concentrations of carbohydrates. This is because carbohydrates tend to have an increased osmotic load in comparison to fats and intact proteins. Complex carbohydrates have a lower osmotic load than simple carbohydrates (sugars), and therefore may be better tolerated. For infants on formula feeds, the strategies to manage carbohydrate intolerance include slow advancement of feeds and selection of formula with a higher fat content. For older patients, strategies include selection of formulas or solid foods with starches or other complex carbohydrates (eg, blenderized formulas) rather than high amounts of simple sugars. However, the individual patient's anatomy and response to feeding should guide any dietary restrictions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lactose should not be automatically restricted in patients with SBS. Dairy products are a good source of fat, energy and calcium, all of which are quite beneficial. Cheese or yogurt may be better tolerated than milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Therefore, it is typical to introduce yogurt or cheese initially and then broaden the diet to include milk if the patient shows no signs intolerance or allergy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fiber</strong> &ndash; For selected patients, soluble fibers such as pectin or guar-gum may be mixed with formula to provide 1 g of fiber per 100 mL, and then advanced to a maximum of 3 percent of total feeding volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Candidates for fiber supplements are older infants or children with watery diarrhea that is problematic and does not respond to carbohydrate restriction, and who have an intact colon and no history or risk factors for bacterial overgrowth. The risks of using fiber in SBS may be substantial and it should therefore be employed only in patients who would likely benefit based on residual anatomy, and with ongoing assessment of therapeutic response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential benefits of soluble fiber are that it can slow gastrointestinal transit and enhance adaptation of the colonic mucosa, by promoting the colonic production of short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, which can in turn serve as an energy source for colonocytes. For patients with enterostomies, the benefit of fiber is limited to local bulking of stool consistency. This effect may also be helpful in patients with perineal skin breakdown related to watery diarrhea. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential risks of soluble fiber are that it reduces bioavailability of calcium, zinc and other divalent cations, and may exacerbate small bowel bacterial overgrowth through its role as a prebiotic. Reports of gastrointestinal obstruction following high-dose pectin supplementation have also been reported, so it is important to adhere to recommended dosing protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Insoluble fibers, such as wheat bran and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">psyllium</a>, may lead to slight improvement in symptoms by thickening the stool but are not thought to have an effect on intestinal adaptation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oxalate</strong> &ndash; Children with SBS who have developed calcium oxalate renal stones or symptomatic D-lactic acidosis should be placed on a low oxalate diet. Typically this is achieved through avoidance of table foods that are high in oxalate versus by changing the type of enteral formula. Hyperoxaluria in patients with SBS is caused by fat malabsorption, which leads to binding of free calcium acids in the intestinal lumen, which in turn reduces calcium binding to oxalate. Furthermore, in patients with a history of D-lactic acidosis (a sequela of certain types of small bowel bacterial overgrowth), a low oxalate diet may be indicated to avoid inhibition of the D2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase (D-2HDH) enzyme, and thus promote adequate metabolism of D-lactic acid to prevent this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Foods high in oxalate include rhubarb, spinach, beets, potatoes, and cocoa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Feeding aversion is common if oral feeds are not provided at the developmentally appropriate times, and can become a chronic problem. Thus, infants should be fed breast milk or formula by mouth, and transitioned to solids at an age-appropriate time; even if only small amounts of feeds can be given by this route because of the SBS. </p><p>Recommendations for most infants, based on expert opinion and experience, are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/56,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,69</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Introduce small oral feeds of breast milk (or formula, when necessary) during the neonatal period, or as soon as enteral feeds are tolerated. A common initial approach is to give an oral feed two to three times per day, replacing one hour of the infant's continuous enteral feedings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Introduce solid foods at an appropriate age (eg, between four and six months corrected gestational age), provided that there is no evidence of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. At our center, we typically start with rice cereal or a stage I fruit or vegetable baby food. Some other centers start by introducing a pureed meat, due to the high protein and fat content and the relatively low carbohydrate load. Regardless of the food, it is important to be vigilant for signs of poor tolerance (such as increased gastrointestinal output) or allergy (such as rash or bloody stools). Families should be counseled to introduce only one new food per week to allow for accurate assessment of tolerance. Some data suggest that children with SBS have impaired intestinal barrier function as well as absorptive function, leading them to be at higher risk of food allergies. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1807045411\"><span class=\"h3\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who successfully wean from PN are often able to gradually transition from tube feeding to oral feeding, and may eventually achieve a fairly normal diet. These children tend to tolerate fats better than carbohydrates, and complex carbohydrates better than simple sugars. Hyperphagia is a typical and expected response as a means of overcoming malabsorption. However, incorrect choices of oral foods may lead to higher gastrointestinal outputs and regression of enteral autonomy. Routine counseling with a dietician is helpful to mitigate this risk. </p><p>Especially after achieving an ad libitum oral diet, children with SBS may experience fat malabsorption. This finding does not typically warrant a reduction in the intake of dietary fat, because the caloric density of fat is twice that of protein, and thus it provides significant energy even if partially malabsorbed. </p><p>The important elements of chronic enteral nutrition are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diet that is a reasonably balanced mixture of fats, protein, and carbohydrates. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of hypertonic beverages (eg, sodas and fruit juices), and simple carbohydrates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Introduction of oral feeding age appropriate intervals to promote suck and swallow reflex and to prevent oral aversion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring and replacement therapy for micronutrient deficiencies.

The risk factors and clinical manifestations of these deficiencies are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Resection of the terminal ileum confers an increased risk of both fat soluble vitamin deficiency and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin B12</a> deficiency. The risk of vitamin B12 deficiency may also be exacerbated by acid suppression as this impedes the secretion of intrinsic factor necessary for B12 absorption in the terminal ileum. Micronutrient deficiencies may occur even if the total energy absorption and somatic growth are adequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. </p><p>The risk of nutrient deficiency is greatest after discontinuation of PN because the degree of intestinal adaptation and the absorption of nutrients are unpredictable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. However, patients on full PN support also may have deficiencies and should be monitored.

Elevations in serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) may be used as a sensitive marker of B12 status. MMA may be elevated in the setting of small bowel bacterial overgrowth even in the absence of B12 deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

If the child has had resection of the terminal ileum, first-line treatment for treating this deficiency is initiation of monthly intramuscular (IM) cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) injections. In our experience, a dose of 500 micrograms monthly has been effective in children &le;10 years of age and 1000 micrograms monthly has been effective in children &gt;10 years of age.

These centers focus on optimizing enteral feeding and weaning from parenteral nutrition (PN), with judicious use of pharmacotherapy and surgical interventions. This approach is associated with improved survival and achievement of independence from PN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/23,109,110,123,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,109,110,123,124</a>]. Clinical guidelines from the American Society of Enteral and Parenteral Nutrition (ASPEN) suggest that for patients managed by multidisciplinary teams the &quot;improvement in survival is compelling,&quot; although there is only &quot;weak evidence&quot; that outcomes from intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD) are improved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SMALL BOWEL TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for small <span class=\"nowrap\">bowel/multivisceral</span> transplantation in patients with SBS has decreased as outcomes from medical and surgical management have improved. One report noted a 25 percent decline in the number of intestinal transplantations occurring in the United States between 2006 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. Selected children with SBS are transplantation candidates; these include patients with progressive and severe intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD), loss of venous access, or recurrent life-threatening central venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections. Additional indications include complete mesenteric thrombosis, slow growing tumors of the hepatic hilum or root of mesentery, or extremely short residual bowel (ie, little to no chance of achieving enteral autonomy) in a patient who prefers transplantation to lifelong parenteral nutrition dependence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-and-multivisceral-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal and multivisceral transplantation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of short bowel syndrome (SBS) requires a stepwise approach to maintain good nutrition and minimize complications due to malabsorption and intestinal failure-associated liver disease (also known as parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary factors that influence the likelihood that a patient with SBS will ultimately be able to wean from parenteral nutrition (PN) are the length of remaining small bowel, which segments of the bowel remain, and the process of intestinal adaptation. Intestinal adaptation occurs gradually, and depends in large part on exposure of the intestine to enteral feeds. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Likelihood of weaning from PN'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early management of SBS primarily involves close monitoring of stool output, and replacement of these fluid and electrolyte losses. PN is used for nutritional support. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Early management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteral feeding should begin promptly once the patient stabilizes after intestinal resection surgery; a protocol for initiating and advancing feeds is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108756\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108756 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107910 \">table 1</a>). Continuous enteral feeding or small frequent feedings are preferred initially. For infants, breast milk or amino acid-based formulas are preferred. The absorptive state and feeding tolerance are reassessed frequently as adaptation progresses, mostly based on changes in stool output, and the composition and rate of enteral feeds is adjusted accordingly. The overall goal is to maximize the proportion of nutrition given via the enteral route, as tolerated. (See <a href=\"#H236217344\" class=\"local\">'Initiating feeds'</a> above and <a href=\"#H190737431\" class=\"local\">'Protocol for feeding advancement'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with SBS are at substantial risk for nutritional deficiencies, particularly while PN is being tapered and after it is discontinued. The most common deficiencies are of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), calcium, iron, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin B12</a>. Our practice is to initiate an enteral vitamin supplement when PN has been weaned to fewer than seven days per week, using a water-miscible form of vitamins A, D, E, and K. We perform routine laboratory testing for vitamin and mineral deficiencies before and after weaning from PN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F108641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108641 \">table 2</a>), and provide additional supplements as needed. (See <a href=\"#H3038755869\" class=\"local\">'Nutrient deficiencies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several medications have been tested in an effort to enhance intestinal adaptation and improve feeding tolerance:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend administering acid-suppressing medications (H2 blockers and PPIs) to patients with SBS during the first three to six months after intestinal resection, to reduce gastric secretion and enteral fluid losses (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H842897327\" class=\"local\">'Acid suppression'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1887329\" class=\"local\">'Antisecretory agents'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Loperamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cholestyramine</a> are often useful to maximize enteral tolerance in select SBS patients. Other medications are occasionally used to promote motility or stimulate appetite, based on limited evidence. Patient selection and other considerations are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=teduglutide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Teduglutide</a>, an analog of glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), has modest benefits in promoting intestinal adaptation in SBS, and this agent has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in adults with SBS. (See <a href=\"#H2573155439\" class=\"local\">'Adaptive agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with dilated bowel who are not making significant progress towards weaning from PN despite maximal medical and nutritional therapy, an intestinal tailoring <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lengthening procedure may be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H841534\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal tailoring and lengthening procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multidisciplinary management of SBS patients has led to improved survival, higher rates of weaning from PN, and other important outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H15788461\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal rehabilitation programs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A transplantation procedure is appropriate for selected individuals with life-threatening complications of SBS. Because of the success of multidisciplinary intestinal rehabilitation programs, the need for intestinal transplantation for SBS has diminished substantially.
