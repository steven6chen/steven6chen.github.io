If a woman is going to be away from her baby when it is time to breastfeed, she can instead pump milk from her breasts using a pump. The breast milk can be collected, stored, and fed to her baby later. </p><p>Pumping also helps the breasts make more milk. A woman can use a breast pump when she wants to breastfeed but can't because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Her baby needs to stay in the hospital after birth because it was born too early or is sick</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She can't be with her baby all the time because of work, travel, or other reasons</p><p/><p>Some women choose to pump because they have trouble breastfeeding, but still want their baby to get the benefits of breast milk. Some women pump so their partner can be more involved with feeding the baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044667\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there different types of breast pumps?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The right breast pump for you will depend on why you need it and how often you plan to use it.</p><p>The different types of breast pumps include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electric pumps that are used in hospitals &ndash; These breast pumps are powerful and collect breast milk the fastest. They are often used by women whose babies need to stay in the hospital after birth. Women can also rent these types of pumps to use at home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal electric pumps &ndash; These breast pumps are smaller than hospital electric pumps. They can collect breast milk fast, but usually not as fast as hospital pumps. Personal pumps can come in a carrying case. They can be good for women who pump at work.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single-sided pumps &ndash; These breast pumps collect milk slower than hospital and personal electric pumps. They can be powered by hand, batteries, or electricity. They can be good for women who need to pump breast milk only once in a while.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044674\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I use a breast pump?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each breast pump will have its own directions. But for all breast pumps, it's important to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands with soap and water before pumping. You do not have to wash your breasts or nipples.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure the pump pieces and the containers for storing breast milk are clean.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure the cone-shaped pieces that fit over the breasts are the right size. These pieces are called &quot;flanges.&quot; Your nipple should not rub against the tunnel part of the flange (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F109992\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109992 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Before a breast pump can collect your breast milk, your breasts need to &quot;let down&quot; the milk. Let-down is when the milk flows from the milk glands into the milk ducts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72583\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72583 \">figure 2</a>). Usually, let-down happens soon after you start pumping. But if it doesn't, you can try the following things:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massage your breasts gently before you pump</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a warm wet cloth on your breasts before you pump</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pump in a dark and quiet room</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Look at a picture of your baby when you start pumping</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044681\"><span class=\"h1\">How should I store pumped breast milk?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can store pumped breast milk in different places and for different amounts of time. Breast milk can be stored:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At room temperature for up to 4 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the refrigerator for up to 3 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the freezer for up to 9 months </p><p/><p>You can store breast milk in clean glass or plastic bottles, or in plastic bags. It can be helpful to store breast milk in small amounts. You should also write the date that the milk was pumped on the container. That way, you can use the oldest milk first. Some hospitals have different rules for storing breast milk. If your baby is in the hospital, check with the doctor or nurse. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044688\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I warm up stored breast milk?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Make sure to warm up breast milk from the freezer or refrigerator slowly. Do not thaw or warm up breast milk by putting it in the microwave. Instead, fill a small pot or container with warm water and put the bottle in it. Do not let the whole bottle go under water.</p><p>Be sure to test the temperature of the milk before you feed it to your baby. The milk should be a little bit warm or at room temperature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044695\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I pump at work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Talk with the people you work with about when and where you can pump. By law, your work needs to give you breaks so that you can pump. Your work also needs to give you a private place where you can pump.</p><p>Pumping at work can be time consuming and sometimes stressful. It might help to talk to friends or coworkers who have done this before. It can also help to remember that you are giving your baby all the health benefits of breast milk, even when you can't breastfeed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044702\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have questions?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have any questions about breast pumps, ask your doctor or nurse. Some women also find it helpful to work with a breastfeeding expert called a &quot;lactation consultant.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044814\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breastfeeding (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breastfeeding-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common breastfeeding problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-and-nutrition-for-women-who-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Health and nutrition for women who breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weaning from breastfeeding (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-guide-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breastfeeding guide (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pumping-breast-milk-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pumping breast milk (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
