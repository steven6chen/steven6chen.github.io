In the United States, there will be an estimated 161,000 cases and 26,700 deaths in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The clinical behavior of prostate cancer ranges from a microscopic, well-differentiated tumor that may never be clinically significant to an aggressive, high-grade cancer that ultimately causes metastases, morbidity, and death.</p><p>The frequency of diagnosis of prostate cancer had been increasing for many years due largely to the widespread use of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Following the introduction of PSA testing, the incidence of prostate cancer peaked in 1992, declined between 1992 and 1995, and had risen since then at a rate of approximately 1 percent per year until recently. The reasons for this increasing incidence were not known; both genetic and environmental factors have been implicated. The incidence is higher in blacks than in whites in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62493\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62493 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>In 2008, the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against screening for men over the age of 75, giving it a D recommendation. In 2012, the USPSTF recommended against screening for all men, giving it a D recommendation. The recommendation of the USPSTF was based partly on the concern that the benefit of diagnosing and treating prostate cancer may not outweigh the risks of treatment, especially considering that many men would be treated for a cancer not likely to cause them harm. There is still considerable controversy, and many men continue to be screened for prostate cancer, although the rate of screening and diagnosis of prostate cancer has declined in all age groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for prostate cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>An overview of the clinical presentation and initial diagnosis of men with prostate cancer is presented here.

However, digital rectal examination retains an important role for early detection as 20 percent of cases have a prostate abnormality that prompts the biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74636032\"><span class=\"h2\">PSA screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein made solely by prostate cells so the antigen is highly specific for the prostate. However, it is not prostate cancer specific, and other prostate conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostatitis, can affect PSA levels. The lack of specificity for prostate cancer has led to considerable controversy about the role of routine PSA testing. The controversy is compounded by the knowledge that not all cancers detected by routine screening require treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-prostate-specific-antigen#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of prostate-specific antigen&quot;, section on 'Causes of an elevated serum PSA'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)'</a>.)</p><p>The fact that PSA screening detects more cancers is not debated. The incidence of a prostate cancer diagnosis increased substantially after the advent of PSA testing in the late 1980's. Originally, reference ranges were established as cut points for a &quot;normal&quot; PSA. More recent knowledge shows that PSA levels correlate with a continuum of increasing risk, with no level below which a man can be declared to not have prostate cancer, nor is there a level above which the PSA level definitively indicates prostate cancer.</p><p>Multiple methods are used to increase the accuracy of PSA testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age related reference range &ndash; PSA levels generally increase as men age so that a single value must be benchmarked against the norm for a specific age group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PSA density &ndash; As the size of the prostate increases, the amount of PSA produced by benign prostate cells may increase correspondingly. PSA density calculates the ratio of prostate size to PSA. Digital rectal examination is inaccurate in determining prostate volume, although there is some merit in the understanding that a large prostate size on examination may be associated with a higher PSA. Accurate calculation of PSA density depends upon measurement of prostate volume on ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractionated PSA &ndash; PSA can be measured in two serum components, either conjugated or free. The percentage of free PSA relative to the total PSA can be informative, as a high ratio (&gt;30 percent) is considered favorable, while a low ratio (&lt;10 percent) is more commonly associated with prostate cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCa3) measurement is obtained on a urine specimen collected after a digital rectal examination and prostatic massage. This test can provide supplementary information to the PSA level in some clinical situations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer#H988952102\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'PCA3'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PSA velocity &ndash; Changes in PSA over time, sometimes termed PSA velocity, can be highly informative. Although some increase with age is expected, a substantial change is worrisome. A change of &gt;0.35 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> may prompt a biopsy if the PSA value is between 2.5 and 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> while a greater than 0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> change within a year may prompt investigation with a PSA over 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genomic testing &ndash; Several tests are sometimes used to evaluate a panel of genetic changes of known prostate cancers to help determine prognosis, but none are yet useful to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-prognostic-tests-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular prognostic tests for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Generally, PSA should be repeated before a biopsy is recommended since almost a third of patients will have a decrease to baseline levels if PSA is repeated a month or so later. Giving antibiotics to asymptomatic men with no evidence of a urinary tract infection or prostatitis is not helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H638867441\"><span class=\"h3\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Considerable controversy remains about PSA screening. Although more cancers are found through PSA screening, many men undergo a biopsy, which may prove to be negative, or are subjected to treatment and its side effects for a cancer that may not be life threatening. Targeting screening to the most optimal population (those with at least 10 years of life expectancy, those with a family history of prostate cancer, and blacks) and a straightforward discussion of the merits of treatment for a cancer that is detected temper some of the concerns surrounding PSA screening.</p><p>The issues surrounding PSA screening for prostate cancer are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74636051\"><span class=\"h2\">Digital rectal examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On digital rectal examination, asymmetric areas of induration or frank nodules are suggestive of prostate cancer. In contrast, symmetric enlargement and firmness of the prostate are more frequent in men with BPH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A prostate biopsy is indicated in men with a digital rectal examination that is suspicious for cancer, regardless of the serum PSA. All men with significant asymmetry, induration, or palpable nodularity of the prostate gland require further diagnostic studies to rule out prostate cancer, particularly if they are over the age of 45 or have other risk factors for the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Digital rectal examination can detect tumors in the posterior and lateral aspects of the prostate gland. Tumors not detected by digital rectal examination include the 25 to 35 percent that occur in other parts of the gland and small, stage T1 cancers that are not palpable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110728\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110728 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-staging-and-evaluation-of-men-with-newly-diagnosed-prostate-cancer#H686719702\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial staging and evaluation of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Staging system'</a>.)</p><p>Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) is often used to evaluate abnormalities detected by digital rectal examination and to guide sites for prostate biopsy. However, prostate biopsy is recommended regardless of the results since TRUS misses a substantial number of tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Cancers typically appear hypoechoic, but some may be hyperechoic or isoechoic, leading to false negative studies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74636058\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most men with early stage prostate cancer have no symptoms attributable to the cancer. </p><p>Urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, and hesitancy are seen commonly but are usually related to a concomitant benign prostate enlargement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hematuria and hematospermia are uncommon presentations of prostate cancer, but their presence in older men should prompt consideration of prostate cancer in the differential diagnosis. These symptoms are also present in men with BPH and are more likely to be caused by BPH than cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bone pain may be the presenting symptom in men with metastatic disease, but an initial diagnosis when bone metastases are present has become unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-metastases-in-advanced-prostate-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H19253279\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone metastases in advanced prostate cancer: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-staging-and-evaluation-of-men-with-newly-diagnosed-prostate-cancer#H686719814\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial staging and evaluation of men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for distant metastases'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men with abnormal prostate exams (nodules, induration, or asymmetry) should be referred to a urologist for a prostate biopsy, with the histologic diagnosis based upon tissue obtained from the biopsy. A prostate biopsy may also be indicated based upon abnormal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Referrals to urology to evaluate abnormal results'</a>.)</p><p>A transrectal biopsy typically is performed with transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance. TRUS may image prostate cancer as a hypoechoic area, but the test is used to direct prostate biopsy rather than as a diagnostic modality. A transperineal route may also be used for biopsy. This approach may require general anesthesia or, at least, sedation, but it is also associated with a lower risk of infection.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted prostate biopsy is being evaluated as a method to improve the accuracy of TRUS biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Clinical settings in which this approach may have utility include patients with a rising PSA and a prior negative biopsy, and those men with prostate cancer who will be managed with active surveillance. MRI-guided biopsy may also have a role when patients are being considered for salvage prostatectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-biopsy#H119732198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate biopsy&quot;, section on 'MR-targeted biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>If a biopsy is to be performed based upon the finding of an elevated serum PSA, confirmation of the elevated serum PSA is advisable prior to proceeding to prostate biopsy. The measurement of serum PSA is also important for prognostic purposes. Although serum PSA concentrations may rise slightly during the first several hours after a rectal examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-prostate-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], the rise is small enough that the blood sample for PSA testing can be obtained at any time prior to biopsy. </p><p>The technique involved in prostate biopsy, including preparation, complications, and extent of sampling (a minimum of 12 cores in most situations), are discussed separately, as is pathologic interpretation of the prostate biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate biopsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpretation-of-prostate-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpretation of prostate biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A negative biopsy does not exclude the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Biopsy is a sampling technique with a substantial potential for misdiagnosis. Repeat biopsy may be indicated if the PSA level increases further. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-biopsy#H2924776\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prostate biopsy&quot;, section on 'Need for repeat biopsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
