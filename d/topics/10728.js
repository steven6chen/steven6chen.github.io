It is a typical Mendelian disorder. It is associated with hypoxia-induced polymerization of the abnormal HbS molecule, followed by red blood cell injury and sickling, with resultant microvascular occlusion (vaso-occlusion) clinically manifested most often as an acute painful episode or &quot;crisis&quot; but with many other acute and chronic complications.</p><p>However, numerous features of SCD are not accounted for by polymerization-based explanations alone, including the high degree of clinical heterogeneity among patients with identical hemoglobin genotypes, the unpredictable occurrence of acute vaso-occlusive episodes, the variable rate of hemolysis among patients, and the different frequencies of the many chronic complications. This variance in phenotypic expression is due partly to the modulating effects of modifier genes such as those that control fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression or cause alpha thalassemia. Other less well-documented disease modifying genes, and environmental and psychosocial factors are also important contributors. Recognition of these polymerization-independent mechanisms has placed the sickle cell disorders into the broader area of vascular disease, in which the interaction between sickle cells and the vascular endothelium assumes pathogenetic importance. Interrupting such interactions may provide a worthwhile therapeutic strategy.

The attribution of all aspects of SCD to hemoglobin polymerization-related events evolved to a great extent from circumstantial evidence linking the peculiar shape of sickle red cells, abnormal HbS solubility, blood viscosity, structure of the HbS polymer, and impaired rheological properties of sickle cell suspensions. The relationships among these abnormalities is complex and not totally reflective of the clinical realities of the disease.

Furthermore, as additional support for the importance of polymerization, therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> induces increased levels of HbF that reduce HbS polymerization and decrease the frequencies of pain, acute chest syndrome, and transfusion in children and adults with SCD.</p><p>Clinical examples providing the best evidence for polymerization-induced sickling as the initiating cause of vaso-occlusion are the two sickle cell disorders HbSC disease and HbS with gene deletion hereditary persistence of HbF (HbS-HPFH):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The marked cellular dehydration seen in HbSC red cells results in increased intraerythrocytic concentrations of HbS which support polymerization, causing symptoms of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The virtual absence of vaso-occlusive complications in HbS-HPFH is due to pancellular high levels of HbF, inhibiting polymerization and cellular sickling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

Patients with SCD do not experience systematic fluctuations in conditions that enhance hemoglobin polymerization and sickling (eg, hypoxemia, acidosis). Indeed, there is a lack of evidence for increased pain crises in subjects with concomitant sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], a condition associated with periodic hypoxemia.</p><p>Further evidence against episodes of acute cell sickling accounting for vaso-occlusive episodes derives from consideration that the average adult has a blood volume of approximately five liters and a cardiac output of five <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min,</span> which dictates that the average red cell must be exposed to hypoxic conditions on the venous side of the circulation approximately once per minute. Thus, the process of cell sickling must be incessant, as suggested by the presence in the blood of sickled cells at all times, even in the absence of an acute vaso-occlusive event, and not dependent on accelerated HbS polymerization to initiate a bout of vaso-occlusion. Despite well-defined conditions in which vaso-occlusion appears to be associated directly to cell sickling, such as acute hypoxia and hypertonicity, in most circumstances acute vaso-occlusive events are not triggered by sudden HbS polymerization, although the nature of the events triggering acute painful episodes is usually unknown.</p><p>Therefore, HbS polymerization provides a first approximation of clinical severity, and additional factors are likely to determine the temporal and interpatient variability so characteristic of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. It has therefore been concluded that the onset of acute cell sickling is neither a necessary and sufficient condition nor the primary initiator of the common painful episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Microvascular obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A second controversial issue has to do with the assumption that the pathophysiology of SCD involves microvascular obstruction. This is based on the expectation that the smallest vessels should be most susceptible to occlusion. However, studies of animal models and human subjects have identified several sites of impaired blood flow and vaso-occlusion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rat mesocecum capillaries perfused with human sickle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small vessels of autopsy and biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Capillaries of the nail bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and forearm skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large arteries of sickle cell patients with stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arteriolar-capillary bifurcations and venular junctions in microvascular flow models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-capillary venules of rat mesocecums perfused with human sickle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and of mucosal-intestinal tissues of transgenic knockout sickle cell mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]</p><p/><p>Thus, there are numerous sites of initiation of vaso-occlusion. It seems reasonable to suggest that the initiation of vaso-occlusion varies over time and place according to differences in blood shear rates and endothelial activation states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], vascular bed characteristics, vascular tone, differential responses to endothelial cell agonists, and varying utilization of cellular and soluble adhesion molecules. These subjects are discussed in greater detail below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Multiple pathway model'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">The 'steady state'</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A third issue with the concept of polymerization-based pathophysiology pertains to whether episodes of acute vaso-occlusion are a perturbation of &quot;steady-state&quot; blood flow. Clinical observation suggests a baseline state or &quot;steady state,&quot; in which patients with SCD are clinically asymptomatic until some event triggers an episode of acute vaso-occlusion. In the &quot;steady state,&quot; a lack of overt clinical events, however, cannot be equated with the abeyance of sickle vasculopathy as the hemolytic anemia and vasculopathy of this disease continue even in the absence of clinically apparent acute vaso-occlusive events. Many studies have shown that patients who have the most severe anemia have fewer acute vaso-occlusive events yet have shorter survival and more chronic organ damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Extensive biochemical data have blurred the distinction between a so-called &quot;steady state&quot; and acute vaso-occlusion in SCD. Several biochemical markers are elevated in the blood of patients with SCD who have not had a recent acute painful episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. The list of such markers found to be elevated in patients with SCD is extensive, and includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C-reactive protein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrinogen and other acute phase reactants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, and IL-2 receptor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interferon-gamma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Markers of activity of the endothelial cell agonist, thrombin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endotoxin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circulating endothelial cells</p><p/><p>Abnormal levels of activators of endothelial cells, macrophages, and other blood cells have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], and it has been suggested that levels of cytokines and other cell agonists may be used as a measure of clinical severity in SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>While fluctuating levels of inflammatory markers during &quot;steady state&quot; may be indicative of subclinical vaso-occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], it is uncertain whether these fluctuations are of pathophysiologic importance. Indeed, there may be little difference between the physiologic conditions existing during &quot;steady state&quot; and the acute vaso-occlusive episode. Initiation of an acute painful event could simply reflect a slight imbalance in circulatory homeostasis, derived from a mere stochastic accumulation of input from several physiologic mechanisms, a phenomenon that has been referred to as &quot;stochastic stasis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Considering the remarkable number of potentially relevant mechanisms that have been identified with vaso-occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74933\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74933 \">table 1</a>), it seems unreasonable to postulate only one pathophysiologic mechanism. Rather, it is plausible that mechanisms underlying vaso-occlusion vary with time and anatomic site, and also vary among patients. Certainly there are relevant differences among distinct vascular beds, as shown by the functional heterogeneity of endothelial cells from large and small vessel sources and by organ to organ differences in the microvasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-endothelium-a-primer#H1854496\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The endothelium: A primer&quot;, section on 'Endothelial heterogeneity'</a>.)</p><p>The high prevalence of retinopathy in patients with HbSC disease and osteonecrosis in those with sickle cell anemia and coexisting alpha thalassemia, might be a result of the enhanced circulatory competence of sickle erythrocytes in these genotypes that lead to a higher packed cell volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Vaso-occlusive mechanisms could differ according to the organ complication under study, for example the special circulatory system of the spleen, and data obtained during acute painful episodes may not reflect the same mechanisms as vaso-occlusion in other organs.

The absence of hemolytic anemia and sickle vaso-occlusion in individuals who co-inherit a form of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) (see <a href=\"#H3855048688\" class=\"local\">'Hemoglobin polymerization'</a> above), where each erythrocyte has sufficient HbF to inhibit polymer formation but also contains 70 percent HbS, provides a compelling example of the clinical importance of HbS polymer (and the therapeutic utility of achieving high HbF in almost all sickle cells).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Red blood cells</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Microvascular transit time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The belief that vaso-occlusive events are caused by sudden episodes of cellular deoxygenation and sickling does not reconcile with the knowledge that under normal conditions the average red blood cell is deoxygenated at least once a minute. With the passage from the arterial to the venous circulation, substantial numbers of cells become grossly sickled, and, in some cells, the accumulation of membrane damage renders them irreversibly sickled regardless of the physical state of their hemoglobin molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Thus, HbS polymerization and sickling is not intermittent but constant and incessant, perhaps with each cell sickling to some extent an average of nearly 1500 times per day. However, the kinetics of polymerization demonstrate a delay time between the generation of deoxy-HbS and polymer formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], resulting in many cells failing to sickle until they have passed into a vessel too large to be occluded by sickled cells.
