In toddlers, metaphyseal corner or bucket handle fractures are highly associated with child abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orthopedic-aspects-of-child-abuse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orthopedic aspects of child abuse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other patterns of injury correspond to the age of the child and the type of force [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young children (three to nine years of age) are at risk for greenstick or complete metaphyseal fractures when valgus or varus stress is applied. Jumping on a trampoline with other children is a common mechanism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older children (10 to 12 years of age) are at risk for tibial spine avulsion from hyperextension and rotation injury (eg, most commonly a fall from a bicycle or motorbike). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physeal fractures are commonly seen in young adolescents (12 to 14 years of age) and are related to high energy mechanisms (eg, sports injuries, motor vehicle collisions) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 1</a>). These fractures are significantly more common in males than females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tibial tubercle avulsion occurs in older adolescents during active quadriceps contraction with forced flexion of the knee (eg, landing from a jump during basketball, hurdling, high jump or gymnastics or being tackled in American football or rugby). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tibia is the major weight-bearing bone of the lower leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54800 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65590 \">picture 2</a>). The proximal portion of the bone, the tibial plateau, forms the lower surface of the knee joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69611\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69611 \">figure 2</a>). The thicker of the two articular surfaces is the medial tibial condyle, while the lateral tibial condyle is a relatively thinner and weaker portion of the joint. Separating the medial from the lateral tibial condyle is the tibial spine (intercondylar eminence), an important bony prominence that anchors the attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).</p><p>In children, both the tibia and fibula consist of a long portion of bone called the diaphysis. At either end, the bone flares at the metaphysis and terminates in the rounded end of the bone called the epiphysis. The physis, or growth plate, is the active zone of bone lengthening that links the epiphysis to the rest of the bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79444 \">figure 3</a>). The epiphysis of the proximal tibia is a pressure epiphysis and is subject to compressive forces. Injuries to pressure epiphyses and to growth plates can result in growth disturbances.</p><p>The tibial tuberosity is another key landmark located on the anterior surface, one to two centimeters below the joint line and the inferior patellar pole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As the site of attachment for the patellar tendon, the tubercle is subject to tensile forces and thus, both inflammatory and avulsion injuries. However, injury to the tubercle does not pose a risk of growth disturbance.</p><p>The interosseous membrane is a strong fibrous structure that connects the tibia and fibula along the length of the two bones. Proximally, this structure, reinforced by strong anterior and posterior ligaments, forms a synovial joint, the proximal tibiofibular articulation.</p><p>Another fibrous structure, the crural fascia, surrounds the bones and muscles of the lower leg. Fascial extensions and the interosseous membrane separate the muscles, nerves, and vessels of the lower leg into four distinct compartments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66579 \">figure 4</a>). Three of these, the anterior, posterior, and deep posterior compartments, all border the tibia and can be compromised by tibial injury.</p><p>Vascular compromise can arise more proximally from the following etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked knee effusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Popliteal artery injury before it branches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior tibial artery as it branches off the popliteal artery and passes through a gap in the interosseous membrane</p><p/><p>The tibial and common peroneal nerves and their branches provide the key innervation to the muscles of the lower leg and foot. The tibial nerve parallels the course of the posterior tibial artery and courses through the deep posterior compartment. In the popliteal space, branches of the tibial nerve provide innervation to the posterior compartment and to the popliteus muscle. The common peroneal nerve divides to form the superficial and deep peroneal nerves, providing innervation to the muscles in the lateral and anterior lower leg, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different mechanisms account for the different types of proximal tibial fractures seen in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metaphyseal fractures</strong> &ndash; Two types of mechanisms are associated with these injuries:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metaphyseal corner or bucket handle fractures result from intentional pulling and rotation forces applied to the leg when a toddler is grabbed by the ankle or rapid acceleration and deceleration forces, such as when an infant is shaken violently while the legs are dangling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metaphyseal greenstick or complete fractures occur from medial (varus stress) or lateral (valgus stress) forces applied to the lower leg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Proximal tibial physeal fractures</strong> &ndash; These fractures are most common in young adolescent patients who sustain high energy trauma during sports or motor vehicle collisions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tibial spine fractures</strong> &ndash; This fracture results from a hyperextension of the knee with concurrent rotation of the femur on the tibia. It is the same mechanism as an ACL injury in older patients and patients may have concomitant ACL injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tibial tubercle avulsion fractures</strong> &ndash; These injuries typically occur during forced flexion against actively contracting quadriceps (eg, an adolescent planting a leg to dunk a basketball) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100564\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100564 \">figure 5</a>). </p><p/><p>Repeated flexion of the knee occurs in athletes who kick and jump or who climb steps for training. These activities engage the quadriceps muscles and exert force on the patellar tendon and its insertion site, the tibial tubercle. This repeated pulling on the tubercle in young adolescents may lead to an apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osgood-schlatter-disease-tibial-tuberosity-avulsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tuberosity avulsion)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination of children with suspected tibial fractures is described in greater detail separately.

These patients usually are unable to walk.</p><p>Additional findings of specific fractures are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Proximal physeal tibial fractures</strong> &ndash; Patients often demonstrate hemarthrosis and tenderness at the knee joint and are unable to lift the leg due to pain and large muscle spasm. Rarely, posterior displacement of the fracture may cause injury to the popliteal artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100565\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100565 \">figure 6</a>). In such patients, distal pulses or perfusion of the foot are typically diminished and ischemia may be present. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Vascular compromise'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hyperextension of the knee during the exam should also be avoided to prevent vascular compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These fractures are associated with ipsilateral femoral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tibial shaft fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metaphyseal fractures</strong> &ndash; The toddler with a corner or bucket handle fracture typically limps or refuses to bear weight, but the exam may otherwise not reveal any localized swelling or deformity.

Complicated fractures may require additional imaging (eg, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) in consultation with a radiologist or orthopedic surgeon to fully characterize the injury. In addition, fractures that are irreducible may have entrapped periosteum that is best visualized by MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Toddlers with abusive tibial metaphyseal injuries may have a small triangle of avulsed bone (the &quot;corner fracture&quot;) or may show the C-shape of a bucket handle if the x-ray beam is directed obliquely to capture the sub-periosteal layer that is pulled away from the bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60912\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60912 \">figure 7</a>).

The clinician should evaluate unstable patients and those with a high risk trauma mechanism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 1</a>) according to the principles of advanced trauma life support (ATLS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 8</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular compromise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proximal tibial fractures may rarely cause vascular compromise if accompanied by marked effusion of the knee joint <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior fracture displacement with impingement of the popliteal or anterior tibial artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65590 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65878\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65878 \">image 1</a>). In these children, distal pulses and perfusion are diminished and severe ischemic pain is often present.</p><p>The emergency clinician should promptly identify children with vascular insufficiency and emergently involve an orthopedic surgeon with appropriate pediatric expertise. Rarely, these children will require partial closed reduction in the emergency department in an attempt to restore distal circulation. Patients who display a cold, white, or cyanotic foot despite reduction attempts require operative exploration and vascular repair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Open fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to pain management and immobilization, children with an open proximal tibial fracture should receive antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 2</a>). The antibiotic regimen should target Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefazolin</a> and an aminoglycoside) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Consultation with a specialist in infectious disease is appropriate for patients whose wounds are contaminated with unusual substances (eg, animal feces, flood water).</p><p>Open fractures of the proximal tibia warrant prompt orthopedic consultation for operative debridement and repair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute compartment syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compartment syndrome may rarely occur prior to or after definitive orthopedic care of a proximal tibial fracture. When compartment syndrome is suspected based on clinical findings, immediate management includes relieving all external pressure on the compartment. Any dressing, splint, cast, or other restrictive covering should be removed. The limb should NOT be elevated. Elevation can diminish arterial inflow and exacerbate ischemia.</p><p>Suspected compartment syndrome should prompt emergent orthopedic consultation. Compartment pressure measurement helps identify patients in need of fasciotomy, the definitive treatment for decompression of all involved compartments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Measurement of compartment pressures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Child protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of a metaphyseal fracture (corner or bucket handle fracture) in a toddler is highly suggestive of child abuse and should prompt involvement of an experienced child protection team (eg, social worker, nurse, physician with more extensive experience in the management of child abuse), if available. In many parts of the world (including the US, UK, and Australia), a mandatory report to appropriate governmental authorities is also required for cases of suspected abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-social-and-medicolegal-issues#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Social and medicolegal issues&quot;, section on 'Reporting suspected abuse'</a>.) </p><p>Children under two years of age with suspected intentional trauma on the basis of concerning injury patterns (eg, corner or bucket handle fracture) warrant further evaluation guided by a child abuse specialist.

When recognized, they warrant long-term orthopedic follow-up for the expected growth arrest with shortening of the affected extremity.</p><p>Generally, all physeal fractures require long-term orthopedic follow-up to monitor for growth arrest. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Metaphyseal fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metaphyseal fractures warrant prompt orthopedic consultation. Orthopedic treatment of proximal tibial metaphyseal fractures is dictated by the mechanism of injury. Typical low energy mechanisms occur in younger children, age three to six, and manifest as buckle or incomplete fractures through the proximal tibial and fibular metaphyses. These are routinely managed with closed reduction and casting. </p><p>High energy mechanisms cause complete transverse fractures with displacement and are usually found in an adolescent age group. These often require surgical stabilization and careful, repeated evaluation to exclude the possibility of vascular injury or compartment syndrome. </p><p>If closed reduction and long leg casting with the knee in extension are performed, radiographs of both tibias should be taken to ensure that the injured tibia is adequately aligned.</p><p>Toddlers with metaphyseal corner or bucket handle fractures are treated in a long leg cast with the knee in extension. These patients warrant additional evaluation for child abuse.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cast and splint care (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Home pain management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proximal tibial injuries are often very painful. Most clinicians choose to provide a prescription for a limited amount of opioid pain medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxycodone</a>). In some cases (eg, children with nondisplaced metaphyseal fractures or Salter-Harris I fractures and minimal pain), opioid medications are not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common complications of proximal tibial fractures in children are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valgus deformity &ndash; Fractures of the proximal tibial metaphysis are prone to develop a progressive valgus angular deformity, despite anatomic alignment during the initial treatment. This may be a reflection of altered growth mechanics about the proximal tibial physis. The vast majority of the progressive valgus will resolve spontaneously over three years. However, close orthopedic follow-up is needed for those few cases where osteotomy may be necessary to correct the angulation if it does not resolve. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Popliteal artery injury &ndash; With a significant hyperextension injury, a posteriorly displaced proximal tibial shaft can tent the popliteal artery. In one series of 30 proximal tibial epiphyseal injuries, 16 (53 percent) were displaced and three had peripheral ischemia at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another series of 39 proximal tibial epiphyseal fractures, two patients had popliteal artery disruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Good outcomes require prompt recognition of vascular compromise with emergent operative fracture reduction and vascular exploration. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth disturbance &ndash; Accelerated longitudinal growth after a proximal tibial fracture is less common than with femur fractures, but children less than 10 years of age and those with comminution are at potential risk for overgrowth and leg length discrepancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-tibial-fractures-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children have full recovery of function after proximal tibial fractures. Children with complete or greenstick metaphyseal fractures, or fractures complicated by vascular insufficiency, are at the greatest risk for complications. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

They usually are unable to ambulate. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The emergency clinician should promptly identify children with vascular insufficiency and emergently involve an orthopedic surgeon with appropriate pediatric expertise. Rarely, these children will require partial closed reduction in the emergency department in an attempt to restore distal circulation. Patients who display a cold, white or cyanotic foot despite reduction attempts require operative exploration and vascular repair. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Vascular compromise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to pain management and immobilization, patients with open fractures should receive antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 2</a>). The antibiotic regimen should target Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefazolin</a> and an aminoglycoside). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Open fractures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transverse fractures of the proximal tibia are typically high-energy injuries that warrant careful evaluation for compartment syndrome and, less commonly, popliteal artery injury. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral plain radiographic views of the lower leg, including the knee and ankle, provide appropriate initial imaging in the child with a suspected proximal tibia fracture. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metaphyseal fractures, most physeal fractures, displaced tibial tubercle fractures, open fractures, fractures involving the articular surface, and fractures complicated by acute compartment syndrome or vascular compromise warrant prompt orthopedic consultation. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consultation or referral'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with closed proximal tibial fractures and no sign of neurovascular compromise or multiple trauma, initial management focuses on pain management, immobilization of the fracture, and reduction of swelling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in children&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive management of proximal tibial fractures depends on the bone affected, the type of fracture, and the degree of displacement. Transverse proximal tibial fractures caused by high force mechanisms often warrant reduction, bivalving of the cast, and admission to monitor for compartment syndrome and vascular insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Definitive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with nondisplaced proximal tibial fractures should be provided with immobilization (splint or cast), made non-weightbearing, and instructed to keep the fracture site elevated above the level of the heart as much as possible for the first 48 hours after injury. These patients may be discharged home with orthopedic follow-up. The timing of follow-up depends on the type of fracture. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Definitive care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Discharge and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of a metaphyseal corner or bucket handle fracture in a toddler should prompt involvement of an experienced child protection team (eg, social worker, nurse, physician with more extensive experience in the management of child abuse), if available. In many parts of the world (including the US, UK, and Australia), a mandatory report to appropriate governmental authorities is also required for cases of suspected abuse. These patients also warrant further evaluation guided by a child abuse specialist.
