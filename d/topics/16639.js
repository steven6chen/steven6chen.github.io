Due to a lack of nonsurgical options for severely obese adolescents and a demonstrated safety and efficacy record in adults, there has been increasing interest in surgical procedures for weight loss (&quot;bariatric surgery&quot;) for selected obese adolescents with severe obesity. There is insufficient evidence bearing on safety or effectiveness to recommend use of surgery for children or preadolescents at this time. </p><p>The rationale, outcomes, and indications for weight loss surgery in adolescents will be reviewed here. The management and outcomes of weight loss surgery in adults and other aspects of obesity in children and adolescents are discussed separately.

Therefore, treatment that is targeted at obesity may treat or prevent these problems and improve long-term health outcomes.

It also reduces mortality, as highlighted in a 10-year follow-up of patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), adjustable gastric banding (AGB), or vertical banded gastroplasty in the Swedish Obese Subjects Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operations-for-management-of-obesity-indications-and-preoperative-preparation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operations for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Weight loss surgery has been performed in small groups of adolescents since the late 1970s. An analysis of representative national hospital administrative data from the United States demonstrated that between 2000 and 2003, the rate of surgical weight loss procedures in adolescents tripled to an estimated 771 procedures nationwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Since then, case volumes have continued to increase, with an estimated 1600 procedures in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Nonetheless, less than 1 percent of the weight loss surgery procedures in the United States are performed in adolescents. As of 2014, the majority of adult bariatric cases (&gt;60 percent) in the United States were sleeve gastrectomy (SG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and it is likely that this procedure is also the most commonly performed bariatric operation in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Defining severe obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When evaluating the risks and benefits of surgery, an important step is to identify the group of patients that are most likely to benefit from the intervention. In adults, severe obesity is generally defined as a BMI &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. This is also the BMI threshold for consideration of surgery as proposed by an NIH consensus panel; a threshold of 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> is used for adults with significant current comorbidities such as diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-operations-for-management-of-obesity-indications-and-preoperative-preparation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric operations for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In children, severe obesity is defined as a BMI that is either &ge;120 percent of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile or &ge;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (whichever is lower) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90747%7EPEDS%2F91083\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90747 graphicRef91083 \">figure 1A-B</a>)[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. BMI &ge;120 percent of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile is higher than BMI 35 for girls older than 16 years, and for boys older than 18 years. This threshold corresponds to approximately the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile (Z-score 2.33), but is preferred because the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) growth standards are not sufficiently precise to use percentile curves at the extremes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Using this definition, approximately 7 percent of girls and 9.7 percent of boys 12 to 19 years have severe obesity in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These children will almost always remain in the obese range as adults, and 65 percent will have Class III obesity as adults (BMI &ge;40) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. They have a significantly greater prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors as compared with children with lesser degrees of obesity, and will have more health complications and higher mortality as compared with those who developed obesity during adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the potential risks of surgical weight loss, noninvasive approaches should always be the first-line treatment for any child or adolescent with obesity. The best established approaches are multidisciplinary, using family-based behavioral techniques to support changes in diet and physical activity, with goals of reducing caloric intake, improving the quality of the food intake, and increasing energy expenditure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Recommendations from an expert committee, endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other professional organizations, advocate a staged approach to weight management based on the child's degree of obesity and response to previous interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/15,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,25</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, the limited data available suggest that dietary and behavioral interventions alone rarely achieve significant long-term success for individuals with severe obesity, as illustrated by the following examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized study of 209 children ages 8 to 16 years, with a high degree of obesity (baseline mean BMI Z-score 2.47 (SD 0.34), those treated with a one year intensive lifestyle intervention experienced a modest -1.7 unit decrease in BMI as compared with those given routine clinical counseling (95% CI: -2.3 to -1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Seventy-one percent of families completed the intensive weight management arm, with a slightly greater drop-out rate in the counseling control group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large study examined three-year outcomes of behavioral treatment of severely obese children and adolescents in Sweden. Among severely obese young children (&lt;10 years of age), 58 percent experienced a clinically meaningful treatment response (reduction of BMI standard deviation score by at least 0.5). However, only 2 percent of severely obese adolescents showed a clinically meaningful response. Both age and severity of obesity were found to be predictors of response to behavioral treatment of pediatric obesity, leading authors to question the value of behavioral treatment for such adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When clinically significant weight loss is achieved through intensive lifestyle modification therapy, the improvement is rarely sustained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This was shown in a study of 192 children with severe obesity, who underwent a 6-month intensive lifestyle intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. At the end of the intervention, the group had lost 7.58 percent of body weight, compared with 0.66 percent decrease with usual care, but the differences were no longer significant one year later. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obese adolescents treated with behavioral therapy (eg, those randomized to placebo with behavioral therapy, as controls in pharmaceutical studies for weight loss) have typically demonstrated &lt;3 percent weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In addition, in a study from Sweden, adolescents with severe obesity experienced a 6 percent weight gain over five years of follow-up, an informative finding given the 100 percent study visit completion rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p>While an increasing number of obesity drugs are becoming available for adults, pharmacotherapy options for adolescents (eg, medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] for use in youth) are very limited, and are unlikely to be clinically useful in those with severe obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Orlistat</a> is the only medication that is approved in the United States for the indication of weight loss in adolescents; it has low efficacy (placebo-subtracted BMI reduction of &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Metformin</a> has been studied for weight loss (an off-label use) in several randomized trials, but demonstrated only modest placebo-subtracted BMI reductions of about 1.1 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Pharmacotherapy for adults with obesity, including drugs in development, is discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-drug-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Drug therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most widely performed procedures in adolescents and adults are the sleeve gastrectomy (SG; &gt;60 percent) and roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB; &lt;30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Far fewer adjustable gastric band (AGB; &lt;5 percent) procedures are performed. Details of these procedures and the experience in adults are discussed in a separate topic review (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions#H16056874\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions&quot;, section on 'Contemporary procedures'</a>). Outcomes of these procedures and considerations specific to adolescents are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H415346736\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7607762\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleeve gastrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SG (also known as vertical sleeve gastrectomy) is a partial gastrectomy, in which the majority of the greater curvature of the stomach is removed, creating a tubular stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F54612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54612 \">figure 2</a>). The frequency of this procedure for weight loss surgery has been rapidly increasing, and it accounts for approximately 80 percent of bariatric procedures in adolescents. It was originally performed as the first part of a two-stage weight loss procedure for high risk extremely obese adults, but because it often achieves excellent weight loss outcomes, it is now often used as a stand-alone procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Data on very long-term outcomes is pending. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions#H2185083637\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions&quot;, section on 'Sleeve gastrectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Because SG is less complex than RYGB and has a lower theoretical risk of micronutrient deficiencies, it is an attractive option for adolescents. Additionally, if patients regain weight in the long term, the SG can be converted to a RYGB. Outcomes for weight loss and comorbidity improvement are generally excellent, although the long-term weight loss may be less than for RYGB, at least for a subset of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Compared with AGB, SG has the advantage of avoiding a foreign body and potential associated complications. (See <a href=\"#H415346736\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below.) </p><p>SG may be a particularly appropriate choice of procedure for individuals with cognitive deficits, younger age, or other issues that might increase risk for postoperative nutritional deficiencies. However, outcomes for these special populations remain unclear because the only information is from very small case series with several years follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H415346073\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415344196\"><span class=\"h2\">Roux-en-Y gastric bypass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) creates a small (less than 30 mL) proximal gastric pouch that is divided and separated from the distal stomach and anastomosed to a Roux-limb of small bowel 75 to 150 cm in length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79256\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79256 \">figure 3</a>). The surgery has been the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in the United States until more recently, but now accounts for about 20 percent of procedures in adolescents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions#H205574861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions&quot;, section on 'Roux-en-Y gastric bypass'</a>.)</p><p>The long-term outcomes for weight loss and comorbidity improvement are well established for RYGB, based on more than 25 years of experience with this procedure in adults. In addition, it has particularly dramatic benefits on glycemic control, which may offer some advantage for patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. On the other hand, there are probably more risks for nutritional deficiencies compared with SG. In particular, iron sufficiency and long-term outcomes for bone health after RYGB are not well studied. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery#H353466713\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical outcomes following bariatric surgery&quot;, section on 'Diabetes mellitus'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415344370\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjustable gastric band</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjustable gastric banding (AGB) is a purely restrictive procedure that compartmentalizes the upper stomach by placing a tight, adjustable prosthetic band around the entrance to the stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57064\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57064 \">figure 4</a>). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two AGB devices for use in adults in the United States, but these devices are not FDA-approved for adolescents younger than age 18. Numerous retrospective studies of adolescents have been published with favorable results, although the weight loss achieved is probably less than for SG and RYGB (see <a href=\"#H415346736\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below). Lack of FDA approval and the increasing trend for use of SG has resulted in rapidly declining use of AGB in adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], so that it now represents &lt;1 percent of all adolescent bariatric procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7607776\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, the range of surgical weight loss procedures performed on adults and a few adolescents included jejunoileal bypass (a procedure associated with a high rate of malabsorptive complications), vertical banded gastroplasty, and banded gastric bypass. Due to unsatisfactory safety profiles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> efficacy, these procedures are no longer recommended. Other procedures that cause malabsorption, such as biliopancreatic diversion, are occasionally performed on adults but are generally not recommended for adolescents due to lack of safety data in this age group and concerns about long-term nutritional complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF WEIGHT LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduction of caloric intake plays an important role in the dramatic weight loss produced by bariatric surgery. However, this is only partially attributable to a reduced capacity of the stomach or pouch. Many patients report a subjective decrease in appetite and increase in postprandial satiety after surgery, which helps them maintain lower intake of food. This experience suggests that the effects of bariatric surgery on weight loss and comorbidities may have neuroendocrine mechanisms, and are entirely attributable to mechanical restriction of food intake or of malabsorption.</p><p>Emerging data suggest that alterations in neuroenteric hormones that regulate appetite and energy expenditure could contribute to changes in satiety after surgery. Several studies have demonstrated an increase in postprandial total peptide YY concentrations (both PYY and PYY3-36) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) compared with lean or obese nonoperative controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. This postprandial increase in PYY is not reported after an adjustable gastric band (AGB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. However, a single series of 12 patients undergoing the vertical banded gastroplasty (also purely restrictive) reported an increase in fasting and postprandial PYY concentrations after surgery to levels comparable to concentrations measured in lean controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In addition, bile acid signaling, mediated through the farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR), appears to be integral to achieving the weight loss and beneficial metabolic effects of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in rodent models of bariatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Studies in adults have also demonstrated a rise in circulating total bile acids after RYGB, and to a lesser degree after SG; however, no significant change was demonstrated after AGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Bile acids have also been shown to rise significantly in adolescents as well during the rapid weight loss phase in the first three months after SG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Dramatic improvements in insulin resistance and diabetes occur after RYGB, even prior to any significant weight loss. These changes may in part be due to increased secretion of incretins, such as glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) by intestinal endocrine cells after surgery. After RYGB, postprandial GLP-1 plasma levels rise dramatically compared with levels in lean and obese controls, and compared with patients undergoing AGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms through which bariatric surgery causes this abrupt enhancement of insulin sensitivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415345737\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND SCREENING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415345744\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommended screening prior to surgical weight loss procedures includes evaluation for the presence and severity of coexisting diseases, as well as assessment of the patient's and family's understanding and readiness for a life-changing and often permanent procedure. Recommended screening tests and evaluations that should be completed during the evaluation are highlighted in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55342\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55342 \">table 1</a>). The final decision on whether to proceed with surgery must be made by the multidisciplinary team, taking into consideration both objective and subjective assessments of the patient's severity of obesity and related diseases, risk of future health problems, failure to lose weight through more conventional means, psychosocial status and support, and patient and family readiness for surgery.</p><p>A multidisciplinary approach is recommended when offering weight loss surgery to adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. At a minimum, the team evaluating and caring for the candidate should include an experienced bariatric surgeon, pediatric obesity specialist, nurse, dietician, and pediatric psychologist or psychiatrist. One of these providers or an additional team member should have responsibility for coordinating each patient's care and ensuring follow-up and adherence to the prescribed medical regimen.

These are the same BMI thresholds used to select adults for bariatric surgery. Note that use of these fixed BMI thresholds is naturally more conservative for younger patients, in that the fixed threshold corresponds to a higher BMI percentile or Z-score in younger compared with older adolescents or adults. In particular, a BMI &ge;40 represents very severe obesity in younger patients, particularly those younger than 16 years, in whom this threshold is substantially higher than the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile curve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90747%7EPEDS%2F91083\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90747 graphicRef91083 \">figure 1A-B</a>) (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Defining severe obesity'</a> above).

This criterion is based on theoretical concerns that rapid weight loss after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) might inhibit statural growth if an adolescent has not reached near adult height. There is no specific evidence that performing a bariatric procedure before this threshold is reached has adverse effects on height. Also, the concern may not be relevant for adjustable gastric band (AGB) procedures because weight loss is usually more gradual. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;, section on 'Sexual maturity rating (Tanner stages)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-child-with-tall-stature-and-or-abnormally-rapid-growth#H372149722\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The child with tall stature and/or abnormally rapid growth&quot;, section on 'Bone age'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of sustained efforts to lose weight through changes in diet and physical activity. There is no evidence that prolonged preoperative weight management programs enhance selection of patients for weight loss surgery. However, consistent attendance in such a treatment program may be a valuable indicator of the patient's ability to understand and adhere to medical and nutritional recommendations postoperatively.</p><p/><p>These guidelines rest primarily on expert opinion and retrospectively evaluated outcomes data. There is only one randomized controlled trial in adolescents that demonstrates superiority of surgical weight loss as compared with conventional medical therapy for the severe comorbidities listed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, randomized controlled trials in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus have demonstrated that bariatric surgery (including RYGB, AGB, and sleeve gastrectomy [SG]) is significantly more effective than conventional or intensive medical therapy in resolution of type 2 diabetes mellitus at one and two years postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>It should be recognized that the above criteria alone are not sufficient to select the patients who are most likely to benefit from weight loss surgery during adolescence. We recommend that the multidisciplinary team consider carefully whether the patient and family have the ability and motivation to adhere to recommended treatments pre- and postoperatively, including consistent use of micronutrient supplements. Evidence may include a history of reliable attendance at office visits for weight management and compliance with other medical needs. In addition, the team should consider whether the adolescent shows evidence of mature decision-making, with appropriate understanding of the risks and benefits of surgery, and has support but not coercion from family members. </p><p>Many experts believe that earlier surgical intervention probably is beneficial for adolescents with progressively worsening obesity (analogous to the surgical approach for cancers). This opinion is based upon indirect evidence from observational studies in adolescents and adults in which lower BMI at baseline generally predicts lower absolute BMI after surgery. Since on average, bariatric surgery results in a loss of 25 to 30 percent of BMI, treatment rendered earlier after the diagnosis of severe obesity is more likely to result in postoperative BMI values that are in the healthier ranges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. No studies have directly addressed the timing of surgical intervention relative to BMI trend or age.

There is limited evidence that weight loss surgery, and SG in particular, may be safe and beneficial in patients with cognitive deficits, younger age, or other issues that might increase risk for postoperative nutritional deficiencies. Outcomes of SG for these populations are based on small case series with several years follow-up. As an example, two overlapping case series of 226 pediatric patients undergoing SG included seven patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, two with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, three with mental retardation, and one with Down syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. There were no deaths and no major complications. Although the series included 74 prepubertal patients, the data collection and follow-up are insufficient to determine the safety and outcomes of SG in this younger age group. A separate study on an overlapping population included 19 children ages 5 through 8.99 years and 56 children 9 to 13.99 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Children in both age groups experienced good linear growth during the first few years after weight loss surgery. </p><p>One contemporary study reports benefits of a narrow SG for individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome, most with two to five years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. However, more investigation is required before use of weight loss surgery for patients with Prader-Willi or other syndromes can be widely recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. In particular, it is unclear whether long-term durability of weight loss after SG in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome will be achieved, and the type and frequency of adverse events is inadequately explored.

Specialized equipment, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanners, often have weight limitations, which may preclude their use for these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Further, basic equipment such as operating tables, stretchers, scales, beds, and toilets that can support extreme weight ranges must be available to ensure safety of the patient and caretakers.</p><p>To prevent the development of venous thromboembolism, we recommend the use of compression boots until the patient is ambulatory. Patients at increased risk for deep vein thrombosis and thromboembolism (eg, those with severely impaired mobility or a hypercoagulable state) are often treated with low-molecular weight heparin in the perioperative period.

The advancement to regular foods is slow, occurring over the first six months after surgery. For best results, the patient is encouraged to eat three to four small, high-protein meals per day and to avoid high-fat and carbohydrate foods, as these may provoke malabsorptive or dumping side effects. Supplemental fluids are encouraged to avoid dehydration (64 to 92 ounces per day of sugar-free, noncarbonated beverages). Drinks should be sugar-free to avoid dumping syndrome and weight regain through overconsumption of liquid calories. Patients also are advised to avoid drinking during meals to avoid nausea and vomiting. Some patients experience greater degrees of nausea in the first postoperative month after SG as compared with RYGB, requiring addition of anti-emetics and antinausea medications. Typically, however, this resolves over time. </p><p>Follow-up visits are typically performed at two weeks postoperatively, then 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery. After that, annual follow-up is recommended for monitoring of anthropometric measurements, nutritional status, residual comorbidities, and general health. Follow-up for AGB patients typically is more frequent due to the need for band adjustments.

The effects of bariatric surgery on menstrual irregularities and anovulation in adolescents has not been established.

In most of these long-term studies, a substantial number of subjects were lost to follow-up, which could bias findings.</p><p>Despite these limitations, these studies confirm that clinically significant and durable weight loss can be achieved in most patients by either SG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/58,59,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59,79</a>] or RYGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/80-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-83</a>], while AGB is probably somewhat less effective, with slower and less weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/54,84-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,84-89</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of 37 studies reported substantial weight loss with any of these procedures. Mean BMI loss was 16.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> for RYGB, 14.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> for SG, and 11.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</span> </sup>for AGB; these differences were not statistically significant, and comparison of outcomes was limited by lack of randomization among the procedures and different lengths of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Of note, the nadir postoperative BMI tends to be lower in patients with less severe obesity preoperatively as compared with those with more severe obesity, although the percent BMI change is similar. In a large series of patients from a single center undergoing RYGB, the mean nadir postoperative BMI was 31, 38, and 47 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> for patients with starting BMIs between 40 to 54, 55 to 65, and &gt;65 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. </p><p>It is not clear to what degree weight loss will be sustained in adolescents and whether comorbid conditions will recur if significant weight is regained in long-term follow-up. Two studies with 4 to 10 years of follow-up suggest that 10 to 15 percent of patients regain significant weight after RYGB procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/80,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,91</a>]. Specific predictors of weight regain after surgical weight loss procedures are unknown for adults and adolescents. There is still insufficient information to directly compare the long-term weight loss outcomes of SG with those for RYGB or AGB in adolescents. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415347550\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidity improvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight loss surgery results in resolution of or improvement in most obesity-related diseases in both adults and adolescents. The most dramatic improvements have been seen in insulin resistance, triglyceride levels, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and renal function, as well as depression and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/4,37,57,84,88,92-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,37,57,84,88,92-99</a>]. In the Teen-LABS study described above, type 2 diabetes resolved in 95 percent of the participants who had the condition at baseline, and other comorbidities also resolved in most patients, including prediabetes, elevated blood pressure, and dyslipidemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106065\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106065 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Similar improvements were seen in two studies with more than five-year outcomes, demonstrating long-term durability of these important metabolic effects of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/31,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,57</a>]. Another Teen-LABS analysis highlighted kidney function, a seldom reported outcome after bariatric surgery. Among severely obese adolescents with impaired kidney function at baseline (eGFR &lt;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">ml/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>), mean eGFR improved from 76 <span class=\"nowrap\">ml/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> to 102 <span class=\"nowrap\">ml/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2 </sup>at three years follow-up (p&lt;0.0001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Similarly, participants with evidence of kidney injury (albuminuria) at baseline demonstrated a significant improvement of albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR); geometric mean of ACR was 74 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> at baseline, and decreased to 17 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g</span> at three years (p&lt;0.0001). Those with normal renal function and no albuminuria at baseline remained stable throughout the study period. In the same cohort, there were substantial improvements in functional mobility, as demonstrated by a 400-meter walk test, and in musculoskeletal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. The metabolic improvements are consistent with the observation that weight loss after surgery is accompanied by a significant reduction in body fat (from 51 percent to 37 percent in one series) with relative preservation of lean body mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. One study also showed improvements in obesity-associated cardiac abnormalities, including concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic function, as measured by echocardiogram performed before and 10 &plusmn; 3 months after RYGB surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p>Bariatric surgery leads to improvements in psychosocial functioning, at least in the short term. In the Teen-LABS study, quality of life improved substantially after weight loss surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In a pilot study of 16 adolescents undergoing RYGB, a substantial reduction in depressive symptoms occurred over the first postoperative year, accompanied by improvements in measures of health-related quality of life and self-concept (social, appearance, and close-friendship) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. However these improvements decelerated in the second postoperative year, accompanied by modest weight regain and slight increase in depressive symptoms, as well as declines in measures of health related quality of life, including social, body esteem, physical comfort and total domains, as well as self-concept. Another study of 37 adolescents undergoing RYGB showed that anxiety and depression symptoms were higher at baseline than gender-specific norms, but declined significantly by four months after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. There was no change in anger and disruptive behavior symptoms. Larger and more long-term studies are required to better understand the impact of bariatric surgery on psychosocial functioning in adolescents. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415347834\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-term complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-term complications (&lt;30 days after surgery) are generally similar to those in adults. Complications after RYGB include intestinal leakage at anastomotic sites, wound infections, pulmonary embolus, gastrojejunal strictures requiring endoscopic dilatation, small bowel obstruction, gastrogastric fistula formation, and symptomatic cholelithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Complications of SG also include leak at the staple line. SG patients also may experience heightened and more protracted nausea in the first month postoperatively, compared with patients undergoing RYGB. Complications of AGB procedures in adolescents and adults include band slippage requiring repositioning, gastric obstruction, and esophageal or gastric pouch dilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p>Among the 242 participants in the Teen-LABS study cited above there were 20 major complications within 30 days of surgery (8 percent overall; RYGB 9 percent, SG 5 percent and AGB 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Major complications included reoperation for bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">obstruction/bleeding</span> leak or sepsis, postoperative bleeding requiring transfusion, or intraoperative splenic injury. There were 47 minor complications (15 percent overall; RYGB 17 percent, SG 12 percent and AGB 7 percent). Most major and minor complications occurred prior to discharge from the hospital, and there were no deaths. Thus, short-term complications appear to be somewhat lower for patients undergoing SG as compared with those undergoing RYGB. Although AGB appears to offer a short-term advantage in complication rates, the procedure also is associated with greater long-term risks for revisional surgery, as described below. (See <a href=\"#H415347949\" class=\"local\">'Long-term complications'</a> below.) </p><p>Several studies performed in the United States suggest weight loss surgery may be somewhat safer in adolescents as compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The reason for this is unknown, but the observation may reflect a better state of health among individuals undergoing surgery at a young age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A national analysis of weight loss surgery using utilization codes revealed no perioperative mortality and a significantly shorter length of stay in adolescents as compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Five percent of adolescent patients had major complications, but the majority (78.3 percent) was respiratory in nature. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large study comparing the perioperative outcomes of weight loss surgery between 309 adolescents and 55,192 adults (&gt;18 years) found that the overall 30-day complication rate was significantly lower in adolescents (5.5 percent) as compared with adults (9.8 percent). There was no difference in <span class=\"nowrap\">observed/expected</span> mortality ratios. The 30-day morbidity and mortality rates for adolescents following restrictive procedures (AGB and vertical banded gastroplasty) were nil, compared with the morbidity rate of 4.3 percent for laparoscopic RYGB, and 7.6 percent for open RYGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H415347949\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term complications of weight loss surgery in adolescents are primarily nutritional. In particular, patients are at risk for deficiencies of iron, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin B12</a>, vitamin D, and thiamine. In a study that focused on adolescents and young adults undergoing RYGB with long-term outcomes (FABS-5+ study cited above), low ferritin levels were noted in 63 percent, mild anemia in 46 percent, elevated parathyroid hormone in 45 percent, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency in 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]; the subjects' adherence to routinely prescribed nutritional supplements was not reported. In the Teen-LABS study, the prevalence of low ferritin levels rose from 5 percent at baseline to 57 percent three years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The prevalence of low ferritin levels increased after either RYGB or SG, but was particularly common after RYGB. Vitamin D insufficiency (indicated by low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D) was noted in 42 percent of participants, but this rate was only slightly and not significantly increased over baseline. Vitamin B12 deficiency rose after both RYGB and AGB, while vitamin A deficiency increased from 6 to 16 percent in only those who had undergone RYGB. These observations suggest that nutritional deficiencies are common in this population, particularly among adolescents undergoing RYGB, and need to be monitored and managed over the long term. &#160;</p><p>Because these nutritional deficiencies are common after weight loss surgery, lifelong vitamin and mineral supplementation is imperative. However, adherence to supplementation regimens among adolescents may be poor; one study reported that only 13 percent of adolescents were adherent to all prescribed nutritional supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/80,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,91</a>]. The specific recommendations are outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional supplements'</a> above.)</p><p>RYGB is associated with reduced bone mass in adults and is probably caused by a combination of reduced mechanical load, changes in adipogenic hormones, and nutritional deficiencies. In adolescents, reduced bone mass has been noted two years after weight loss surgery, but remains appropriate for the individual's age and new body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. As in adults, long-term studies are lacking, and the clinical implications of these changes are unclear. However, these findings underscore the importance of supplementing and monitoring vitamin D and calcium after weight loss surgery. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional supplements'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional monitoring'</a> above.) </p><p>Recurrent episodes of severe postprandial hypoglycemia may develop after RYGB and SG in some adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/108-110\" class=\"abstract_t\">108-110</a>]. The mechanism of these hypoglycemic episodes is not known but may result in part from increased incretin secretion after surgery, pancreatic islet cell hyperplasia, and inappropriate postprandial hyperinsulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Although a similar syndrome in adolescents after RYGB has not yet been reported in the literature, at least one adolescent patient in the authors' weight loss surgery program developed severe postprandial hyperinsulinemia after RYGB. Dietary management by providing small meals with relatively low content of carbohydrates was successful in controlling symptoms. Therefore, it is important to ask adolescents about symptoms that may suggest postprandial hypoglycemia during follow-up care after weight loss surgery. </p><p>Cholelithiasis is a common complication of any type of weight loss surgery. In the Teen-LABS study, cholecystectomy was required within three years in 8.6 percent of patients (9.9 percent for RYGB and 5.1 percent for SG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. An additional 5 percent of participants required other abdominal operations, including lysis of adhesions, gastrostomy, or ventral or internal hernia repair. </p><p>AGB is associated with a substantial risk of complications requiring revisional surgery during long-term follow-up. As an example, in a series from California in which the mean length of follow-up was one year, 4.7 percent of patients undergoing AGB required reoperation for band revision or removal, compared with a 2.9 percent reoperation rate for patients undergoing RYGB, but the difference was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. In a separate series of 25 adolescent patients undergoing AGB, seven (28 percent) required reoperations during a two year follow-up period, mostly for pouch dilation or tubing injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This reoperation rate is substantially higher than in comparable series of adolescents undergoing RYBG or SG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/78,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,82</a>], and the difference appears to increase over time because more of the reoperations for AGB occur during long-term follow-up. This risk of late complications is particularly relevant when considering the long-term risks and benefits of ABG in a young patient. In adult patients undergoing AGB, reoperations due to complications, including slippage, erosion, or device failure, occur in 10 to 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-severe-obesity-in-adolescents/abstract/113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,114</a>].

Other procedures that cause significant malabsorption are generally not recommended for adolescents due to lack of safety data in this age group and concerns about long-term nutritional complications. Adjustable gastric banding (AGB) is now rarely used, due to suboptimal weight loss for many patients and increasing use of SG. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Types of surgery'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adolescents, severe obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) that is either &ge;120 percent of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile or &ge;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (whichever is lower) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90747%7EPEDS%2F91083\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90747 graphicRef91083 \">figure 1A-B</a>).

This statement is based on mid-term (three year) outcomes in a large prospective cohort study, as well as retrospective studies with outcomes measured less than 10 years postoperatively. Weight loss surgery results in resolution or substantial improvement in comorbidities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F106065\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106065 \">figure 6</a>), and emerging data show potential advantages of earlier surgery and good safety outcomes as compared with adults.

In most cases, there are associated improvements in adiposity, insulin resistance, triglyceride levels, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and impaired quality of life. These outcomes are comparable to those reported for adults undergoing weight loss surgery. Preliminary data suggest that weight loss outcomes at three years postoperatively are comparable between SG and RYGB in adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F105660\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105660 \">figure 5</a>).
