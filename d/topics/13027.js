Apnea of prematurity is most widely defined as cessation of breathing for more than 20 seconds, or a shorter respiratory pause associated with oxygen desaturation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia in infants who are younger than 37 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The frequency of symptoms is inversely proportional to gestational age (GA), and almost all infants with a GA less than 28 weeks are affected.</p><p>The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical presentation of apnea of prematurity are reviewed here. The management of apnea of prematurity is discussed separately.

Apnea of infancy refers to infants with a gestational age (GA) of 37 weeks or greater at the onset of apnea.</p><p>Apnea is classified as central, obstructive, or mixed depending on the presence of continued inspiratory efforts and upper airway obstruction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central apnea &ndash; Inspiratory efforts are absent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive apnea &ndash; Inspiratory efforts persist, but are ineffective in the presence of upper airway obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed apnea &ndash; Upper airway obstruction with inspiratory efforts that precedes or follows central apnea</p><p/><p>Most apnea spells in preterm infants are central or mixed. This was illustrated in a study of physiologic recordings of 2082 apneic episodes in 47 infants: 40 percent of episodes were central, 50 percent were mixed, and 11 percent were obstructive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of note, longer episodes are most likely to be mixed apnea as opposed to short respiratory pauses, which are primarily classified as central apnea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372637696\"><span class=\"h2\">Periodic breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic breathing episodes are characterized by a pattern of alternating breaths and brief respiratory pauses. Although descriptions vary, periodic breathing is usually defined as repetitive cycles of breathing and respiratory pauses that are approximately 5 to 10 seconds in duration. These pauses may be accompanied by modest oxygen desaturation and bradycardia that do not require clinical intervention. Periodic breathing is common in preterm infants. It needs to be differentiated from apnea of prematurity as it typically does not require intervention. In some infants, episodes of severe decreases in the percent of oxygenated hemoglobin measured by pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) need to be addressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H372637470\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of apnea increases with decreasing gestational age (GA).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Term infants &ndash; The incidence of apnea in term infants is quite low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result, the cause of apnea in term infants should be assumed to be pathologic and can include seizure disorder, infection, severe birth asphyxia, intracranial hemorrhage or stroke, drug depression, and micrognathia with obstruction of the airway. (See <a href=\"#H723201127\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderately preterm infants &ndash; In a multicenter study, apnea was diagnosed in 50 percent of infants born between 33 and 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">6/7</span> weeks gestation based on documentation in the medical record [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Persistent apnea was associated with longer hospitalization. However, there was a wide range in the rate of apnea among the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) as the criteria for diagnosing apnea varied. The authors speculated that the true incidence of apnea was underestimated because of underreporting of events. This underestimation of events by nursing documentation has been confirmed by ongoing cardiorespiratory monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very preterm infants &ndash; Apnea occurs in virtually all infants born at less than 28 weeks gestation based on review of cardiorespiratory recordings from pneumography and cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Infants born at 24 to 28 weeks gestation may continue to exhibit apnea beyond 38 weeks postconception, which prolongs their hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], although resolution of apnea is typically complete by around 43 to 44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apnea of prematurity is a developmental disorder that reflects physiologic immaturity rather than a pathologic process. In fetal life, gas exchange occurs via the placenta, and respiratory muscle activity is intermittent. At delivery, the change to postnatal life requires continuous respiratory muscle activity to sustain gas exchange. However, the mechanisms underlying the transition from intermittent to continuous breathing are not fully understood. It is thought that apnea of prematurity is due to disruption of these developmental ventilation control processes due to immaturity resulting in impaired respiratory drive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> failure to maintain airway patency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H366813926\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory drive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central respiratory drive initiates inspiratory effort in response to changes in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>), and pH via input from neural and chemical receptors. The respiratory center in the brain integrates receptor input and transmits neuronal signals via efferent pathways to the respiratory muscles.</p><p>In preterm infants, the immaturity of breathing responses affects all levels of respiratory control, including central and peripheral chemosensitivity and inhibitory pulmonary neuronal signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Based on limited data from physiologic studies in preterm infants and animal studies, the following observations have been made regarding the pathogenesis of central respiratory drive impairment in preterm infants with apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the fetus, descending inhibition from central nervous structures above the brainstem and respiratory depression from the normally low fetal arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) based on arterial blood gas measurement (approximately 25 mmHg) contribute to decreased fetal respiratory activity. After preterm delivery, these mechanisms appear to persist until the infant is able to developmentally adapt to the extrauterine environment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic analysis demonstrates a decreased number of synaptic connections, dendritic arborizations, impaired astrocyte development, and poor myelination. These findings suggest immaturity of the brain contributes to poor ventilatory control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upregulation of inhibitory neurotransmitters regulates respiratory control such as adenosine, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), and endorphins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A (yet to be determined) genetic component appears to be associated with apnea of prematurity, as illustrated by the higher concordance rate of apnea among monozygotic preterm twin pairs compared with same gender dizygotic twins (87 versus 62 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>In preterm infants with apnea, these and other yet to be identified factors appear to disrupt central respiratory drive, as manifested by the impaired ventilatory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercapnia &ndash; The major chemical driver of central respiratory output is elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, which is sensed primarily through brainstem receptors with a smaller contribution from peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies. Preterm infants have a blunted ventilatory response to inhaled CO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The response to CO<sub>2</sub> is even lower in preterm infants with apnea compared with preterm controls matched by gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), and postnatal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This decreased ventilatory response at a given CO<sub>2</sub> level is primarily due to changes in central respiratory drive rather than pulmonary mechanics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoxia &ndash; Increase in ventilation in response to hypoxia is almost exclusively dependent on feedback from carotid body peripheral chemoreceptors situated in the thorax. Preterm infants have a biphasic response to hypoxia with an initial increase (hyperventilation) and subsequent decrease in inspiratory efforts (hypoventilation and sometimes apnea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This biphasic response to hypoxia can persist to 38 weeks postconceptual age and may contribute to the persistence of apnea in some infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although adults may also exhibit a biphasic ventilatory response to hypoxia, the degree of respiratory depression (following the initial increase in ventilation) is not as severe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased peripheral chemosensitivity in response to hypoxia may delay recovery from apnea. As noted above, the normally low fetal PaO<sub>2</sub> results in decreased fetal respiratory activity. With the fourfold increase in oxygen levels at birth, the peripheral chemoreceptors, which have adapted to the low fetal oxygen levels, are initially unresponsive until a subsequent increase in their sensitivity to extrauterine oxygen levels. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to this maturation remain unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased peripheral chemoreceptor responses to hypoxia have also been shown to destabilize breathing in preterm infants and contribute to periodic breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This has been attributed to the fact that the eupneic and apneic PaCO<sub>2</sub> thresholds are very close in preterm infants, and frequent oscillations in breathing elicited by increased peripheral chemosensitivity may drive the eupneic PaCO<sub>2</sub> below the PaCO<sub>2</sub> threshold and induce apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperbilirubinemia &ndash; Although limited, there are data that suggest that unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is associated with central apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The proposed mechanism is that unbound bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier and results in brainstem dysfunction, which would decrease the respiratory drive in response to either hypercapnia or hypoxia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89276269\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper airway patency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patency of the upper airway is essential to the flow of respiratory gases between the environment and the alveolar-capillary interface.</p><p>Factors associated with upper airway obstruction in preterm infants include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collapse of the airway due to poor hypopharyngeal muscle tone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibitory upper airway reflexes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngeal edema</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709775314\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypopharynx</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance of upper airway patency is dependent on the resting tone and active contraction of the hypopharyngeal muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71155\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71155 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The hypopharynx is a frequent site of upper airway obstruction in preterm infants because pharyngeal muscle tone is poor, resulting in airway collapse, especially during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The infant's airway is especially susceptible to collapse when the neck is flexed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H747140\"><span class=\"h3\">Upper airway reflexes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activation or stimulation of inhibitory upper airway reflexes (also referred to as the laryngeal chemoreflex) may contribute to the pathogenesis of apnea, although the mechanism is poorly understood. This reflex appears to be mediated through irritant receptors in the larynx. The reflex response evolves from apnea and bradycardia in early postnatal life to protective coughing and swallowing with advancing maturation. In newborn animal models, for example, milk from a different species or water instilled in the airway resulted in decreased ventilation or apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In human infants, prolonged hypopharyngeal suctioning or aspiration of small volumes of milk also may induce this apneic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, no temporal relationship has been demonstrated between apnea of prematurity and gastroesophageal reflux. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants#H1936014757\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux in premature infants&quot;, section on 'Relationship to apnea'</a>.)</p><p>Viral infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) may also enhance this apneic response, which is a common manifestation of RSV infection. In addition, upper respiratory infection may cause edema and obstruction of the airway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Apnea'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H747224\"><span class=\"h3\">Nasal obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborn infants depend upon a patent nasal airway for adequate ventilation because neonates are obligate or preferential nose breathers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Therefore, apnea may be precipitated by intermittent nasal obstruction from swelling that may occur in association with excessive suctioning during prolonged nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP), or with prolonged use of nasogastric tubes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709775321\"><span class=\"h3\">Larynx and trachea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The larynx and trachea are less common sites of mechanical airway obstruction because these rigid structures are less likely to collapse than the hypopharynx. Nevertheless, mild obstruction caused by laryngeal edema, vocal cord dysfunction, tracheal stenosis, or laryngeal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tracheal malacia can precipitate apnea in some cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89276472\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apnea may become evident in the first two to three days after birth in preterm infants who are breathing spontaneously without respiratory support or being treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Breathing pauses usually are accompanied by bradycardia and hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In infants who are intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation, episodic desaturation and bradycardia are also quite common and are manifestations of ineffective ventilation and possibly cardiorespiratory reflex responses to airway stimulation by an endotracheal tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H747140\" class=\"local\">'Upper airway reflexes'</a> above.)</p><p>Regardless of ventilatory mode, episodic desaturation in preterm infants typically increases in frequency after the second or third week of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These episodes persist for several weeks, especially in infants who have a low baseline oxygen saturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Apnea of prematurity typically resolves before 37 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) in infants delivered after 28 weeks gestation. In contrast, in infants born before 28 weeks, apnea frequently persists until term PMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/6,7,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,28</a>]. However, significant apnea does not typically persist beyond 43 weeks PMA. This was best illustrated in a study that included 443 preterm infants (gestational age [GA] &le;34 weeks) that demonstrated significant cardiorespiratory events were rare beyond 43 weeks PMA and occurred no more frequently in the preterm group than in healthy term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>For infants without previous episodes of apnea after the first few weeks of life or who present with recurrent apnea after one to two weeks without apnea spells, the cause of apnea may be due to a serious underlying pathologic condition such as sepsis. These infants require a thorough evaluation to determine if there is a precipitating cause, which may be treatable. (See <a href=\"#H723201127\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H723201169\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation to determine cause of apnea'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H731875161\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of apnea of prematurity is considered when either a respiratory pause greater than 20 seconds or a shorter respiratory pause accompanied by oxygen desaturation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia is detected in an infant with a gestational age (GA) less than 37 weeks. These events are typically identified by the routine use of cardiorespiratory monitors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulse oximeters for preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Because apnea occurs in most infants born below 28 weeks gestation and in over half of more mature preterm infants, all preterm infants should be monitored for apnea. (See <a href=\"#H372637470\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.) </p><p>However, the diagnosis of apnea of prematurity is a diagnosis of exclusion. Other causes of apnea need to be considered and eliminated before the diagnosis of apnea of prematurity can be conclusively made. This is especially true for any preterm infant in whom there is a recent onset of apnea following a time period without apneic events. (See <a href=\"#H723201127\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H723201169\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation to determine cause of apnea'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H731875168\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonatal cardiorespiratory monitors utilize impedance technology to measure respiration, which only measures chest wall motion. This technology is only effective to diagnose central apnea, and the use of these apnea monitors will miss mixed apnea, which is frequently associated with upper airway closure and continued respiratory muscle activity and obstructive apnea. Monitoring heart rate and oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter provides additional data to ensure that infants with both mixed and obstructive apnea that result in significant decreases in heart rate or percent of oxygenated hemoglobin measured by pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) are also identified.</p><p>Apnea monitor alarms are typically set to identify cessation of respirations of 15 to 20 seconds' duration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H731875175\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart rate monitoring is important in the detection of apnea of prematurity, since bradycardia usually accompanies apnea of prematurity. The decreased heart rate is thought to be a reflex response to a fall in oxygenation. The most frequent reason for persistent cardiorespiratory alarms in preterm infants is short respiratory pauses (&lt;15 seconds) associated with bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. While many centers have traditionally set bradycardia alarms at &lt;80 beats per minute (bpm), we have lowered alarm settings to 70 bpm in convalescing preterm infants to decrease the frequency of alarms without apparent adverse effects. This approach is supported by the observation that isolated bradycardia is unlikely to adversely affect cerebral oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, there are no data that determine the optimal threshold alarm setting for bradycardia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H731875182\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulse oximetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulse oximeters are used as a frequent adjunct to cardiorespiratory monitors in the NICU. As with bradycardia alarms, they provide an additional safety measure for respiration monitors. Typically, the alarms are set at &lt;85 or &lt;80 oxygen saturation. The incidence and depth of oxygen desaturation episodes after apnea are dependent on pulmonary oxygen stores and baseline level oxygen saturations levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-apnea-of-prematurity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As many preterm infants have low lung volumes associated with residual lung disease and a very compliant chest wall, they are vulnerable to frequent and deep falls in oxygen saturation with relatively short respiratory pauses.

Apnea is classified as central, obstructive, or mixed depending upon the presence of continued inspiratory effort and upper airway obstruction while respiratory airflow is absent. In preterm infants, most apnea spells are classified as either being central or mixed. (See <a href=\"#H372637715\" class=\"local\">'Apnea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of apnea is inversely proportional to gestational age (GA), and almost all extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (GA &lt;28 weeks) are affected. (See <a href=\"#H372637470\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the exact mechanisms underlying apnea of prematurity are unknown, it is thought to be due to disruption of ventilation control processes due to immaturity that results in impaired central respiratory drive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inability to maintain upper airway patency. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apnea of prematurity typically presents within the first few days of life in affected preterm infants who are not mechanically ventilated. It typically resolves before 37 postmenstrual weeks in infants delivered after 28 weeks gestation, but in infants born before 28 weeks, apnea frequently persists until 43 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). (See <a href=\"#H89276472\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of apnea of prematurity is considered when either cessation of breathing greater than 20 seconds or a shorter period of respiratory pause accompanied by oxygen desaturation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia is detected. These events are typically identified by the routine use of cardiorespiratory monitors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulse oximeters for preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Although apnea of prematurity is the most common cause of apnea in preterm infants, it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Other causes of apnea need to be considered and eliminated before the diagnosis of apnea of prematurity is made. (See <a href=\"#H731875161\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H723201127\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of the diagnostic evaluation is to identify any underlying cause (eg, sepsis). The evaluation is based on a comprehensive history and assessment of the infant, and laboratory testing.
