These bands of tissue are called ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86920 \">figure 1</a>). New bone growths form on the ligaments. The new bone growths are called bone spurs.</p><p>Bone spurs can also form in other parts of the body, where ligaments and tendons (strong bands of tissue that connect muscles to bones) attach to bones. This can happen on the ankles, heels, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, or hands.</p><p>Doctors don't know what causes DISH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55209749\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of DISH?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people have no symptoms from their DISH. They find out they have the condition when they have an X-ray done for another reason.</p><p>When people have symptoms from their DISH, the most common ones are pain and stiffness in the upper back. People can also have pain in their neck or other joints, depending on where the bone spurs are.</p><p>Symptoms can also happen when bone spurs press on nearby organs or parts of the body. For example, bone spurs can press on the esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach) and other structures in the neck. This can cause trouble swallowing, hoarseness, or noisy breathing.</p><p>Bone spurs in the lower back can press on the bundle of nerves that run down the back. Pressure on these nerves can cause tingling, pain, numbness, or weakness in the legs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55209764\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for DISH?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. To check for bone spurs, he or she will order X-rays of your back or other parts of your body. Some people have an imaging test called a CT scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55209779\"><span class=\"h1\">How is DISH treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no cure for DISH, but different treatments can help reduce pain and stiffness. Treatment usually involves one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy &ndash; A physical therapist (exercise expert) will teach you exercises and stretches that can help stretch your joints and ease stiffness. He or she can also show you ways to do your daily activities so they don't cause as much pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heat &ndash; Heat, especially in the morning, can help reduce pain and stiffness. Do not use heat for longer than 20 minutes at a time. Also, do not use anything too hot that could burn your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain-relieving medicines &ndash; You can take a pain-relieving medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shots of steroid medicines into the affected joint &ndash; These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. These steroids help reduce pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special shoe inserts (called orthotics) &ndash; These can help with walking if you have painful bone spurs on your heels.</p><p/><p>In rare cases, people with DISH are treated with surgery to remove bone spurs. Surgery is done only when the bone spurs cause serious problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60085486\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. One of the most important things you can do to feel better is to stay as active as possible. You might want to avoid being active because you are in pain. But this can make your muscles weak and your joints stiffer than they already are.</p><p>Find physical activities you like to do. If you have not been active for a while, start by doing just a few minutes of activity a few times a week. Then slowly do more. Ask your doctor, nurse, or physical therapist if you need help starting an exercise program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56054046\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neck pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dysphagia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dysphagia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Neck pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
