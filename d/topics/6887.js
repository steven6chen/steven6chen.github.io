It has been estimated that approximately 12 percent of all mortality in the United States is related to the lack of regular physical activity and that physical inactivity is associated with at least a twofold increase in the risk for coronary events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The public has become well aware of this relationship and millions of Americans have embarked on voluntary exercise programs based upon the assumption that exercise will lead to effective prevention of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The medical profession supports the concept through recommendation of regular physical exercise both as a primary and as a secondary measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The role of both exercise and fitness in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) will be reviewed here. An overview of the benefits and risks associated with exercise is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The benefits and risks of exercise&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of the evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the enthusiasm, the evidence from clinical trials to establish the benefit of exercise is inadequate. There are several reasons for this limitation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Successful, randomized clinical trials require good adherence in order to show a difference between the groups at the end of the study. In the case of exercise, it is not possible from an ethical or practical standpoint to prevent those assigned to the control group from engaging in exercise (drop-ins).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term adherence in the group assigned to exercise is plagued with noncompliance (drop-outs). After several years, the level of exercise might be similar in both groups, thereby preventing any evaluation of the value of exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The randomized trials that have been carried out have generally had small numbers of patients and have been inconclusive with regard to the benefits of exercise on hard end points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Much of the evidence for the benefit of exercise comes from long-term observational studies showing that those who exercise regularly have significantly less CHD and a reduced risk of primary cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. When compared to the least active individuals, the most active individuals had a 30 to 40 percent lower risk of developing CHD or CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This inverse association between amount of exercise and risk of CHD or CVD appears to be consistent regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, this type of evidence, which is summarized below, is subject to bias, since the decision to exercise is only one of the many choices made in adopting a healthy life style. As examples, a heart healthy diet, abstinence from cigarette smoking, and regular medical care may contribute to the improved health of those who also get regular exercise. Thus, attribution of exercise as a prevention of CHD is confounded by other favorable reductions in risk characteristics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite these limitations, regular exercise can be justified on its own merits. Improvements in cardiovascular and general physical fitness and an overall enhancement in the quality of life are ample reasons to embrace physical exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, exercise has beneficial effects on weight control and several other important cardiovascular risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50956\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50956 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise in the treatment and prevention of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment and possible prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus &ndash; Exercise training programs increase activity of mitochondrial enzymes, leading to improved muscle energetics, decreased insulin resistance, and a lower rate of progression to overt type 2 diabetes. In addition, exercise (eg, brisk walking) also has a cardiovascular benefit similar to that seen for secondary prevention in nondiabetics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-exercise-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of exercise in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H2741514022\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Exercise'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in inflammation &ndash; There is increasing evidence that inflammation, as manifested in part by elevations in serum C-reactive protein, plays an important role in atherosclerosis. Regular exercise reduces the atherogenic activity of blood mononuclear cells, with a decrease in the production of atherogenic cytokines and an increase in atheroprotective cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

As an example, there is a transient increase in the risk of sudden death among healthy subjects associated with an episode of vigorous exercise. However, the absolute risk of sudden death during any particular episode of exercise is low (1 per 1.51 million episodes of exercise in the Physicians' Health Study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and habitual exercise diminishes the risk of sudden death. The potential risks and noncardiac benefits of exercise are discussed separately.

Although most observations were made in men, a similar cardiovascular benefit from exercise and fitness has been found in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/14,15,24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,24-28</a>], across different ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/25,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,34</a>], in older adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], and in different countries around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/34,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Relation to exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall benefit of exercise on the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) was demonstrated in a report from the INTERHEART study of patients from 52 countries; regular physical activity was associated with an odds ratio for first MI of 0.86 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Lack of such activity accounted for 12 percent of the population-attributable risk. The beneficial effect of exercise was noted in men and women, in older and younger individuals, and in all regions of the world.</p><p>The range of findings on the beneficial effects of exercise in different groups can be illustrated the following observations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical activity habits were analyzed in 10,269 Harvard alumni (mean age 58) in a retrospective study over 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Those men who engaged in moderately vigorous sports activity (defined as total physical activity levels &gt;4200 <span class=\"nowrap\">kJ/week</span> or brisk walking, recreational cycling or swimming, home repair, and yard work for 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/day</span> on most days) had a 23 percent lower risk of death than those who were less active. The improvement in survival with exercise was equivalent and additive to other lifestyle measures such as cessation of smoking, control of hypertension, and avoidance of obesity. This reduction in risk was also seen in men with multiple coronary risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Regular walking also appears to be beneficial in older men. This was illustrated in a report from the Honolulu Heart Program of 707 retired nonsmoking men (mean age 69) who were capable of participating in a low-intensity activity on a daily basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The distance walked was measured at baseline and mortality data then collected over a 12-year period. After adjustment for age, men who walked more than two miles per day (range 2 to 8 miles [3.2 to 12.8 km]) had a significantly lower mortality rate than those who walked less the one mile (1.6 km) per day (23.8 versus 40.5 percent, risk factor adjusted relative risk 1.8).</p><p>The individual's perception of the intensity of physical activity also appears to affect risk. In a review of 7337 men (mean age 66 years) who were followed for a mean of 5.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], the men who perceived their exercise intensity as moderate or strong had a significant reduction in their adjusted risk of CHD compared to those who perceived their exercise intensity as weak or less intense (relative risk 0.66 to 0.72). This relationship applied even to men who were not fulfilling the current recommendations for exercise intensity and duration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Nurses' Health Study of 72,488 women between 40 and 65 years of age found that brisk walking or vigorous exercise was inversely related to the risk of a coronary event; in a multivariate analysis, women in increasing quintile groups for energy expenditure had age-adjusted relative risks for coronary events of 0.88, 0.81, 0.74, and 0.66, indicating a graded benefit from exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Sedentary women who became active in mid-life or later had a lower incidence of coronary events compared to those who remained inactive.</p><p>Virtually identical findings were noted in a review of over 70,000 postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study in which prolonged sitting predicted an increase in cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Healthy women also benefit from light to moderate exercise; the benefit is again related to the duration of exercise. This was demonstrated in a review of almost 40,000 healthy women (mean age 54) in the Women's Health Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. With a multivariate analysis, the relative risk of CHD for walking 1 to 59 minutes, 1 to 1.5 hours, and 2 or more hours per week was 0.86, 0.49, and 0.48, respectively; there was no association with walking pace.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Twins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Finnish Twin Cohort study of almost 8000 same sex twin pairs found an odds ratio for death of 0.66 in occasional exercisers and 0.44 in conditioning exercisers compared with their sedentary twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

This was confirmed in a population-based cohort study of over 5000 men and women 18 to 30 years of age, which demonstrated a relationship between fitness and the development of cardiovascular risk factors at 15 year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During follow-up, new onset diabetes, hypertension, and the metabolic syndrome developed at a rate of 0.3, 1.3, and 1.0 percent per year, respectively. Individuals with low fitness (&lt;20th percentile) were three to six fold more likely to develop diabetes, hypertension, and the metabolic syndrome than individuals with high fitness (&ge;60th percentile). The level of fitness was less clearly related to the development of hypercholesterolemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost 2500 subjects repeated the exercise test at seven years.

A possible alternative is performance on a long-distance corridor walk. This was assessed in a study of 3075 community-dwelling adults who were 70 to 79 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The patients were instructed to walk 400 m (about one-quarter mile) with encouragement at each lap. At a mean of 4.9 years, participants who failed to complete the walk were at significantly greater risk for developing mobility limitation and mobility disability, with a trend toward increased mortality. Among those who completed the test, each additional minute required was associated with significant increases in mortality and incident cardiovascular disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.29 and 1.20, respectively) as well as mobility limitation and disability. The adjusted hazard ratio for death was 3.63 in the lowest compared to best quartile of functional capacity (&gt;362 versus &lt;290 seconds).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The metabolic syndrome is a high risk phenotype associated with impaired glycemic control (due to insulin resistance), hypertension, dyslipidemia, and abdominal obesity.

At a mean follow-up of 5.7 years, the metabolic syndrome developed in 15 percent of the men and 3.8 percent of the women.

In the NAVIGATOR trial of 9306 persons with impaired glucose tolerance who also had either known CVD or at least one other risk factor for CVD, higher levels of baseline ambulatory activity (hazard ratio 0.90 per 2000 steps of baseline daily activity; 95% CI 0.84-0.96) as well as increases in ambulatory activity during the trial (hazard ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.86-0.99) were both inversely associated with risk of CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the frequency of false-positive tests, the role of exercise testing in screening asymptomatic individuals has been controversial.
