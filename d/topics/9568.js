It happens in people who fly across several time zones, especially when they fly east. The more time zones a person crosses, the more likely he or she is to get jet lag.</p><p>Jet lag gets better on its own as a person adjusts to the new time zone. But this can take several days. The farther from home a person is, the longer it takes to get over jet lag.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93838221\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of jet lag?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep problems, such as problems falling or staying asleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired or sleepy in the daytime</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having trouble thinking, concentrating, or doing normal activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach problems, such as constipation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick or having less energy than normal</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93838236\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you think you had jet lag in the past, talk to your doctor or nurse before going on a long airline flight. He or she can help you figure out ways to avoid jet lag.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93838251\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I prevent jet lag?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Here are a few things you can try:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay awake and sleep at certain times. This can help your body adjust to the new time zone. For example, you can:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stay up until it's dark if you fly west &ndash; Only go to sleep when it gets dark. If you go sightseeing, try to do it during the day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid bright morning light if you fly east &ndash; Go outside as much as possible in the afternoon. If you go sightseeing outdoors, try to do it in the afternoon until your body adjusts to the new time zone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat meals at mealtime in the new time zone &ndash; For example, if you normally eat lunch at noon, eat at noon in the new time zone (not noon at home).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get some exercise, but not right before you are supposed to go to sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93838266\"><span class=\"h1\">Can supplements or medicines help with jet lag?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. A supplement called &quot;melatonin&quot; can help with sleep problems from jet lag when you fly east. Melatonin is a hormone that is naturally made by a gland in the brain. Taking extra melatonin can help your body adjust to a new time zone. You can buy melatonin pills in a store or pharmacy without a prescription. The usual dose is 5 milligrams after dark each night, about half an hour before you want to go to sleep.</p><p>If you want to try melatonin, tell your doctor or nurse. He or she can tell you if it is safe for you. If you take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> (brand names: Coumadin, Jantoven) or medicine to help with epilepsy, melatonin might not be safe for you. Tell your doctor or nurse about all medicines and supplements you take, including over-the-counter medicines.</p><p>You should start taking melatonin the night you arrive, at bedtime (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86167\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86167 \">table 1</a>). You can take melatonin for up to 5 nights in the new time zone. After that, you are not likely to need it.</p><p>Only adults should take melatonin. Doctors don't know if it helps with jet lag in children. Avoid drinking alcohol while you are taking melatonin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93838298\"><span class=\"h1\">Does melatonin cause side effects?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people have side effects from melatonin. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sleepy in the daytime</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness or confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite, nausea, and other stomach problems</p><p/><p>But these side effects are very similar to jet lag. So doctors are not sure if they are really side effects of melatonin or just jet lag symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93838315\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=daytime-sleepiness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Daytime sleepiness (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insomnia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=staying-healthy-when-you-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Staying healthy when you travel (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Insomnia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insomnia-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Insomnia treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
