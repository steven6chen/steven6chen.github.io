SIDS is the leading cause of death in infants between one month and one year of age in the United States. SIDS probably has more than one cause, although the final process appears to be similar in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical management of an SUID including SIDS is discussed in this topic review. Mechanisms, risk factors, and measures to reduce the risk of SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden infant death syndrome: Risk factors and risk reduction strategies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24299863\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID) can be subdivided into explained SUID and unexplained SUID: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unexplained SUID</strong> includes those deaths considered to be sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) by the medical examiner. SIDS is defined as the sudden death of an infant younger than one year of age, which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Unexplained SUID also includes some cases that are not considered SIDS, but lack a clear explanation due to uncertain circumstances. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Explained SUID</strong> includes deaths for which the medical examiner determines that there is a specific cause, including deaths caused by fatal child abuse or underlying medical disorders including metabolic disease. It also includes deaths that are deemed to be caused by accidental suffocation or entrapment during sleep. (See <a href=\"#H13236291\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>These definitions emphasize the necessity of death scene investigation, autopsy, and review of the clinical history when making the diagnosis of SIDS to exclude other causes of the SUID. Nonetheless, the distinction between unexplained SUID and explained SUID is not always clear, and there is inconsistency and local variation in case examinations and diagnostic terminology used by medical examiners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Moreover, SIDS has similar risk factors to other sleep-related infant deaths, including those attributed to suffocation, asphyxia, and entrapment. Therefore, SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths are now addressed together in recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Abnormal metabolites accumulate in the body tissues and can be identified in the liver, urine, or other body fluids.

Cumulative incident stress can create negative consequences at work, home, and in relationships. Emergency responders should be encouraged to participate in the critical incident debriefing process (CISD). CISD supports the healthy resolution of this tragedy and creates opportunities to reduce and manage effects of cumulative stress among emergency responders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18994668\"><span class=\"h2\">Responding to a death in day care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency responders are also called to a family day care home or center-based day care when an infant is found unresponsive. While the numbers of infants who die in day care are small, the setting presents unique challenges for the responder. In addition to the unresponsive infant, there are other children who may have witnessed chaos and confusion in the day care environment. They may have heard and seen sirens and lights and multiple people arriving in the home. The care provider may not be able to accompany the infant to the hospital in order to stay with the other children in <span class=\"nowrap\">her/his</span> care. The day care provider must contact parents of the child to notify them of the emergency and inform them of which hospital to go to. They also need to notify parents of the other children in the day care program, and report the death to their day care licensing agency. Providers will be investigated by both law enforcement and by their state-licensing agency.</p><p>At a later time, the emergency responder can return to the day care setting to talk with children who were present during the emergency to assure them that the responder was there to help. This approach has been useful in reassuring children and reducing their fear of emergency professionals and emergency vehicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18994676\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospital emergency department intervention</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3810165\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical care and data collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When an infant or young child presents in the hospital emergency department (ED) in a lifeless or near-lifeless condition, the child is evaluated and emergency life-saving care provided if appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management/abstract/1,38,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,38,42</a>].

The parents should be allowed to be present during resuscitation if they wish. Otherwise, a private space for families should be provided and a medical staff member should consistently inform them of their child's condition. Once the child is pronounced dead, the attending physician should inform parents of the child's death. ED staff then notifies the medical <span class=\"nowrap\">examiner/coroner</span> and the child's healthcare provider. Family members should be given explanations regarding the rationale for and timing of an autopsy and death scene investigation, and should be told where their child will be transported for autopsy. It may be helpful to explain that an autopsy is a medical procedure similar to surgery, that it is performed in a respectful manner, and that it will help to eliminate or confirm any unsuspected illness or congenital anomaly (&quot;birth defect&quot;) as a cause of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Hospital staff should offer to notify other family members, spiritual advisors, social services, or other supportive individuals as identified by parents. Mementoes or keepsakes, such as footprints, handprints, a lock of hair, photograph, or hospital bracelet, can be prepared and offered to the family. These physical reminders of the child are often comforting to parents because they give them something tangible to look at, hold, and touch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>ED personnel should be prepared for difficult situations including extremes in the parents' behavior, including screaming, collapsing, or expressing no emotion.

SIDS is defined as the sudden death of an infant less than one year of age, which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history. It is the leading cause of mortality in infants between one month and one year of age in the United States. (See <a href=\"#H24299863\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The appropriate professional response to the death of any infant is compassionate, empathic, supportive, and nonaccusatory. At the same time, it is essential to discover the cause of death, if possible.
