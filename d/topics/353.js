It is the most common urologic emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In men, AUR is most often secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); AUR is rare in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis and etiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, diagnosis, acute management, and subsequent evaluation and management of AUR.

The incidence increases with age, occurring most frequently in men over age 60 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. It is estimated that, over a five-year period, approximately 10 percent of men over the age of 70 and almost one-third of men in their 80s will develop AUR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/2,3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6</a>].</p><p>By contrast, AUR is rare in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is estimated that there are three cases of AUR per 100,000 women per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The female to male incidence rate ratio is 1:13.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73272500\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of pathophysiologic mechanisms may be responsible for the development of acute urinary retention (AUR). These mechanisms may overlap within any specific etiology.</p><p>Three factors predominate the pathophysiologic mechanisms of AUR: outflow obstruction, neurologic impairment, and an inefficient detrusor muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Outflow obstruction</strong> &ndash; The flow of urine is impeded with outflow obstruction by mechanical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dynamic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Mechanical obstruction refers to a physical narrowing of the urethral channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Dynamic obstruction refers to increased muscle tone within and around the urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic impairment</strong> &ndash; AUR may develop secondary to the interruption of the sensory or motor nerve supply to the detrusor muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. AUR may be related to incomplete relaxation of the urinary sphincter mechanism (dyssynergia), which can result in elevations in both voiding pressures and post-void residual volumes. In other patients, inefficient bladder (detrusor) muscle contraction is the overriding factor leading to urinary retention. Patients with neurologic impairment may develop acute-on-chronic urinary retention or urinary retention can develop acutely with acute spinal injury (infarction, demyelination) along with other neurologic deficits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-complications-of-spinal-cord-injury-and-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease&quot;, section on 'Urinary complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inefficient detrusor muscle</strong> &ndash; AUR may occur in patients with an inefficient detrusor muscle when a precipitating event results in an acute distended bladder (eg, with a fluid challenge, during general or epidural analgesia without an indwelling catheter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/9,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12-15</a>].

In men with BPH, risk factors for developing AUR include advanced age, severity of lower urinary tract symptoms, increased prostate volume, decreased urinary flow rate, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &gt;2.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other causes of outflow obstruction in men include constipation, cancer (prostate or bladder), urethral stricture, urolithiasis, phimosis, or paraphimosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>].

Patients taking opioids and anticholinergic medications are at higher risk for AUR due to decreased bladder sensation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/1,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29</a>]. Anticholinergic medications also reduce detrusor contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Nasal decongestants that contain sympathomimetic agents increase smooth muscle tone in the region of the bladder neck.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic impairment</strong> &ndash; AUR can occur with spinal cord injuries from trauma, infarct or demyelination, epidural abscess and epidural metastasis, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, diabetic neuropathy, and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. AUR is typically accompanied by back pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other neurologic deficits.

For example, an acutely inflamed prostate gland from acute prostatitis can cause AUR, particularly in men who already have BPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/16,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,30</a>]. Similarly, a urinary tract infection can cause urethritis and urethral edema resulting in AUR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/1,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Genital herpes may cause AUR both from local inflammation as well as sacral nerve involvement.

It is typically associated with lower abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suprapubic discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Affected patients are often restless and may appear in considerable distress.</p><p>These manifestations may be less pronounced when AUR is superimposed upon chronic urinary retention. Chronic urinary retention is often painless [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Acute-on-chronic urinary retention may present with overflow incontinence. The patients may complain of incontinence rather than the inability to pass urine.</p><p>Patients with AUR are likely to present initially to an emergency department or the office of a primary care clinician. Hospitalized patients may develop AUR, often related to medications or after surgical procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-urinary-retention-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative urinary retention in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-post-anesthetic-care-for-adult-patients#H154735179\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of post-anesthetic care for adult patients&quot;, section on 'Inability to void'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation for acute urinary retention (AUR) should begin with a history and physical exam focusing on factors that help identify an etiology. A urinalysis and culture should be sent on all patients; other labs and studies depend on the patient's presentation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History</strong> &ndash; The patient history should focus on previous history of retention or lower urinary tract symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57680\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57680 \">table 2</a>), prostate disease (hyperplasia or cancer), pelvic or prostate surgery, radiation, or pelvic trauma. The patient should also be asked about the presence of hematuria, dysuria, fever, low back pain, neurologic symptoms, or rash. Finally, a complete list of medications (including over the counter medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75763 \">table 1</a>)) should be obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Younger patient age, a history of cancer or intravenous drug abuse, and the presence of back pain or neurologic symptoms suggest the possibility of spinal cord injury or compression. However, patients with spinal pathology generally do not present primarily with AUR. These patients will most often have other signs and symptoms of spinal cord pathology, with AUR being one part of the clinical picture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-epidural-abscess#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal epidural abscess&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical examination</strong> &ndash; In patients with AUR of unknown etiology, the physical examination should include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lower abdominal palpation &ndash; The urinary bladder may be palpable, either on abdominal or rectal examination. Deep suprapubic palpation will provoke discomfort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rectal examination &ndash; A rectal examination should be done in both men and women to evaluate for masses, fecal impaction, perineal sensation, and rectal sphincter tone. A normal prostate examination does not preclude benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as a cause of obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pelvic examination &ndash; Women with urinary retention should have a pelvic examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurologic evaluation &ndash; The neurologic examination should include assessment of strength, sensation, reflexes, and muscle tone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory studies</strong> &ndash; A urine sample should be obtained and sent for urinalysis and urine culture, although the sample may only be available after catheter insertion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The need for other laboratory testing should be determined based upon findings from the patient's history and physical examination. Most patients who present to the emergency department with concern for urinary retention have serum chemistries and creatinine checked. These should be checked in any patient whose history suggests acute-on-chronic urinary retention to evaluate for renal failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other labs that may be helpful include a complete blood count (CBC) for suspected infection. We do not check a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as it is expected to be elevated during an episode of AUR.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19833970\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with suspected acute urinary retention (AUR) will have a bladder ultrasound that will confirm the diagnosis. However, in patients whose history and physical examination strongly suggest a diagnosis of AUR, it is reasonable to proceed with catheterization, which is both diagnostic and therapeutic, and not wait to first obtain a bladder ultrasound.</p><p>A bladder ultrasound that suggests a volume of &ge;300 cc in a patient unable to void suggests urinary retention. However, the bladder ultrasound may be inaccurate due to body habitus, tissue edema, or prior surgery and scarring. If the patient is in discomfort and unable to void, a urethral catheter should be placed regardless of the estimated volume on bladder ultrasound. The volume of urine drained in the first 10 to 15 minutes should be noted and recorded. If this volume exceeds 400 cc, the catheter is typically left in place. For volumes of 200 to 400 cc, the decision to leave the catheter in place is guided by the clinical scenario; and for volumes less than 200 cc, immediate catheter removal and a voiding trial is appropriate for most patients. Patients with volumes less than 200 cc likely do not have acute urinary retention and the patient should be evaluated for other causes of abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suprapubic discomfort.

Although there is a theoretical risk to placement of a urethral catheter in the setting of acute bacterial prostatitis, these patients may have an attempt at gentle urethral catheterization by an experienced clinician.

A partially obstructing urethral or prostatic scar may be present if the patient has had a prior transurethral procedure (eg, transurethral resection of the prostate), or pelvic trauma or radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-urinary-retention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this case, the obstruction may be bypassed by downsizing the catheter to a 10 or 12 gauge French indwelling catheter. In the absence of prior instrumentation or injury, the more common cause of obstruction would be an enlarged prostate. In this case, a larger catheter (20 or 22 gauge) with a firm coude tip may be needed and may require urologic consultation.

In cases when no urologist or appropriately trained clinician is available and the patient is in distress, bladder distention can be temporarily relieved with suprapubic aspiration via a needle. However, such bladder decompression can make subsequent SP placement more difficult. If an appropriately trained medical professional is available in the near future, needle decompression should be deferred.

We prefer SP catheters in patients who are expected to require long-term bladder drainage. SP catheters prevent bladder neck and urethral dilatation and therefore prevent urinary incontinence due to sphincter dysfunction.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation should begin with a history and physical examination focusing on factors that help identify an etiology. A urinalysis and culture should be sent on all patients; other laboratory studies and additional tests depend on the presentation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients whose history and physical examination suggest AUR, it is reasonable to proceed with urethral catheterization, which is both diagnostic and therapeutic. In others where the diagnosis is less clear, a bladder ultrasound may help establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H19833970\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management of AUR consists of prompt bladder decompression usually with an indwelling urethral catheter. Urethral catheterization is contraindicated in patients who have had recent urologic surgery (eg, radical prostatectomy or urethral reconstruction). A suprapubic catheter may be necessary when obstruction precludes a urethral catheter and is also preferred in patients who are expected to require longer-term catheterization. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients can be managed as outpatients once bladder decompression is accomplished. Hospitalization is indicated for patients with urosepsis, acute renal failure, or obstruction related to malignancy or spinal cord compression.

Ongoing combination treatment is generally necessary to prevent recurrence of AUR.
