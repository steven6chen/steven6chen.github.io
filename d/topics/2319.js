Primary Budd-Chiari syndrome is present when there is obstruction due to a predominantly venous process (thrombosis or phlebitis), whereas secondary Budd-Chiari is present when there is compression or invasion of the hepatic veins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the inferior vena cava by a lesion that originates outside of the vein (eg, a malignancy). </p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome.

By contrast, in Asia, there is a slight predominance of men, with a median age of 45 years at presentation. In the non-Asian countries, pure hepatic vein blockage is more common, whereas in Asia, pure inferior vena cava or combined inferior vena cava and hepatic vein blockage predominate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>In a ten year study of hospital admissions in Italy that included 287 patients with BCS, the incidence rates for males and females were 2.0 and 2.2 per million inhabitants, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Patients with subacute or chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome may be asymptomatic. In such patients, the hepatic venous outflow obstruction is often discovered as part of the evaluation of abnormal liver blood tests or when imaging is obtained for other reasons. (See <a href=\"#H57668758\" class=\"local\">'Categorization'</a> above.)</p><p>Acute liver failure is seen in approximately 5 percent of patients, whereas approximately 20 percent present with acute Budd-Chiari syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-10</a>]. While studies often group patients with subacute and chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome together, it is thought that the subacute presentation accounts for the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Because the presentation of Budd-Chiari syndrome is highly variable, clinicians should consider it in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute liver failure, acute hepatitis, or chronic liver disease.

Patients usually present with severe right upper quadrant pain and hepatomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Jaundice and ascites may not be apparent initially but often develop rapidly. Variceal bleeding may also occur. </p><p>Among patients with an acute presentation, liver blood tests are abnormal although the magnitude and pattern of abnormalities can vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Elevation of serum aminotransferases occurs because vascular congestion results in ischemic hepatocellular damage. Serum aminotransferase concentrations can range from 100 to 200 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> to more than 600 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span>. The serum alkaline phosphatase in acute Budd-Chiari syndrome is often in the range of 300 to 400 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/L</span> and serum bilirubin levels are usually less than 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> at the time of presentation, though they may subsequently increase. </p><p>Ascitic fluid in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome has a high serum-to-ascites protein gradient (&gt;1.1), reflecting elevated portal pressures. The protein concentration is variable (ranging from 1.5 to 4.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in one report) and is directly related to the serum protein and inversely related to portal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

It is estimated that 15 to 20 percent of patients are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients who are asymptomatic often have large hepatic vein collaterals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>In subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome, symptoms develop over the course of months. Patients may report a history of vague discomfort in the mid epigastrium or right upper quadrant. Ascites and hepatic necrosis may be minimal due to decompression of the sinusoids by portal and hepatic venous collaterals. However, ascites and lower extremity edema may occur because chronic occlusion of the hepatic veins may be associated with hypertrophy of the caudate lobe of the liver, which receives a separate blood supply from the rest of the liver. The hypertrophied caudate lobe can eventually cause compression of the intrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava, leading to further outflow obstruction and portal hypertension. Venous collaterals may be seen on the anterior abdominal wall.</p><p>In chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome, symptoms develop once the patient has cirrhosis. Patients who develop cirrhosis may have stigmata of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata and palmar erythema. They may also have signs of portal hypertension such as ascites (which may be massive) and esophageal varices. Hepatomegaly and abdominal pain are also common, but encephalopathy is not. Hepatopulmonary syndrome has been described in up to 28 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

However, hyperbilirubinemia resulting in jaundice is rare. They may also have hypoalbuminemia. As in patients with acute Budd-Chiari syndrome, ascitic fluid in patients with subacute or chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome has a high serum-to-ascites protein gradient (&gt;1.1). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome can usually be established with Doppler ultrasonography. Patients should also undergo an evaluation for conditions that may have predisposed to the development of Budd-Chiari syndrome such as prothrombotic disorders.

Among patients with acute liver failure, the presence of hepatomegaly, right upper quadrant pain, and ascites should increase the suspicion for Budd-Chiari syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-the-budd-chiari-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of the Budd-Chiari syndrome&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79562188\"><span class=\"h2\">Establishing the diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79562835\"><span class=\"h3\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome can usually be established noninvasively with Doppler ultrasonography. The portal and splenic circulation should also be evaluated to exclude concurrent portal or splenic vein thrombosis. </p><p>Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis, to aid with treatment planning, or if an experienced Doppler sonographer is not available. In addition, CT or MRI can be performed in patients with an unremarkable ultrasound examination but in whom the suspicion for Budd-Chiari syndrome is high (eg, a patient with a thrombophilic disorder and acute hepatitis whose evaluation for other causes of hepatitis is negative). Venography should be performed if noninvasive tests are negative or nondiagnostic, but there is still strong clinical suspicion for the disease. In addition, venography can be used to confirm the diagnosis and to plan therapeutic interventions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-resonance-imaging-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic resonance imaging of the hepatobiliary tract&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budd-chiari-syndrome-management#H79563629\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Budd-Chiari syndrome: Management&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.) </p><p>Doppler ultrasonography is also used to confirm the diagnosis if a patient's initial imaging study is a CT scan or MRI that suggests Budd-Chiari syndrome. </p><p>Liver biopsy is generally not required to diagnose Budd-Chiari syndrome. In addition, it should be kept in mind that patients are at risk of bleeding from the biopsy site, particularly if started on anticoagulation, which is a primary element of the treatment for Budd-Chiari syndrome.

In addition, Doppler ultrasonography is widely available and does not require contrast administration or exposure to radiation. Nonspecific ultrasonographic findings include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, intra-abdominal collaterals, caudate lobe hypertrophy, atrophy of other hepatic lobes, and compression or narrowing of the inferior vena cava. </p><p>Findings that are more specific for hepatic venous outflow obstruction include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to visualize the junction of the major hepatic veins with the inferior vena cava</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thickening, irregularity, stenosis, or dilation of the walls of the hepatic veins</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A spider-web appearance in the vicinity of the hepatic vein ostia coupled with the absence of a normal hepatic vein</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hyperechoic cord replacing a normal vein</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal flow patterns seen on Doppler imaging, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A large hepatic vein that appears void of flow-signal or has reversed or turbulent flow</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Large intrahepatic or subcapsular collaterals with continuous flow connecting the hepatic veins or the diaphragmatic or intercostal veins</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A hepatic wave form that is flat or lacks fluttering</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Cross-sectional imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT scanning may reveal the same nonspecific abnormalities seen during ultrasonography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77769\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77769 \">image 1</a>). More specific findings on CT scan that suggest Budd-Chiari syndrome include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed or absent filling of the three major hepatic veins (which are usually visible within 40 to 60 seconds after rapid intravenous contrast).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A patchy, flea-bitten appearance of the liver due to increased central contrast enhancement relative to the periphery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid clearance of contrast from the caudate lobe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrowing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lack of opacification of the inferior vena cava.</p><p/><p>While more recent studies are lacking, studies using older CT technology have reported false-positive or indeterminate results in half of patients undergoing CT examination for Budd-Chiari syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>MRI is also useful in the diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In addition to the nonspecific findings described above, the absence or reduction in caliber of hepatic veins and the typical distorted &quot;comma-shaped&quot; intrahepatic collaterals are easily demonstrable. A newer approach, three-dimensional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography, is proving to be helpful for diagnosing pathology of the vena cava, including Budd-Chiari syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, it is not yet widely available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h4\">Sulfur-colloid scintigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sulfur-colloid scintigraphy can also suggest the diagnosis. Although frequently performed in the past, it has generally been replaced by ultrasonography and cross-sectional imaging. Hypertrophy of the caudate lobe associated with Budd-Chiari syndrome is demonstrated by its preferential uptake of the radionuclide. However, more than half of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome do not demonstrate this pattern, probably due to the variable extent of the thrombotic process in the hepatic veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h4\">Venography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gold standard for diagnosing Budd-Chiari syndrome is venography, which is performed by accessing the hepatic venous circulation percutaneously via the internal jugular vein, cephalic vein, or femoral vein. Venography should be performed if noninvasive tests are negative or nondiagnostic, but there is strong clinical suspicion for the disease. It can also be used to direct subsequent therapy by clearly defining which vessels are involved. </p><p>The examination should include venous pressure measurements above and below the entrance of the hepatic veins into the inferior vena cava to determine whether a significant pressure gradient exists. Once the inferior vena cava has been shown to be patent, opacification of each of the individual hepatic veins should be attempted. However, venography of some or all of the hepatic veins may not be feasible in many patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome. Injection of contrast following balloon occlusion of a specific hepatic vein may facilitate its visualization and also demonstrate the so-called &quot;spider-web&quot; pattern characteristic of the Budd-Chiari syndrome. This pattern depicts the attempt of the liver to form venous collaterals to bypass the occluded hepatic veins.</p><p>Venography can be critical for directing therapy. Noninvasive studies may not accurately define the extent or characteristics of the hepatic venous flow. In particular, compression or occlusion of the intrahepatic vena cava leads to sluggish flow in hepatic veins. As a result, hepatic veins that are patent and amenable to therapy may be undetectable on Doppler imaging. MRI venography can be helpful in better defining the venous anatomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While a liver biopsy may diagnose Budd-Chiari syndrome, particularly in the acute or subacute form of the disease, the diagnosis can usually be made noninvasively. Histologic features of Budd-Chiari syndrome include centrizonal congestion, necrosis, and hemorrhage. Large regenerative nodules, obstructive portal venopathy, and <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrosis/cirrhosis</span> may also be found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The thrombotic process in Budd-Chiari syndrome may not involve all the hepatic veins. Thus, the distribution of the typical pathologic findings may be focal or patchy. As a result, some patients require biopsy of both the right and the left lobes of the liver. A laparoscopic approach may be better suited for this purpose.</p><p>We generally perform a liver biopsy when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is confusion regarding the diagnosis (an uncommon situation given the multitude of available imaging tests).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In selected patients with a subacute presentation, when the presence of cirrhosis is not apparent by noninvasive studies, and the finding of significant <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrosis/cirrhosis</span> or severe centrizonal congestion would indicate that the patient could benefit from transjugular intrahepatic or surgical portosystemic shunting. </p><p/><p>It is not clear if histologic findings at the time of diagnosis help predict survival. In one study, histologic findings did not predict five-year survival, though there was a trend toward decreased survival among those with central vein thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Liver biopsies are often obtained via the transjugular route during performance of hepatic venography since the majority of patients have ascites and will require anticoagulation, which increases the risk of the percutaneous approach.

Because these disorders have similar presentations, testing should be undertaken to rule out other common causes of acute (including acute liver failure), subacute, or chronic liver disease. Of note, signs of right-sided congestive heart failure (such as jugular venous distension) are not characteristic of Budd-Chiari syndrome and suggest an underlying cardiac cause of fluid accumulation. </p><p>The approach to the evaluation of patients with acute or chronic liver disease is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Primary Budd-Chiari syndrome is present when there is obstruction due to a primarily venous process (thrombosis or phlebitis), whereas secondary Budd-Chiari is present when there is compression or invasion of the hepatic veins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the inferior vena cava by a lesion that originates outside of the vein. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome may present with evidence of acute liver failure. More often, they present with acute liver disease (rapid symptom onset without liver failure), subacute liver disease (insidious symptom onset prior to the development of cirrhosis), or chronic liver disease (symptom onset once cirrhosis has developed). Patients with acute liver failure or acute (non-fulminant) liver disease have not yet developed venous collaterals, whereas venous collaterals are seen in patients with subacute and chronic liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H57668758\" class=\"local\">'Categorization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome may include fever, abdominal pain, abdominal distension (from ascites), lower extremity edema, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatic encephalopathy. Patients with subacute or chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome may be asymptomatic. In such patients, the hepatic venous outflow obstruction is often discovered as part of the evaluation of abnormal liver blood tests or when imaging is obtained for other reasons. (See <a href=\"#H57668758\" class=\"local\">'Categorization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the presentation of Budd-Chiari syndrome is highly variable, clinicians should consider it in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with acute liver failure, acute hepatitis, or chronic liver disease, particularly if the patient has known risk factors for Budd-Chiari syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79884 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H79562169\" class=\"local\">'When to consider Budd-Chiari syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome can usually be established noninvasively with Doppler ultrasonography. The portal and splenic circulation should also be evaluated to exclude concurrent thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis, to aid with treatment planning, or if an experienced Doppler sonographer is not available. In addition, CT or MRI can be performed in patients with an unremarkable ultrasound examination but in whom the suspicion for Budd-Chiari syndrome is high. Venography should be performed if noninvasive tests are negative or nondiagnostic, but there is strong clinical suspicion for the disease. In addition, venography can be used to confirm the diagnosis and to plan therapeutic interventions. Liver biopsy is generally not required to diagnose Budd-Chiari syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H79562835\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An underlying disorder can be identified in over 80 percent of patients with the Budd-Chiari syndrome, so once Budd-Chiari syndrome is diagnosed, patients should undergo an evaluation for predisposing conditions.
