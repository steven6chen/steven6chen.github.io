Latent infection refers to organisms residing in a suppressed state in the recipient or in the donor tissue. Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, <em>Strongyloides stercoralis</em>, and <em>Trypanosoma cruzi</em> are examples of organisms that can exist in the normal host and are, in general, controlled by the host immune system. The risk for reactivation (replication) of any latent infection is related to the nature and intensity of the immune suppression following transplantation.</p><p>Colonization with pathogens that may be resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents is common in patients with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple prior hospitalizations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple exposures to broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystic fibrosis or other forms of chronic lung disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiomyopathy with heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cirrhosis often with ascites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those awaiting organ replacement with chronic organ dysfunction</p><p/><p>Colonizing organisms may include <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em> species, <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em>, <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em>, methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. These organisms are potential pathogens in the setting of immune suppression or acutely in the postoperative setting if acquired from the environment via vascular access catheters, endotracheal tubes, or open surgical wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Carbapenem-resistant <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> and other gram-negative bacilli are increasingly common in solid organ transplant recipients. These infections generally result from colonization prior to transplant, notably in intestinal, lung, and liver transplant recipients. The identification of such potential pathogens prior to transplantation allows perioperative prophylaxis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> appropriate antimicrobial therapy (eg, for infections of donor organs) if infection occurs. Infections may reflect complications of transplantation (bleeding, fluid collections) and may manifest well after transplantation. Antimicrobial therapy must be directed according to in vitro susceptibility data and be accompanied by debridement of foci of infections, such as infected hematoma or other fluid collections.</p><p>Established infection is difficult to treat in the immunocompromised transplant recipient. Significant antimicrobial toxicities are common, often due to diminished renal or hepatic function and drug interactions. Every effort must be made to detect and to eliminate any such potential pathogens whenever possible prior to transplantation or to design effective prophylactic strategies to prevent the reemergence of latent infections after transplantation. The pretransplant evaluation is central to the prevention of postoperative infection.</p><p>Infections following solid organ transplantation are discussed in greater detail separately.

The use of immunosuppressive therapies in the pretransplant period can increase the risk of <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>P. carinii</em>) pneumonia, tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or toxoplasmosis in the early posttransplant period. Previously treated malignancies that have an infectious etiology, such as anogenital carcinoma due to papilloma virus or nasopharyngeal carcinoma or Burkitt's lymphoma associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are more likely to relapse after transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory testing for evidence of past infectious exposures or active infections is performed to determine the risk for infection in the transplant recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/1,2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6,7</a>].

HTLV-2, which is endemic in regions including the Caribbean and parts of Asia and Africa, is less clearly associated with these diseases and has been difficult to distinguish serologically from HTLV-1. As a result of the low rate of infection in the United States and poor testing options, mandatory screening for <span class=\"nowrap\">HTLV-1/2</span> was discontinued in the United States in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Rarely, donor-transmitted HTLV-1 infection has been identified with significant adverse outcomes in some individuals. HTLV-1 and -2 may be distinguished from one another using Western blot or nucleic acid testing.

Confirmation of vaccine status for HBV, MMR, HAV, human papillomavirus, and tetanus-diphtheria and pertussis should be obtained. However, many immunocompromised patients are often unable to mount protective immune responses to vaccines. Live virus vaccines should be administered in advance of transplantation as immunosuppression may result in unchecked proliferation of attenuated vaccine strains and is generally avoided in solid organ transplant recipients. For these reasons, it is optimal to immunize patients prior to transplantation. Vaccine recommendations for solid organ transplant candidates and recipients are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing for latent tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of tuberculosis in solid organ transplant recipients is 20 to 74 times higher than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. The vast majority of cases are due to reactivation disease, although transmission via a transplanted organ has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>There are two available tests that can be used to screen for latent TB, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> and the interferon-gamma release assay. Both tests are less sensitive in immunocompromised individuals. The frequency of indeterminate IGRAs is highest in liver transplant candidates. The IGRA is more often positive in renal transplant candidates than is the TST and has a greater association with risk factors for tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>].

Even asymptomatic infections can evolve into overwhelming sepsis following transplantation. As an example, lung transplant candidates with cystic fibrosis will generally be colonized with organisms, such as <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, <em>Staphylococcus</em> <em>aureus</em>, and <em>B. cepacia, </em>that are resistant to antimicrobial agents. Since manipulation of the infected lung tissue during transplantation theoretically could disseminate infection, perioperative bactericidal and fungicidal therapies are employed. <em>B. cenocepacia</em> appears to be a particularly virulent genomovar of <em>B. cepacia</em>. Management of lung transplant candidates and recipients who are colonized with this organism is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation#H1627022308\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial infections following lung transplantation&quot;, section on 'Burkholderia cepacia'</a>.)</p><p>Sterilization is often not feasible for colonized lungs or for hepatic abscesses or bile leaks. Infection must be controlled to the degree possible prior to transplant surgery. The resolution of infection should be documented, including reimaging with interventional sampling to assure drainage and sterilization of infected fluids or repeat respiratory cultures, prior to or at the time of &quot;activation&quot; of the candidate on the transplant waiting list.</p><p>As noted above, patients with an anatomic predisposition to infections, such as cholecystitis, diverticulitis, or recurrent aspiration (in lung transplant recipients), may need preemptive surgery prior to transplantation. Patients with a history of recurrent sinusitis should be evaluated prior to transplantation for sinus infection by computed tomography and by an otolaryngologist, who can obtain culture specimens from deep tissue <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perform a drainage procedure, if needed.</p><p>Whenever possible, all intravenous or urinary catheters should be removed as soon as is possible but certainly discontinued prior to transplantation. Exceptions include hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis catheters in the nonbacteremic patient and intraaortic balloon pumps. However, these should be removed, if possible, at the time of transplantation. In patients with liver failure awaiting transplantation, elective intubation may be performed to prevent aspiration. Sputum specimens should be cultured frequently in these patients. Antimicrobial prophylaxis against spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, generally with a fluoroquinolone agent, is useful in patients with ascites after documentation of negative cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In hepatic transplantation, coverage is generally employed for biliary and bowel flora including enterococci and anaerobic organisms, in addition to antifungal prophylaxis. Generally, antifungal prophylaxis with azole or echinocandin agents is used for patients requiring a Roux-en-Y loop or for pancreas transplant recipients based upon the higher incidence of candidal infection in these hosts. Many centers with a significant rate of infection due to <em>Aspergillus</em> after liver or lung transplantation use perioperative prophylaxis with a lipid formulation of amphotericin B, inhaled amphotericin products, or later generation azoles (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>).

All of these pathogens may cause life-threatening infection in the immunocompromised host. The risk for reactivation of any latent infection is related to the nature and intensity of the immune suppression following transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H58202540\" class=\"local\">'Causes of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colonizing organisms may include <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em> species, <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em>, <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em>, methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and carbapenem-resistant <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>. These organisms are potential pathogens in the setting of immune suppression or acutely in the postoperative setting if acquired from the environment via vascular access catheters, endotracheal tubes, or open surgical wounds. (See <a href=\"#H58202540\" class=\"local\">'Causes of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pretransplant evaluation is central to the prevention of postoperative infection. The clinical evaluation of a patient prior to solid organ transplantation should focus on exposure history, cultures for colonization, serologies for more distant exposures, and administration of vaccines. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed history must uncover exposures to organisms that may be of importance in the immunocompromised host (eg, travel and residence history, pets, occupational and recreational exposures, high-risk behaviors). In addition, a careful review of systems may uncover current occult infection or colonization. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing for evidence of past infectious exposures is performed to detect asymptomatic infection in the transplant candidate. Some tests are suggested for all patients, whereas others are useful in selected patients with epidemiologic risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59792 \">table 1</a>). Serologic testing is used as an indicator of significant past exposures; screening for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, hepatitis viruses, HIV, and toxoplasmosis are used as guides for prophylactic strategies after transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is optimal to immunize patients prior to transplantation. Vaccine recommendations for solid organ transplant candidates and recipients are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis is used to prevent infection in the early posttransplant period. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylaxis of infections in solid organ transplantation&quot;, section on 'Peritransplantation prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1111083204\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Kieren A Marr, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fishman JA.
