The acardiac twin usually has a poorly developed heart, upper body, and head. The pump twin is at risk of heart failure and problems related to preterm birth. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12230825\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TRAP sequence has historically been reported to occur in about 1 percent of monochorionic twin pregnancies and 1 in 35,000 pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These figures are widely cited but based on data available up to 1953. In contemporary obstetrics, the incidence appears to be much higher when factors such as the use of first trimester obstetric ultrasound examination, which detects twin demises early in gestation, and assisted reproductive techniques, which have increased the incidence of twins including monochorionic twins, are accounted for. A 2015 study estimated the incidence of acardiac twins is 2.6 percent of monochorionic twin pregnancies and 1 in 9500 to 11,000 pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6896643\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the normal fetal circulation, blood from the placenta flows through the umbilical vein to the fetus. From there, the ductus venosus shunts 80 percent of the placental blood flow into the inferior vena cava, where it mixes with venous return from the lower extremities and kidneys before entering the right atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 1</a>). Once the blood enters the right atrium, the two sides of the fetal heart act in parallel through intra- and extra-cardiac shunts (foramen ovale, ductus arteriosus) to fill the aorta and provide systemic circulation. The distal aorta terminates in the left and right common iliac arteries, which each divide into internal and external iliac branches. The umbilical arteries carry blood from the internal iliac arteries back to the placenta. </p><p>In TRAP sequence, the pump twin maintains this normal pattern of fetal circulation. In addition, a portion of its cardiac output travels through placental arterial-arterial anastomoses to the umbilical artery and eventually to the systemic circulation of the recipient co-twin, thus creating &quot;reversed&quot; circulation in this twin. This is possible because the acardiac twin lacks a functional heart, whose pumping would normally provide forward flow and high systemic pressure. The presence of arterial-arterial anastomoses allows blood to be pumped from the normal twin to the acardiac twin without passing through a capillary bed. Veno-venous and arterio-venous anastomoses also occur. The presence of placental vascular anastomoses is common in monochorionic twins and alone is not sufficient for the development of TRAP sequence.</p><p>Unequal vascular perfusion from the pump twin results in the evolution of a variety of structural abnormalities in the recipient twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The abnormal circulatory pattern provides perfusion of mixed or medium oxygenated blood from the pump twin to the lower half of the recipient twin via one of its iliac arteries, but poor perfusion of the upper torso and head, which are more distal. Tissue necrosis of the more distal parts of the recipient occlude capillaries, with no mechanism for circulation back into the venous system. The arterial circulation into the lower extremities returns backwards to the bifurcation of the aorta and then forward into the opposite iliac arteries and finally into the cord to return to the pump twin. Venous return from perfused tissues contributes to &quot;growth&quot; of the amorphous upper body mass, as there is no mechanism for return to the pump twin once the inferior vena cava and ductus venosus have occluded. </p><p>The acardiac twin has been classified according to the degree of abnormal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The most common anomaly is acardiac acephalus, in which the fetal thoracic organs and head are absent. Other rarer types are acardius acormus, in which only the fetal head develops; acardius amorphus, consisting of a shapeless mass of tissue with no recognizable human parts; and acardius myelacephalus, in which the head and one or more extremities are partially developed (see <a href=\"#H6896650\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal diagnosis'</a> below). These malformations are for the most part secondary to perfusion inadequacies and the length of time since heart activity stopped in the recipient baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6896650\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TRAP is diagnosed prenatally based on the characteristic ultrasound findings described below. Advances in first trimester ultrasound have enabled diagnosis of TRAP sequence at increasingly earlier gestational ages, as early as 11 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The differential diagnosis of TRAP is a single intrauterine demise of a twin gestation or an anomalous second twin. The diagnosis is confirmed by assessing the flow pattern to the acardiac twin in a monochorionic pregnancy and supported by observation of continued growth of the acardiac twin on serial ultrasound examinations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276279239\"><span class=\"h2\">Findings on ultrasound</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276279346\"><span class=\"h3\">Acardiac twin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TRAP should be suspected in monochorionic twin pregnancies when one fetus appears anatomically normal and the other lacks apparent cardiac structures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53045\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53045 \">image 1</a>). The degree of abnormality in the acardiac twin varies widely, ranging from a fetus with well-developed lower extremities, pelvis, and abdomen to a tissue mass that is not readily recognizable as fetal parts. The cranium may be absent or present with cranial defects, such as anencephaly or holoprosencephaly. In addition, there can be limb defects, anterior abdominal wall defects, and absence of lungs, kidney, spleen, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver. </p><p>The acardiac twin has been classified according to the degree of abnormal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. We do not feel that these phenotypes represent primary defects in the acardiac twin, but rather are secondary effects related to the timing of cardiac arrest and subsequent tissue death, as described above. In addition to the absent or nonfunctioning heart, hallmarks of the acardiac twin include massive edema of the head, trunk, and upper extremities. This edema exceeds that which might be attributable to autolysis and is related to the altered perfusion. </p><p>The umbilical cord contains two vessels in up to 70 percent of acardiac fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276279353\"><span class=\"h3\">Pump twin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pump twin may have signs of high-output cardiac failure: polyhydramnios, cardiomegaly, pericardial and pleural effusions, ascites, and tricuspid regurgitation. The development of cardiac failure in TRAP sequence is related to the ratio of the size of the acardiac twin to that of the pump twin. When this ratio exceeds 0.70 (ie, the calculated weight of the acardiac twin is 70 percent or greater compared to the weight of the pump twin), the risk of congestive heart failure in the pump twin is approximately 30 percent, compared to a risk of 10 percent when the ratio is less than 0.70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276279388\"><span class=\"h2\">Doppler ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler velocimetry is used to definitively diagnose the sequence.

The principal reasons for this high mortality were development of heart failure and preterm birth and its sequelae. In another series, all five expectantly managed fetuses died in utero before 20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Given these risks, which are not eliminated with treatment (see <a href=\"#H12338186\" class=\"local\">'Outcome after in utero therapy'</a> below), some couples may choose pregnancy termination.</p><p>Indicators of poor prognosis include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ratio of weight of the acardiac <span class=\"nowrap\">twin/weight</span> of the pump twin greater than 0.70.

In one study, when the ratio of the weight of the acardiac twin to that of the pump twin exceeded 0.70, the risks of preterm delivery and polyhydramnios were 90 and 40 percent, respectively, versus 75 and 30 percent, respectively, when this ratio was below 0.70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyhydramnios (maximum vertical pocket &ge;8 cm)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac failure in the pump twin may be marked by abnormal Doppler studies including persistent absent or reversed diastolic blood flow in the umbilical artery, pulsatile blood flow in the umbilical vein, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reversed blood flow in the ductus venosus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in relative size of the acardiac twin.

Ultrasound surveillance is increased to two times a week if there is evidence of pre-hydrops (ie, fluid in only one cavity-ascites, pleural effusion). Given the increased risk of preterm birth, antenatal corticosteroid administration generally should be provided to all patients between 23 and 34 weeks of gestation. The timing within this range is based on evidence of preterm labor or impending compromise of the pump twin which might necessitate delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12338024\"><span class=\"h2\">In utero therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For continuing pregnancies with one or more poor prognostic criteria, antenatal intervention, delivery, and expectant management are options. As the acardiac twin is nonviable, treatment for TRAP sequence is focused on improving the outcome for the pump twin. Historically, intervention in pregnancies with TRAP sequence was limited to amnioreduction to decrease polyhydramnios or relief for the pump twin by selective delivery of the acardiac twin via hysterotomy or administration of sclerosing agents (eg, alcohol) into the umbilical cord of the acardiac twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For pregnancies between 18 and 27 weeks of gestation, current treatment modalities target occlusion of the umbilical cord of the acardiac twin and include laser coagulation, bipolar cord coagulation, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which are performed with local anesthesia and conscious sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Fetoscopic cord ligation is an alternative, but is less common. First-trimester intra-fetal laser ablation is technically feasible but had a high loss rate of the pump twin (41.7 percent) in one small study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Before any intervention, the karyotype of the pump twin should be determined. In several acardiac twins, investigators found karyotypes that were different from those of the co-twin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276279640\"><span class=\"h3\">Laser, bipolar, and radiofrequency coagulation/ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We preferentially use intrafetal laser treatment for gestational ages less than 16 weeks. At gestational ages greater than 16 weeks, we use radiofrequency ablation (RFA) because of the higher blood flow rate.</p><p>Laser and bipolar coagulation occlude a portion of the umbilical cord near its placental insertion site. For laser treatment of TRAP sequence, a 2 to 3 mm fetoscope is inserted into the amniotic cavity under ultrasound guidance. Ideally, the fetoscope is inserted into the amniotic sac of the acardiac twin; however, in some circumstances, placental and fetal locations prohibit this approach. In such cases, the dividing membrane is pierced. Under direct visualization, either the arterial-arterial anastomoses or the umbilical cord itself are targeted. A YAG or diode laser provides 20 to 40 watts of energy, which is transmitted via a quartz fiber located in the operating channel of the fetoscope to cause coagulation of the relevant vessels. In some cases, particularly for fetuses of later gestational age, the umbilical cord may be too thick for complete coagulation using this technique. In these cases, a bipolar instrument is used to complete the coagulation by directly targeting the umbilical cord using a 3 mm bipolar cautery forceps. With both techniques, cessation of flow is confirmed by Doppler ultrasound interrogation as the last step of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>RFA is used to coagulate the abdominal wall at the base of the umbilical cord, rather than direct coagulation of the umbilical cord itself. For RFA, a 14 to 17 gauge needle is inserted into the amniotic cavity of the acardiac twin under ultrasound guidance. In contrast to laser and bipolar techniques, the procedure is not performed under direct visualization with a fetoscope, but rather is monitored with ultrasound. The RFA device contains a variable number of tines that are deployed within the fetal abdomen of the acardiac twin, at the umbilical cord insertion site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72423\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72423 \">image 3</a>). Ablation is then performed until either specific impedance or temperatures are reached, depending on the device used. As with the other techniques, cessation of blood flow from the pump twin to the acardiac twin is confirmed by Doppler ultrasound prior to the end of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion-trap-sequence/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12338186\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome after in utero therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcome data are limited to short-term outcomes.

There are no randomized trials comparing currently used procedures.

The median gestational age at delivery in these series ranged from 35 to 38 weeks; three in utero demises were documented.
