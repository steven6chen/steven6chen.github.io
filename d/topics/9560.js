With the near eradication of poliomyelitis, JEV is now the leading cause of childhood viral neurological infection and disability in Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. JEV is closely related to West Nile, St. Louis encephalitis, and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>About 68,000 cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) are estimated to occur each year. JEV is endemic throughout most of Asia and parts of the western Pacific, but local transmission has not been observed in Africa, Europe, or the Americas. For travelers to Asia, the risk of JE is very low but varies based on season, destination, duration, and activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The estimated incidence of JE among travelers to Asia from nonendemic countries is &lt;1 case per 1 million travelers. Risk is likely to be higher for expatriates or travelers with longer duration of travel or whose plans include extensive outdoor activities in rural areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Between 1973 and 2013, 68 cases of JE among travelers or expatriates from nonendemic countries were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Since a JE vaccine became available in the United States in 1993, only eight cases of JE were reported among United States travelers through 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Most human JEV infections are asymptomatic or cause a nonspecific febrile illness. Less than 1 percent of JEV infections results in symptomatic neuroinvasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, when neurological disease does occur, it is usually very severe with a high case-fatality rate; among survivors, neurological sequelae are common. All travelers to JEV-endemic countries should be given advice on measures to prevent JE, and JE should be considered among the differential diagnoses for patients with suspected neurological infection who have returned from recent travel in a JEV-endemic country in Asia or the Western Pacific region.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Japanese encephalitis is endemic throughout most of Asia and parts of the Western Pacific region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52734\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52734 \">figure 1</a>). Within the JE-endemic region, there are two typical patterns of transmission:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In areas with temperate climates (including China, Japan, South Korea, Nepal, northern Vietnam, and northern India), most cases occur over a period of several months when the weather is warmest, usually after the monsoons begin or associated with heavy rainfall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/2,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,9</a>]. The peak months of transmission and the length of the season vary from place to place. There are sometimes large, explosive outbreaks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In areas with tropical climates (including Cambodia, Indonesia, southern Vietnam, and southern Thailand), there is year-round transmission. An increase in cases may be observed during the rainy season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p>In endemic areas, JE typically affects children &lt;15 years of age; by early adulthood, the majority of the population has protective immunity following natural exposure to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) as a result of ongoing environmental transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, when the virus enters new geographic areas where there is no immunity, JE affects both adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In regions where childhood immunization programs have been introduced, the age distribution of disease shifts to older ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. Among immunologically na&iuml;ve travelers visiting JEV-endemic regions, the disease can affect individuals at any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is transmitted in an enzootic cycle involving mosquitoes and vertebrate-amplifying hosts, primarily pigs and wading birds. Humans are incidental and dead-end hosts in the JEV transmission cycle as they do not develop sufficiently high viremia to infect feeding mosquitoes. Therefore, mosquitoes do not transmit the virus directly from one person to another person.</p><p>Mosquitoes of the <em>Culex vishnui</em> subgroup, particularly <em>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</em>, are the major vectors of JEV, although JEV has been isolated from over 30 mosquito species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. <em>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</em> commonly breeds in rice fields, marshes, and other shallow pools of water. It is an evening and nighttime biting mosquito and mainly feeds outdoors, preferentially on large animals and birds and only infrequently on humans.</p><p>Pigs and wading birds, such as herons and egrets, are the most important hosts for maintenance and amplification of JEV. Pigs are a key host as they develop high levels of viremia, and in Asia large numbers of pigs are frequently kept near human dwellings. In addition, the population of susceptible pigs is replenished regularly because of commercial slaughtering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. JEV infection in pigs is usually asymptomatic, but gestational infection can result in abortions and stillbirths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The strong epidemiological link with pigs in the JEV transmission cycle has sometimes led to the misconception that areas without pigs are likely to be free of disease. However, transmission in such areas has also been documented, likely secondary to infection in wading birds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The risk for JEV infection is highest in rural, agricultural areas of Asia, as all the elements of the enzootic transmission cycle are in close proximity to humans. However, Japanese encephalitis cases are occasionally reported from urban or peri-urban areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly recognized clinical presentation of Japanese encephalitis is acute encephalitis. Milder forms of disease such as aseptic meningitis or nonspecific febrile illness with headache also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. After an incubation period of 5 to 15 days, initial symptoms are usually nonspecific and may include fever, diarrhea, and rigors followed by headache, vomiting, and generalized weakness. Over the next few days, mental status changes, focal neurologic deficits (including paresis, hemiplegia, tetraplegia, or cranial nerve palsies), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> movement disorders develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>]. Many patients lapse into coma, and some require ventilatory assistance.</p><p>In some patients, the initial presentation may consist of abnormal behavior or acute psychosis, leading to potential misdiagnosis. For example, during the Korean War in the 1950s, some American soldiers presenting with JE were initially thought to have &quot;war neurosis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Seizures (usually generalized tonic-clonic) are very common, especially among children. In some children, subtle motor seizures occur and may present with twitching of a digit, eye deviation, or irregular breathing. These may be missed without electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A very distinctive clinical presentation of JE is a Parkinsonian syndrome resulting from extrapyramidal involvement; findings include dull, flat, mask-like faces with unblinking eyes, tremor, and cogwheel rigidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In some patients, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection may present with a poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis due to anterior horn cell damage, without any alteration in consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. After a brief febrile illness, paralysis occurs in one or more limbs, usually asymmetric and more common in the lower than upper limbs. In these patients, encephalitis develops subsequently in about 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Clinical signs associated with a poor prognosis include multiple prolonged seizures and raised intracranial pressure. Changes in the respiratory pattern, flexor and extensor posturing, and abnormalities of the pupillary and oculocephalic reflexes are also poor prognostic signs and may reflect brainstem encephalitis with or without transtentorial herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The white blood cell count is moderately elevated in most patients, and hyponatremia may be observed due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Thrombocytopenia, mild anemia, and elevated hepatic enzymes may also occur but are relatively nonspecific laboratory features.</p><p>The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure is elevated in about 50 percent of patients. CSF findings are typically a mild to moderate pleocytosis of 10 to several hundred white blood <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> with lymphocytic predominance, slightly elevated protein, and normal CSF to plasma glucose ratio. Early in disease, there may be no pleocytosis or neutrophils may predominate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) scanning for detecting Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-associated abnormalities such as changes in the thalamus, basal ganglia, midbrain, pons, and medulla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Thalamic lesions are the most commonly described abnormality; although these can be highly specific for JE in the appropriate clinical context, they are not a very sensitive marker of JE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65410\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65410 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Electroencephalogram abnormalities may include theta and delta coma, burst suppression, epileptiform activity, and occasionally alpha coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>JE is diagnosed serologically by detection of JEV-specific immunoglobin (Ig)M antibodies in CSF or serum by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The presence of JEV-specific IgM antibodies in CSF confirms recent central nervous system infection. IgM antibody in serum is suggestive of JE but could indicate asymptomatic infection or recent JEV vaccination.</p><p>On admission to hospital, CSF antibodies are detectable in 70 to 90 percent of JE patients; JEV IgM is detectable in most CSF samples collected five to eight days after symptom onset. On admission to hospital, serum antibodies are detectable in about 60 to 70 percent of patients; serum antibodies are detectable in nearly all serum samples collected at least nine days after symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. If JE is suspected and acute samples are negative, a convalescent serum sample should be collected.</p><p>Important considerations for interpretation of serology results include vaccination history, date of onset of symptoms, and information regarding other flaviviruses known to circulate in the geographical area that may cross-react in serologic assays (such as dengue, Murray Valley encephalitis, or West Nile viruses). As serodiagnosis of flaviviral infections is not straightforward and cross-reactivity is common, samples positive by ELISA should be referred to a reference laboratory for confirmatory plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT).</p><p>Virus isolation or detection of viral RNA with a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) can provide a definitive diagnosis, but positive results from CSF or blood are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/18,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,29,30</a>]. Because humans have low levels of transient viremia and high levels of neutralizing antibodies by the time distinctive clinical symptoms are recognized, virus isolation and NAATs are insensitive for the detection of JEV or JE viral RNA in blood or CSF. JEV isolates have been obtained postmortem from brain tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>United States healthcare providers should contact their state or local health department or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Division of Vector-Borne Diseases in Colorado for assistance with diagnostic testing (telephone: 970-221-6400).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of JE includes other viral encephalitides, other central nervous system infections, para- or post-infectious causes, and noninfectious diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/21,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,31</a>]. Domestic arboviral infections should be considered if the patient could have been exposed to local arboviruses during the incubation period. In the United States, this may include La Crosse, St. Louis encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis, or Powassan viruses, among other arboviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See related topics.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of Japanese encephalitis consists of supportive care with emphasis on control of intracranial pressure, maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion pressure, seizure control, and prevention of secondary complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>There is no specific antiviral treatment for JE. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> in 153 Indian children did not show any difference in outcome between the treatment and control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Corticosteroids and interferon-alfa-2a did not improve outcome in controlled clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Work is ongoing to investigate other potential antiviral agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality among hospitalized patients is about 20 to 30 percent. Some deaths come after a short fulminant course while others occur after a prolonged period of coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Among Japanese encephalitis survivors, long-term sequelae occur in at least 30 to 50 percent. Although the clinical condition of many JE patients improves after hospital discharge, deterioration in the months following acute illness may be observed in about 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The most common sequelae are upper and lower motor neuron weakness and cerebellar and extrapyramidal signs. Severe cognitive or language impairment, psychiatric problems, and recurrent seizures also occur. Among patients who appear to have recovered well, subtle sequelae such as learning or behavioral problems may be observed in about 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>There is limited information on Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection in pregnancy. In India, four miscarriages were reported among nine infected pregnant women; all of the women were in the first or second trimester of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. JEV was isolated from one of the four aborted fetuses, suggesting that intrauterine transmission of JEV can occur.</p><p>Infection with JEV is thought to produce lifelong immunity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites are important to reduce the risk of Japanese encephalitis among travelers to endemic regions. In addition, JE vaccine provides substantial additional protection for travelers to high-risk settings (based on location, duration, season, and activities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Personal protective measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measures include using insect repellent, permethrin-impregnated clothing, staying in screened or air-conditioned rooms, or sleeping under a bed net.

JE-VC was licensed in 2009 for use in individuals &ge;17 years and in 2013 for use in children 2 months through 16 years of age. An inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccine (JE-MB; JE-VAX) was used in the United States for almost 20 years following its licensure in 1992, but it is no longer available.</p><p>Other JE vaccines are manufactured and used in other countries but are not licensed for use in the United States. These include a live-attenuated chimeric virus vaccine, the live-attenuated SA 14-14-2 JE vaccine, inactivated Vero cell culture-derived vaccines, and inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccines. The recommended number of doses and schedule vary by vaccine and country.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2867730\"><span class=\"h3\">Whom to vaccinate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions regarding the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=japanese-encephalitis-virus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine</a> must weigh several factors. JE is a severe disease, there is no specific treatment, and outcome is often poor. However, vaccination is associated with risk of adverse events (as well as expense), and the overall risk of travel-associated JE disease is very low. The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends JE vaccine for travelers who plan to spend a month or longer in endemic areas during the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season. Vaccination should be considered for short-term travelers (&lt;1 month) if they plan to travel outside of an urban area and have an increased risk of JEV exposure. The complete recommendations are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54113\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54113 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347394509\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunogenicity and safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no efficacy data for JE-VC; the vaccine was licensed on the basis of its ability to induce JEV neutralizing antibodies as a surrogate for protection and safety evaluations in approximately 5000 adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

For adults and children &ge;3 years, each dose is 0.5 mL; for children aged 2 months to 2 years of age, each dose is 0.25 mL. For individuals aged &ge;17 years, a booster dose is warranted before potential JE exposure if the primary series of JE-VC was administered &gt;1 year previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Thus far, there are no formal recommendations on booster doses in children. A clinical trial has investigated an accelerated schedule of two doses of JE-VC administered on days 0 and 7, but this schedule has not yet been licensed in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>A severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of JE-VC is a contraindication to subsequent administration. JE-VC contains <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protamine-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">protamine sulfate</a>, which is known to cause hypersensitivity reactions in some individuals; it does not contain gelatin or murine proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The risk of hypersensitivity or neurologic adverse events with JE-VC is probably lower than that with JE-MB, although the possibility of rare adverse events cannot be excluded. Limited data on the use of JE-VC in individuals &ge;65 years suggest safety and immunogenicity are similar to those among younger subjects, but further data are needed. No studies of JE-VC in pregnant women have been conducted. Therefore, administration of JE-VC to pregnant women usually should be deferred. However, pregnant women who must travel to an area where risk for JEV infection is high should be vaccinated when the theoretical risk for immunization is outweighed by the risk for infection.</p><p>Individuals in the United States who have received JE-MB previously and require further vaccination against JEV should receive a two-dose primary series of JE-VC until further data are available on the duration of protection following a single dose of JE-VC in prior recipients of JE-MB. Two studies have investigated the use of JE-VC as a booster dose after a primary series with JE-MB; one study was performed among United States military personnel and the other was conducted at two European travel clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. Both studies demonstrated that, among individuals previously vaccinated with a primary series of JE-MB, a single dose of JE-VC adequately boosted neutralizing antibody levels (measured at four to eight weeks after the booster dose). In the European study, among 19 subjects available for longer-term follow up, 89 to 100 percent had protective neutralizing antibodies against different genotypes of JEV a mean of 2.1 years following the booster dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4033665678\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About 68,000 cases of Japanese encephalitis are estimated to occur each year. However, for travelers, the risk is low. Fewer than 1 percent of JEV infections results in symptomatic neuroinvasive disease. However, when neurological disease does occur, it is usually a very severe disease with a high case-fatality rate and neurological sequelae in 30 to 50 percent of survivors. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In endemic areas, JE typically affects children &lt;15 years of age; by early adulthood, the majority of the population has protective immunity following natural exposure to JEV as a result of ongoing environmental transmission. Among immunologically na&iuml;ve travelers visiting endemic regions, the disease can affect individuals at any age. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>JEV is transmitted in an enzootic cycle involving mosquitoes and vertebrate-amplifying hosts, primarily pigs and wading birds. Humans are incidental and dead-end hosts in the JEV transmission cycle as they do not develop sufficiently high viremia to infect feeding mosquitoes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly recognized clinical presentation of JEV infection is acute encephalitis. Milder forms of disease such as aseptic meningitis or nonspecific febrile illness with headache also occur. Seizures (usually generalized tonic-clonic) are very common, especially among children. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>JE is diagnosed serologically by detection of JEV-specific immunoglobin (Ig)M antibody in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The presence of JEV-specific IgM antibodies in CSF confirms recent central nervous system infection. IgM antibody in serum is suggestive of JE but could indicate asymptomatic infection or recent JE vaccination. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no specific antiviral treatment for JE. Treatment consists of supportive care with emphasis on control of intracranial pressure, maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion pressure, seizure control, and prevention of secondary complications. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precautions to reduce the risk of JE among travelers to endemic regions include personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites. For some travelers who will be in a high-risk setting (based on location, duration, season, and activities), JE vaccine may further reduce the risk of infection. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One JE vaccine is available in the United States: an inactivated Vero cell culture-derived vaccine (JE-VC; IXIARO). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/japanese-encephalitis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Halstead SB, Jacobson J.
