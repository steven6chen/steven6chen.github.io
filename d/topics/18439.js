In addition, uterine perforation and associated complications can result in hemorrhage or sepsis. The risk of uterine perforation is increased by factors that make access to the endometrial cavity difficult (eg, cervical stenosis) or alter the strength of the myometrial wall (eg, pregnancy, lactation, and menopause).</p><p>The prevention, diagnosis, and management of uterine perforation during gynecologic procedures will be reviewed here.

In addition, many perforations are not recognized or confirmed, so it is likely that any reported incidence is an underestimate.</p><p>In most studies, hysteroscopy is complicated by confirmed uterine perforation in approximately 1 percent of operative procedures. There are fewer perforations during diagnostic hysteroscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy#H38\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;, section on 'Uterine perforation'</a>.)</p><p>During dilation and curettage for disorders not related to pregnancy, perforation has been reported in approximately 0.3 percent of premenopausal patients and 2.6 percent in the postmenopausal patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilation-and-curettage#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dilation and curettage&quot;, section on 'Uterine perforation'</a>.)</p><p>For pregnancy-related procedures, the risk of perforation is increased. It is most common when attempting control of postpartum hemorrhage after a third trimester delivery (as high as 5 percent). For both first and second trimester procedures (for induced or spontaneous abortion), the rate of uterine perforation is approximately 0.5 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Uterine perforation'</a>.)</p><p>Endometrial ablation complicated by uterine perforation has been reported in approximately 1 percent of procedures; the rate is higher for endometrial resection (2 percent or higher).

As an example, women with potential cervical stenosis include those who have never had a vaginal delivery and postmenopausal women. Similarly, there is a high risk for abnormalities of the endocervical canal in women who have had surgical procedures involving the cervix including loop electrosurgical excision procedure, cervical conization, and cerclage.

In addition, the ability to manipulate instruments, including dilators, and to angle them appropriately for access to the uterine cavity may be impaired. Pretreatment with vaginal estrogen therapy for one to two weeks before attempting a procedure will make the patient considerably more comfortable and may result in markedly improved access for visualization and sampling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;</a>.) In women for whom estrogen therapy is contraindicated, topical anesthetic cream applied by the patient at home or in the office several minutes prior to the procedure will be helpful in controlling the patient's discomfort and reducing secondary levator spasm. </p><p>Vaginoscopy without speculum insertion can also result in better and more comfortable entry through the cervical canal. To accomplish this without use of a tenaculum will require cervical preparation.

Prior to beginning the procedure, a pelvic bimanual examination should be performed with careful attention to the uterine position to facilitate accurate placement of dilators. In obese women, a rectovaginal examination may be needed to accurately determine if significant flexion of the uterus is present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-gynecologic-history-and-pelvic-examination#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The gynecologic history and pelvic examination&quot;, section on 'Bimanual examination'</a>.)</p><p>Straightening the uterine axis will also facilitate placement of cervical dilators and other instruments through the endocervical canal into the uterus. This can be accomplished by placing a tenaculum on the anterior lip of the cervix and using gentle traction. An intracervical or paracervical block may improve patient experience with difficult dilation in a flexed uterus. Rarely (typically for virginal or extremely anxious patients) regional or general anesthesia may be required. Use of tapered dilators will result in more gentle mechanical dilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pudendal-and-paracervical-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pudendal and paracervical block&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;, section on 'Anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Difficult cervical dilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Difficult cervical dilation can also be approached by using smaller instruments for dilation (eg, lacrimal duct probe or urologic dilators).</p><p>If the cervix cannot be dilated using gentle force, ultrasound guidance may be required to safely dilate the cervix and gain passage into the endometrial cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There are no data evaluating this approach, but we find it useful in our clinical practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dilation-and-curettage#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dilation and curettage&quot;, section on 'Cervical dilation'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, intracervical injection of dilute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> (4 units per 80 mL normal saline) has been reported to facilitate cervical dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although generally well tolerated, vasopressin injection must be performed with caution, since intravascular injection or absorption has been associated with profound hypertension, bradycardia, and intraoperative mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Due to this rare, but serious, complication, vasopressin injection is not recommended in the office setting.

The ability to directly visualize hysteroscopic instruments allows for additional safety measures. As an example, a resectoscopic loop should always be moved towards the operator, and not pushed into the uterine wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Also, energy sources should not be activated unless there is a clear view of the instrument.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIOPERATIVE PRESENTATION OF UTERINE PERFORATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">During the procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine perforation can be diagnosed during the perioperative period by direct visualization during the procedure or based on clinical signs of visceral or vascular injury. In addition, perforation should be suspected when a uterine sound, dilator, or operating instrument passes beyond the expected length of the uterus. The most common site of uterine perforation is the fundus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>].</p><p>Perforation at the fundus is most common and typically leads to minimal bleeding, whereas a lateral uterine perforation may lacerate uterine blood vessels, thus resulting in immediate and profuse hemorrhage and, possibly, a broad ligament hematoma. A low cervical perforation can lacerate the descending branch of the uterine artery, which also can present with delayed cervical bleeding if the artery initially goes into spasm.</p><p>During hysteroscopy, signs of possible injury to the myometrium include excessive bleeding from the uterus, sudden loss of visualization, sudden loss of uterine distension, and an abrupt increase in the distending fluid deficit. Any of these signs should prompt a careful search for perforation.</p><p>Direct visualization of any of the following confirms a uterine perforation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hole in the uterine wall is directly visualized via hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, or laparotomy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Omentum (or other adipose tissue) or bowel is visible through an opening in the myometrium, or is present in the endometrial cavity or in a suction instrument (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69249\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69249 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adipose tissue is identified in a curettage specimen by direct visualization by the surgeon or pathologist. Adipose tissue is present in the peritoneal cavity, but not within the uterus.</p><p/><p>In the absence of direct visualization of an opening or concern based on passage of an instrument beyond the fundal length, uterine perforation should be suspected if there are signs of visceral or vascular injury. These include excessive bleeding, hypotension, or acute onset of hematuria. Occult retroperitoneal or intraabdominal hemorrhage can also occur, with perioperative hypotension the first sign of a complication.</p><p>If a perforation is suspected during the procedure, the procedure should be immediately halted, all instruments removed. The patient should be carefully monitored in the recovery room for deterioration in vital signs or active bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-procedure clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine perforation is generally recognized during the procedure. However, a patient with the following signs or symptoms after an intrauterine procedure should be evaluated for uterine perforation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe or persistent pelvic or abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal distension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy or persistent vaginal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematuria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p>Many women experience mild to moderate cramping for several hours after a uterine procedure. However, severe or persistent abdominal pain is unusual and requires prompt evaluation. One series of 15 women who developed uterine perforations at second trimester dilatation and evacuation reported that unexpected pain was the most prominent sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The pain may be focal or diffuse since its source may be a specific injury to the uterus, bowel, or bladder.</p><p>Bowel may be perforated or become incarcerated in the uterine defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with bowel injuries may not develop symptoms for several hours. Such injuries should be suspected if a patient has abdominal distension or continues to have abdominal pain, especially in the presence of tachycardia. Patients with bowel injury rarely present with rectal bleeding. Unrecognized bowel injury can be rapidly fatal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-tract-perforation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal tract perforation&quot;</a>.) &#160; &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A uterine perforation that is not complicated by bleeding or injury to surrounding structures may require only observation, while a more involved perforation is a surgical emergency.</p><p>If uterine perforation is suspected, the patient should be evaluated with vital signs and a pelvic and abdominal examination. If bleeding is suspected, laboratory evaluation includes a hematocrit and coagulation tests.</p><p>Uterine perforation cannot be confirmed or excluded with any imaging study and thus imaging is not a routine part of the evaluation. In women with signs of hypovolemia without apparent bleeding, a pelvic ultrasound can be used to assess for a broad ligament or retroperitoneal hematoma.</p><p>If there is any concern for ureteral or bladder injury, the integrity of these structures can be easily assessed by the intravenous administration of one of several dyes or by direct visualization. In addition, a catheter or cystoscope can be introduced into the bladder to look for fresh blood from an intravesical hemorrhage or the actual perforation. Cystoscopy is required to visualize the ureteral orifices and assess for bilateral flow.</p><p>If bowel injury is suspected, abdominal exploration is warranted for diagnosis and potential repair. Evaluation of the bowel should be performed by a surgeon experienced in detection of bowel injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with suspected uterine perforation may be managed expectantly or with surgical exploration, depending upon the likelihood of hemorrhage or visceral injury.</p><p>In our practice, we do not give prophylactic antibiotics for women with suspected uterine perforation. We treat with antibiotics only if clinical signs of infection are present (eg, endometritis, peritonitis). No studies have addressed this issue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Candidates for observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If uterine perforation is thought to have occurred during cervical dilation or with a blunt instrument with no suction or electrosurgical energy source, the risk of vascular or visceral injury is low and close observation may be sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. The patient should be monitored for signs of intraperitoneal hemorrhage (eg, hypotension, dropping hematocrit, increasing abdominal distension) or visceral injury (increasing abdominal pain or tenderness, abdominal distension). This may reasonably occur in the recovery room over several hours. A baseline hemoglobin and hematocrit (if not already performed) may be obtained and then repeated in three to four hours. A stable patient may be discharged home with strict instructions to immediately report any increase in pain, fever, abdominal distension, or bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Criteria for surgical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal exploration should be performed immediately if there are signs of severe uterine bleeding or vascular or visceral injury are suspected. As an example, vigorous vaginal bleeding should prompt a pelvic examination to exclude a cervical laceration, followed by abdominal exploration.</p><p>If electrosurgical energy, morcellation, or suction curettage were utilized during the procedure and perforation is suspected, the potential for serious injury is increased. In such patients, immediate abdominal exploration should be performed.</p><p>Any intrauterine device, tubal sterilization device, or other foreign body that has entered the peritoneal cavity should be removed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients who require abdominal exploration, laparoscopy is preferred if the patient is stable since the risks of perioperative morbidity are lower. A meta-analysis of 27 randomized clinical trials comparing operative laparoscopy to laparotomy for benign gynecological conditions found the overall risk of minor complications (eg, fever, wound or urinary tract infection) was significantly lower in women undergoing laparoscopic procedures. In addition, recovery time is shorter after laparoscopy. However, it is difficult to evaluate the entire bowel at laparoscopy and an experienced operative laparoscopist is needed to accomplish both evaluation and repair using laparoscopic instruments (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gynecologic-laparoscopic-surgery-and-non-umbilical-entry-sites#H467390\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gynecologic laparoscopic surgery and non-umbilical entry sites&quot;, section on 'Laparoscopy versus laparotomy'</a>). Consultation with a general surgical colleague is recommended if there is concern for bowel injury &ndash; either electrosurgical or mechanical. General gynecologists may not be sufficiently experienced to undertake this assessment.</p><p>Laparotomy may be warranted in patients who are not hemodynamically stable. Once the abdomen has been entered, initial inspection should include identifying the site of uterine perforation and assessing for injury to adjacent structures.</p><p>The patient should be kept in a stable position to avoid movement of bowel loops away from the area. This is true for evaluation by either laparoscopy or laparotomy. Retaining the &quot;at risk&quot; loops of bowel in the pelvis will facilitate identification of injuries. Hemorrhage into the bowel wall or blanching of the bowel if energy sources were used may reflect bowel injury.</p><p>Areas of brisk bleeding from the uterus or vessels should be controlled immediately. Bleeding from the uterine site can be stemmed using sutures or electrocoagulation. Large perforations (&gt;1 cm) should be reapproximated with suture. Depending on the site and extent of injury, resection of the perforated uterine segment may be necessary for repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Failing these measures, hysterectomy may be needed; selective uterine artery embolization is an alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Consultation with an interventional radiologist, if available in the facility, may be helpful prior to proceeding with hysterectomy in cases of brisk bleeding from the perforation site or for management of active retroperitoneal bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interventional-radiology-in-management-of-gynecological-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interventional radiology in management of gynecological disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Retroperitoneal injury may be difficult to recognize. The surgeon should look carefully for enlarging retroperitoneal hematoma formation.</p><p>If injury to the bowel, bladder, or major vessels has occurred, consultation with a general surgeon, vascular surgeon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a urologist is helpful when determining the extent of, and repairing, the injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Completing the original procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If uterine perforation occurs with a blunt instrument with no suction or electrosurgical energy source, the original procedure can be completed under ultrasound guidance (also without use of suction or an energy source) and the woman can be observed.</p><p>Another option is to complete the procedure under laparoscopic guidance.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-after-gynecologic-surgery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Care after gynecologic surgery (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We see patients for a follow-up visit one week following the procedure to assess for further complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">DELAYED PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine perforation should be suspected in women who have undergone an intrauterine procedure in the preceding three weeks and who present with symptoms of visceral or vascular injury, although such complications can also occur without uterine perforation (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Post-procedure clinical manifestations'</a> above). Some complications, including bowel injury, can present as late as three weeks after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Women with delayed diagnosis of uterine perforation typically present with an associated complication (eg, anemia, peritonitis) and need evaluation for the presenting complication rather than confirmation of the uterine perforation itself. Women who present after an intrauterine procedure with nonspecific abdominal pain with no signs of hemorrhage or visceral injury do not need to be evaluated for uterine perforation, although the possibility of perforation and visceral injury must always be considered when approaching these patients.</p><p>Hemorrhage due to uterine perforation is likely to present perioperatively and, thus, be recognized before the patient leaves the hospital or clinic. This may result from severe injury to the uterine wall or a blood vessel. On the other hand, patients with occult retroperitoneal or intraabdominal bleeding (eg, a slowly expanding retroperitoneal hematoma) may not become symptomatic until several hours after a procedure.</p><p>Visceral perforation can present either acutely or hours to weeks post-procedure. Fever, in particular, is a delayed sign that may result from an infection of the reproductive organs (eg, tubo-ovarian abscess), bowel, or urinary tract (eg, peritonitis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a complication associated with uterine perforation is suspected, the patient should be evaluated with vital signs and a pelvic and abdominal examination. If bleeding is suspected, laboratory evaluation includes a hematocrit and coagulation tests. If peritonitis or urinary tract infection is suspected, a white blood cell count and urine or blood cultures are also collected.</p><p>Uterine perforation cannot be confirmed or excluded with any imaging study. In patients with anemia, fever, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic mass or tenderness, pelvic ultrasound is the test of choice to identify a broad ligament or retroperitoneal hematoma or a tubo-ovarian abscess and can also exclude some other etiologies of pelvic pain.</p><p>If bowel or bladder injury are suspected, appropriate abdominal or urinary tract imaging should be performed. The evaluation of patients with suspected bowel or urinary tract injury is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-genitourinary-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt genitourinary trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Primary evaluation and management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-tract-perforation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal tract perforation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific complications should be treated as appropriate (eg, transfusion, antibiotic therapy, surgical repair of a perforated viscus). If abdominal exploration is performed, the uterus should be inspected for a perforation site. The absence of a visible defect does not exclude a previous uterine perforation, since small defects may have closed spontaneously subsequent to the procedure. However, if a uterine defect is visible, it should be closed to prevent future intraperitoneal infection or bowel incarceration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS ON FUTURE REPRODUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A uterine perforation, like any uterine incision, is likely to heal well. Adhesion formation is possible, however, no adverse effects of uterine perforation on fertility have been reported.</p><p>Uterine perforation may weaken the uterine wall and raises concerns for an increased risk of uterine rupture during subsequent pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. The largest literature review regarding this issue identified 18 reports of uterine rupture in women who had a prior operative hysteroscopy, 10 of these women had a uterine perforation during the hysteroscopy; however, these women also had other risk factors for rupture (eg, extensive hysteroscopic resection of a septum or adhesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrosurgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Further high quality studies are needed.</p><p>We counsel women who have had a uterine perforation that there may be some elevated risk of uterine perforation in a subsequent pregnancy, but that the risk is likely minimal in the absence of other risk factors. We do not advise cesarean delivery for women with a uterine perforation who did not undergo a concurrent metroplasty, intrauterine adhesiolysis, or myomectomy and have not had a prior cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine perforation is a potential complication of all intrauterine procedures. Injury to surrounding blood vessels or viscera (bladder, bowel) may result. Uterine perforations that are not diagnosed at the time of the procedure can result in hemorrhage or sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that make access to the endometrial cavity difficult or alter the strength of the myometrial wall predispose to uterine perforation (eg, cervical stenosis, uterine malposition, pregnancy, menopause). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the night before a gynecologic procedure in women with cervical stenosis or for a procedure requiring mechanical dilation, we recommend the use of vaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> in premenopausal women (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) and suggest its use in postmenopausal women (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>) rather than no preparation. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Cervical preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In premenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy, we recommend treatment with vaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> on the night before surgery rather than no cervical preparation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We also use misoprostol in postmenopausal women, particularly those with cervical stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Cervical preparation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;, section on 'Cervical preparation and dilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women in whom cervical dilation cannot be accomplished using mechanical dilators with gentle pressure, we suggest further attempts be performed under ultrasound guidance (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Difficult cervical dilation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perforation should be suspected with deep penetration of instruments, loss of visualization, excessive bleeding or the identification of fat in the cavity or the curettage specimen. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with suspected or confirmed uterine perforation that occurred during cervical dilation or with a blunt instrument and who are hemodynamically stable, we suggest observation rather than immediate abdominal exploration (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for observation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal exploration is required for women in whom perforation occurred during use of electrosurgical energy or suction curettage, who are hemodynamically unstable, or in whom there are signs of severe uterine bleeding or vascular or visceral injury are suspected. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for surgical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For uterine perforation patients who require abdominal exploration and are hemodynamically stable, we suggest laparoscopy rather than laparotomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Use of laparoscopy depends on the availability of a surgeon who can adequately assess the bowel laparoscopically. Immediate laparotomy is generally necessary for patients who are not hemodynamically stable. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal exploration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine perforation may weaken the uterine wall and raises concerns for an increased risk of uterine rupture during subsequent pregnancy. However, this risk is likely minimal in the absence of other risk factors (eg, extensive hysteroscopic surgery, transmural myomectomy, previous cesarean delivery). We do not advise cesarean delivery for women with a uterine perforation who have no other risk factors for uterine rupture.
