Some NHLs behave indolently with lymphadenopathy waxing and waning over years. Others are highly aggressive, resulting in death within weeks if left untreated. In typical cases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive lymphomas commonly present acutely or subacutely with a rapidly growing mass, systemic B symptoms (ie, fever, night sweats, weight loss), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid. Examples of lymphomas with this aggressive or highly aggressive presentation include diffuse large B cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma, and precursor B and T lymphoblastic <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indolent lymphomas are often insidious, presenting only with slow growing lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or cytopenias. Examples of lymphomas that typically have indolent presentations include follicular lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/small</span> lymphocytic lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma.</p><p/><p>The natural history of these tumors shows significant patient-to-patient variability. Less common presentations include skin rash, pruritus, exaggerated (hypersensitivity) reactions to insect stings or bites, generalized fatigue, malaise, fever of unknown origin, ascites, and effusions. Approximately 50 percent of patients develop extranodal disease (secondary extranodal disease) during the course of their disease, while between 10 and 35 percent of patients have primary extranodal lymphoma at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The initial presentation may reflect involvement of extranodal tissues, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with primary gastrointestinal (GI) tract lymphoma may present with anorexia, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, chronic pain, abdominal fullness, early satiety, symptoms associated with visceral obstruction, or even acute perforation and GI hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68593 \">table 1</a>).

With recent advances in immunohistochemistry, it is now possible to detect almost all diagnostically relevant lymphoid markers in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections, with the important exception that stains for surface immunoglobulin light chains, which are very helpful in determining the clonality of B cell proliferations, remain challenging and are often uninformative. Frozen sections allow for better detection of light chains of certain other antigens, but in general such antigens are best evaluated by flow cytometry. Fresh frozen tissue remains the best source of high quality DNA and RNA for molecular studies, but genetic assays of clonality can now be conducted reliably using DNA retrieved from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Genetic studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Flow cytometry has certain advantages over immunohistochemistry, such as the ability to detect two or more markers simultaneously, rapid turnaround, greater quantitative capacity (eg, the ability to more reliably distinguish between high and more modest levels of expression of an antigen), and higher sensitivity for certain markers (eg, surface immunoglobulin light chains), but sometimes misses tumor cell populations due to sampling issues or poor tumor cell representation within cell suspensions (eg, in lymphomas associated with extensive fibrosis). It is a useful diagnostic tool when suspected lymphomas are sampled by fine needle aspirate, with the caveats cited above.</p><p>Immunophenotyping plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and subclassification of most forms of NHL. In general, the lymphoid neoplasms are divided according to whether they are of B, T, or NK cell derivation. The expression of cell surface lymphoid differentiation antigens are used to distinguish between B and T cells at various developmental stages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78061\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78061 \">table 4</a>).

These and other studies can be important adjunct tests when samples are obtained by FNA, where limited diagnostic material is available for conventional histologic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosomal abnormalities may be detected using conventional karyotypic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for abnormal gene products. A choice among these tests is made depending upon the clinical situation and the suspected diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement studies using PCR can determine clonality of B-lymphocytes since every normal B-lymphocyte carries one or two rearranged immunoglobulin heavy genes with a unique DNA sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. PCR with consensus IgH primers followed by sizing of products by capillary electrophoresis detects clonal rearrangements in about 85 percent of B cell lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. PCR testing is somewhat less sensitive than Southern blot analysis, but is more rapid, does not require radioactivity, and can be performed reliably on DNA retrieved from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues; for these reasons, it has almost entirely supplanted Southern blot analysis. At present, Southern blot analysis is still used to determine the clonality of EBV genomes in suspected EBV positive NHL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunoglobulin-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunoglobulin genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement studies using PCR can determine if T-lymphocytes are clonal or nonclonal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. The TCR is composed of several subunits, including heterodimers composed of the alpha <span class=\"nowrap\">(a)/beta</span> (b) and gamma <span class=\"nowrap\">(g)/delta</span> (d) chains in association with the CD3 complex. As with Ig rearrangements, PCR studies have largely replaced Southern blot analysis. PCR is conducted with consensus primers designed to amplify rearranged TCR gamma genes. When coupled to precise sizing of products by capillary electrophoresis, this test detects clonal rearrangements in about 90 percent of T cell lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

While potentially helpful, to date, GEP has mainly been restricted to the clinical research arena because of the requirement for fresh tissue and the technical complexity of performing GEP on older test platforms, such as Affymetrix gene chips. This is likely to change with the advent of new technologies that can reliably generate GEPs using RNA retrieved from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

Many centers now use sequencing to identify somatic mutations that are highly characteristic of certain lymphomas, such as MYD88 mutations in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and it is likely that the routine use of DNA sequencing as part of the work-up of NHL will expand rapidly in the future. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-lymphoplasmacytic-lymphoma#H9628277\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma&quot;, section on 'MYD88 mutations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, bone marrow (BM) involvement occurs in 30 to 50 percent of all patients with NHL, most commonly in the indolent histologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>]. There are also situations where BM is the only accessible site to make the diagnosis of NHL. Bone marrow involvement with NHL is usually focal, but on rare occasions patients may have extensive NHL confined to the bone marrow, presenting clinically with pancytopenia and systemic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p>Practically all patients with NHL should undergo a BM aspiration and biopsy prior to the initiation of treatment as part of their staging evaluation. A potential exception is for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), in whom the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is evolving. This is described in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>BM biopsy and aspirate specimens are typically evaluated for their morphology and immunophenotype. Aspirated cells can be subjected to analysis of cell surface markers by flow cytometry as well as cytogenetic analysis, both of which may provide key diagnostic information. However, some forms of NHL are commonly associated with marrow fibrosis (eg, follicular lymphoma) and, as a result, often inaspirable. For this reason, BM aspirates alone have a low yield of being positive in the absence of a positive BM biopsy, and are very often negative even when the bone marrow is involved, due to the presence of lymphoma-induced fibrosis that makes the involved portion of marrow inaspirable. BM involvement is seen in 18 to 36 percent of patients with aggressive and highly aggressive NHL and in 40 to 90 percent in patients with indolent NHLs, making the yield of marrow biopsy quite high in the latter setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/103,106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,106,107</a>]. However, in patients with stage I and II disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 5</a>), the yield is low for a positive BM biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].</p><p>The yield may be increased by performing bilateral bone marrow biopsies, but in most instances, involvement can be established with one adequate biopsy. Most patients receive systemic treatment as part of their overall management, and a single biopsy is sufficient for treatment planning.</p><p>Differences in morphology between the malignant cells in the bone marrow and a lymph node (eg, small cleaved cells in the BM and large cells in the lymph node), occur in 20 percent of follicular lymphomas and 40 percent of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, but not in small lymphocytic <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphoma/chronic</span> lymphocytic leukemia or Burkitt lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/104,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,109</a>].

However, there are less common subtypes of NHL that do not present with overt lymphadenopathy and require the pathologic evaluation of another tissue (ie, pleural fluid, spleen) for diagnosis. In addition, pathologic evaluation of these tissues may be necessary for the staging of patients with signs or symptoms worrisome for involvement of these sites or for patients with subtypes of NHL that have a high incidence of involvement of these tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebrospinal fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbar puncture with analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is indicated for patients suspected of having leptomeningeal metastases (lymphomatous meningitis) or primary central nervous system lymphoma and for patients with subtypes of NHL that have a high incidence of central nervous system involvement (eg, Burkitt lymphoma). If involved, the CSF often reveals an elevated protein concentration and a lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis. Glucose concentration is usually normal, but may be low. The presence of malignant lymphoid cells may be confirmed by cytology, immunohistochemistry performed on cytospin preparations, or flow cytometry.

Reactive T cells may be more prominent than the neoplastic cells. The presence of malignant lymphoid cells may be confirmed by cytology, immunohistochemistry performed on cytospin preparations or cells blocks, or flow cytometry. The differential diagnosis for patients who present with an effusion that is subsequently found to contain lymphoma cells includes systemic lymphomas with secondary involvement of the body fluid (ie, secondary effusion), extranodal variants of various subtypes of lymphoma (eg, extranodal large cell lymphoma), and lymphomas that develop primarily within chronic pleural effusions (ie, pyothorax associated lymphoma and primary effusion lymphoma).
