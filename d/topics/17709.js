Treatment of this disorder is primarily aimed at decreasing the urine output, usually by increasing the activity of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also called arginine vasopressin or AVP).</p><p>Replacement of previous and ongoing fluid losses is also important. Most patients with central DI have a normal or only mildly elevated plasma sodium concentration because concurrent stimulation of thirst minimizes the degree of net water loss. However, hypernatremia can occur if thirst is impaired or the patient has no access to water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Correction of the hypernatremia requires repair of this free water deficit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypernatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypernatremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of central DI will be reviewed here. The causes of this disorder and the approach to the patient with polyuria are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polyuria and diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H144709921\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three main options for the treatment of polyuria in patients with central DI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Desmopressin</a>, which is an ADH analog and is the preferred drug in almost all patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other drugs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpropamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpropamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, thiazide diuretics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low-solute (mostly low-sodium, low-protein) diet. In normal individuals, the urine output is primarily determined by fluid intake, a relationship that is mediated by changes in the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). When the urine osmolality is fixed, as in untreated DI, the urine output is determined by the intake and subsequent urinary excretion of solutes (mostly sodium salts and urea), which has been called the renal solute load. As an example, at a fixed urine osmolality of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg,</span> the urine output will be 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> if urinary solute excretion is 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/day</span> and 3 L if urinary solute excretion is 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/day</span> on a low-sodium, reduced-protein diet. A low-solute diet can be combined with a thiazide diuretic. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Low-solute diet and thiazide diuretics'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The choice of therapy varies with the severity of the polyuria. Patients with partial DI and mild to moderate polyuria and nocturia may be adequately controlled with a low-solute diet (if acceptable to the patient) and, if necessary, a thiazide diuretic. Although these modalities also reduce the urine output in patients with marked polyuria and nocturia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> therapy is usually required for symptom control. Desmopressin can also be used in patients with less severe DI who do not want to comply with a low-solute diet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H216816629\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC GOAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only symptoms of DI are polyuria, nocturia, and thirst (unless the patient has a hypothalamic lesion causing hypodipsia). Thirst is essential so that the excess urinary water losses can be replaced. Patients without an intact thirst mechanism can develop severe hypernatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hypernatremia-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Hypothalamic lesions affecting thirst or osmoreceptor function'</a>.)</p><p>The initial aim of therapy is to reduce nocturia, thereby providing adequate sleep, most often by the administration at bedtime of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a>, which is the <strong>preferred therapy</strong> for central DI. Once this is achieved, one aims for <strong>partial</strong> control of the diuresis during the day since complete control can lead to retention of water and hyponatremia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H216816636\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of hyponatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water retention leading to the development of hyponatremia is a potential risk in patients with central DI who are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> or other therapies that increase the response to or secretion of ADH (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpropamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpropamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>). Desmopressin-associated hyponatremia could lead to brain injury if the plasma sodium is not carefully monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Once desmopressin is given, the patient has nonsuppressible ADH activity and may be unable to excrete ingested water normally, possibly leading to hyponatremia, as occurs in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis of hyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p>Although thirst will be suppressed by effective therapy, much of the fluid intake during the day is not driven by thirst (eg, coffee with breakfast, soda with lunch and dinner). In addition, previously untreated patients may have become accustomed to drinking large amounts of fluids and may continue to do so for a short period after the initiation of effective therapy to control polyuria, possibly resulting in the development of hyponatremia. Thus, we suggest measuring the serum sodium one to two days after the initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> therapy and, if the initial measurement is normal, repeating the measurement at four days.</p><p>Once a stable dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> is achieved, annual or biannual monitoring of the serum sodium may be performed. If a patient treated with a stable dose of desmopressin begins experiencing increased urinary frequency or nocturia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the serum sodium is elevated, a 24-hour urine should be collected to ascertain whether the patient is polyuric.</p><p>Preventing water retention is more difficult in infants and young children and more frequent monitoring of the serum sodium concentration is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H45645699\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring of serum sodium'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H216816726\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing to prevent hyponatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the risk of hyponatremia, patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> should be educated about the symptoms that may be induced by hyponatremia. These include nausea, vomiting, headache, lethargy, and, if severe, seizures and coma. Patients should be instructed to call the clinician at the first sign of such manifestations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of hyponatremia and hypernatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Hyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Desmopressin</a> dosing is an empiric process. Hyponatremia can usually be avoided by giving the <strong>minimum</strong> desmopressin dose that is required to control the polyuria. The initial aim of therapy is to reduce nocturia, thereby permitting adequate sleep. Thus, the first dose (0.1 or 0.2 mg tablet or 5 to 10 mcg of the nasal spray) is typically given at bedtime. The size of and necessity for a daytime dose is determined by the effectiveness of the evening dose. If, for example, polyuria does not recur until noon, then one-half the evening dose may be sufficient at that time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H216816692\"><span class=\"h2\">Course of DI and duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of central DI varies with the cause. As examples, DI is permanent in idiopathic disease, most often transient following neurosurgery (usually transsphenoidal) or trauma, and may be reversible with appropriate therapy in patients with infiltrative diseases. The supportive data are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Desmopressin</a> therapy should be continued for as long as the patient has symptomatic central DI. As mentioned above, the goal of therapy is control of nocturia and partial control of polyuria during the day since more aggressive therapy can promote the development of hyponatremia. The DI induced by neurosurgery or trauma is often transient. Thus, such patients should be questioned carefully at each visit about the degree of polyuria. If the polyuria is said to be less pronounced or to have ceased, the desmopressin dose can be gradually tapered and eventually withdrawn if polyuria does not recur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DESMOPRESSIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the primary problem in central DI is deficient secretion of ADH, control of the polyuria can be achieved by hormone replacement. In the past, this was achieved by intramuscular injections of vasopressin (Pitressin) tannate in oil, which is no longer available. This preparation had two problems: the requirement for intramuscular administration; and the occasional development of anti-vasopressin antibodies with a secondary increase in urine output that appears to be ADH resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Intramuscular vasopressin has been replaced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (dDAVP), a two-amino acid substitute of ADH that has potent antidiuretic but no vasopressor activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H144709866\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Desmopressin</a> comes in liquid form that is usually administered intranasally, in an oral tablet form, and in a parenteral formulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F90924\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90924 \">table 1</a>). The intranasal preparation can be blown into the nose by the patient with a curved, dose-calibrated small plastic tube or delivered with a nasal spray. An initial dose of 5 mcg at bedtime can be titrated upward in 5 mcg increments depending upon the response of the nocturia and then additional daytime doses added. The daily maintenance dose is about 5 to 20 mcg once or twice a day.</p><p>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> metered spray bottle is currently used more commonly than the rhinal tube because of greater convenience of administration. Although flexibility is more limited with the metered spray bottle because the minimum dose is 10 mcg, this does not represent a problem for most patients. The usual daily maintenance dose is 10 to 20 mcg intranasally once or twice a day. Using a urine osmolality of 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> or greater to judge effect, the mean duration of action after 10 and 20 mcg intranasal doses was seven to nine hours, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>An oral tablet preparation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> is also available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The absorption of desmopressin in normal persons is decreased by 40 to 50 percent when taken with meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This usually has little effect on the antidiuretic action but administering the drug in the fasting state may be tried if there is a poor response to the usual doses taken with meals.</p><p>The oral form has about one-tenth to one-twentieth the potency of the nasal form because only about five percent is absorbed from the gut. Thus, a 0.1 mg tablet is the equivalent of 2.5 to 5 mcg of the nasal spray. However, because the oral dose cannot be precisely predicted from a previous nasal dose, transfer of patients from nasal insufflation to oral therapy usually requires some dose retitration.</p><p>The initial dose of the tablet form is 0.05 mg (one-half a 0.1 mg tablet) at bedtime with titration as with the liquid form. The usual daily maintenance dose ranges from 0.1 mg to 0.8 mg in divided doses but may be as high as 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p>There are few long-term data on the use of the tablet form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a>. In one study, eight children with central DI were treated and followed for up to 3.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There was no attenuation of the antidiuretic effect, and no side effects or antibody formation were noted. In another report, ten adults had satisfactory maintenance of the antidiuretic effect over one year with doses of 0.3 to 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> given in two to three doses per day; doses larger than 0.2 mg had no greater effect, eg, 0.4 versus 0.2 mg, but probably lasted longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Desmopressin</a> has also been developed as a sublingual lyophilisate (melt) formulation containing 60, 120, and 240 mcg. This formulation improves the bioavailability of desmopressin by approximately 60 percent compared with the tablet.</p><p>Although patients generally prefer the oral preparation because of ease of administration, not all patients have an adequate response. As a result, we recommend starting with the intranasal preparation; this ensures that the patient understands what constitutes a good antidiuretic response prior to performing a trial of oral therapy.</p><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> cannot be administered intranasally or orally, it can be given subcutaneously. A usual antidiuretic dose is 1 mcg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours. Some patients do not respond well to subcutaneous desmopressin due to inadequate absorption. Such patients can be treated with 2 mcg of desmopressin acetate given intravenously over two minutes; the duration of action, as judged by increased urine osmolality, will be 12 hours or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Desmopressin</a> is <strong>safe</strong> during pregnancy for both the mother and the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the vast majority of patients with central DI, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> is readily available, safe, and effective. Other drugs that can be used are thiazide diuretics, which act independent of ADH, and, in patients with partial central DI (ie, there is some circulating vasopressin), drugs that increase ADH release or enhance ADH effect on the kidney such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpropamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpropamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, clofibrate, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These drugs are associated with more side effects than desmopressin and are generally less effective, lowering the urine output by 25 to 60 percent, although a greater effect may be seen with thiazide diuretics.</p><p>Thiazide diuretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also constitute the only effective therapy for nephrogenic DI, which is characterized by ADH resistance.

Studies in animals suggest that this response may be mediated by enhanced sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb (thereby increasing the degree of medullary hypertonicity) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by increased collecting tubule permeability to water; how these changes occur is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

In adults, the intravenous administration of dextrose and water at more than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> delivers glucose at a rate that exceeds endogenous metabolic capacity for glucose even in patients without diabetes mellitus, possibly leading to severe and symptomatic hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thus, intravenous rates of fluid replacement with dextrose in water should be limited to a maximum of 500 to 750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> and serum glucose levels should be monitored. Avoiding excess dextrose administration can be more readily achieved by administering desmopressin to reduce the urine flow rate.</p><p>This sequence can also occur when patients with central DI and impaired consciousness present with polyuria and hypernatremia of unknown cause.

Most patients have a normal or only mildly elevated plasma sodium concentration because concurrent stimulation of thirst minimizes the degree of net water loss. Treatment of this disorder is aimed at decreasing the urine output. (See <a href=\"#H216816629\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic goal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three major therapeutic options: a low-solute (sodium and protein) diet; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> (dDAVP), an ADH analog; and other drugs, including thiazide diuretics. The choice of therapy varies with the severity of the polyuria. Patients with partial DI and mild to moderate polyuria and nocturia may be adequately controlled with a low-solute diet (if acceptable to the patient) and, if necessary, a thiazide diuretic. Although these modalities also reduce the urine output in patients with marked polyuria and nocturia, desmopressin therapy is usually required for symptom control. Desmopressin can also be used in patients with less severe DI who do not want to comply with a low-solute diet.

The serum sodium concentration should be checked at 24 hours after the initiation of desmopressin therapy and patients educated about the symptoms that may be induced by hyponatremia.

As a result, monitoring of the serum sodium concentration and body weight is important to detect hypernatremia due to water loss with a low-solute diet and thiazide diuretic and to detect hyponatremia due to water retention resulting from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a> therapy.
