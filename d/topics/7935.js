Patients in the progressive phase of GBS require close monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular function, often in the intensive care unit. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment with plasma exchange or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) is indicated for most patients with GBS because these treatments accelerate recovery. We recommend treatment with plasma exchange or IVIG for nonambulatory adult patients with GBS who are within four weeks of symptom onset. In addition, we suggest treatment with plasma exchange or IVIG for ambulatory adult patients with GBS who are not yet recovering within four weeks of symptom onset. The choice between plasma exchange and IVIG is dependent on local availability and on patient preference, risk factors, and contraindications. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Disease-modifying treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORTIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supportive care is extremely important in Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) since up to 30 percent of patients develop neuromuscular respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, autonomic dysfunction may be severe enough to require intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, many patients with GBS are initially admitted to the ICU for close monitoring of respiratory, cardiac, and hemodynamic function. Less severely affected patients can be managed in intermediate care units, and mildly affected patients can be managed on the general ward with telemetry, along with monitoring of blood pressure and vital capacity every four hours.</p><p>Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, bladder and bowel care, physical and occupational therapy, and psychological support are essential. Low molecular weight heparin and support stockings are recommended until patients are able to walk independently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Bedbound patients should have frequent repositioning to avoid pressure ulcers. Adequate pain control is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> below.)</p><p>Issues related to the respiratory management of patients with neuromuscular weakness are also discussed separately.

Thus, close respiratory monitoring with frequent measurement (eg, every four hours) of vital capacity and negative inspiratory force (NIF) should be instituted initially in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Hypotension can usually be treated with fluids, but low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> can be used if fluids are not effective. In the presence of dysautonomia, only low doses of carefully titrated short-acting vasoactive agents should be used for treatment of hypotension and hypertension because of the potential to overshoot the target blood pressure in the setting of possible denervation hypersensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Episodes of severe hypertension (mean arterial pressure &gt;125 mmHg) can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esmolol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

These treatments hasten recovery from GBS, as shown in randomized controlled trials. Patients recover sooner when treated early. The beneficial effects of plasma exchange and IVIG are believed to be equivalent, while combining the two treatments is not beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>We recommend treatment with plasma exchange or IVIG for nonambulatory adult patients with GBS who are within four weeks of symptom onset. In addition, we suggest treatment with plasma exchange or IVIG for ambulatory adult patients with GBS who are not yet recovering within four weeks of symptom onset. The choice between plasma exchange and IVIG is dependent on local availability and on patient preference, risk factors, and contraindications. Patients who are mildly affected and already recovering do not require disease-modifying therapy. These recommendations are in general agreement with guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. When both therapies are equally available and there are no contraindications for either, we suggest treatment with IVIG. </p><p>Plasmapheresis is thought to remove circulating antibodies, complement, and soluble biological response modifiers. The precise mechanism of action for IVIG in GBS is unknown but may include providing anti-idiotypic antibodies, modulating expression and function of Fc receptors, interfering with activation of complement and production of cytokines, and interfering with activation and effector functions of T and B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].
