The term solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is a misnomer. Endoscopic findings in patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome can range from mucosal erythema alone to single or multiple ulcers and <span class=\"nowrap\">polypoid/mass</span> lesions. This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. Other causes of chronic colonic ulceration, including ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, and ischemic colitis, are discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonic-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colonic ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454498672\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is uncertain but has been estimated in one study to be 1 in 100,000 individuals per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In one retrospective study of 80 patients, the median age at diagnosis was 48 years with a range of 14 to 76 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Men and women appear to be affected equally, but a slight female preponderance has been suggested in various reports. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of the solitary rectal ulcer is incompletely understood. However, a number of factors appear to have a causative role in individual reports. It is possible that different etiologies may contribute to the development of the final lesion.</p><p>A common observation in a number of reports is rectal prolapse and paradoxical contraction of the puborectalis muscle, which can result in rectal trauma by two different mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolapsed rectal mucosa is forced downward due to the pressures generated by the rectum during defecation. The opposing force of the paradoxical contraction of the puborectalis muscle can generate high pressures within the rectum and lead to mucosal ischemia, thus predisposing to ulceration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shear forces on the rectal mucosa are caused by the contraction of the puborectalis muscle.</p><p/><p>However, excessive puborectalis contraction is not found in all patients with solitary rectal ulcer. Furthermore, it is unclear whether prolapse causes ulceration or whether they are both varying manifestations of a similar disease process. It is also possible that prolapse is an associated condition rather than a causative one, a hypothesis supported by a study in which surgical correction of the rectal prolapse had no significant impact on symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A case-control study compared anorectal physiology and defecation proctography in 25 patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome with matched controls with either outlet obstruction (25 patients), overt rectal prolapse without any mucosal change (25 patients), or overt rectal prolapse with mucosal changes (14 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome more frequently had increasing anal pressure at strain, paradoxical puborectalis contraction and prolapse of the inner circular smooth muscle of the rectum, and less frequently had complete rectal emptying compared with the control groups. Compared with patients with overt rectal prolapse, mean resting and squeezing anal pressures were significantly higher.</p><p>Direct digital trauma has also been implicated since many patients have a history of constipation and report attempts at manual disimpaction. However, a number of lesions have been described that were beyond the reach of an inserted finger.</p><p>A possible hormonal cause has also been proposed. A case report documented a woman with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome that resolved during two pregnancies but recurred when she was not pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454498744\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28279789\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms may be absent in up to 26 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In an illustrative series of 98 patients with a clinicopathologic diagnosis of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, the most common symptoms were rectal bleeding (56 percent), straining (28 percent), and pelvic fullness (23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Mucous discharge, incontinence, tenesmus, and pain were less frequently described. A complete or incomplete rectal prolapse may be demonstrated during straining.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28279795\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Barium</a> enema may be normal or may have nonspecific findings, including granularity of the mucosa, thickened rectal folds, and a rectal stricture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727938514\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is usually diagnosed incidentally during the course of evaluation of the patient's symptoms of rectal bleeding, tenesmus, or straining during defecation. The endoscopic appearance of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, while supportive of the diagnosis, is not specific. The diagnosis is made on the basis of histologic finding of fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454499026\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy and histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endoscopic findings range from mucosal erythema to single or multiple ulcers and <span class=\"nowrap\">polypoid/mass</span> lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>]. In one retrospective study of 51 patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, only 35 percent of patients had a solitary rectal ulceration, 22 percent had multiple ulcers, and 43 percent of patients had non-ulcerative lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ulcers are usually superficial and 1 to 1.5 cm in diameter, but they can range in size from 0.5 to 4 cm. In the majority of patients, the lesions are located in the anterior rectal wall within 10 cm of the anal verge, but they can also be located in the anal canal or the sigmoid colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13</a>]. </p><p>On histology, solitary rectal ulcer is characterized by fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria that leads to hypertrophy and disorganization of the muscularis mucosa and regenerative changes with distortion of crypt architecture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In polypoid cases, the mucosa has a villiform configuration, and in some cases, the glands may be trapped in the submucosa (colitis cystica profunda) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727938433\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, we perform an additional evaluation to diagnose a rectal prolapse and to guide management. (See <a href=\"#H454499823\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454499532\"><span class=\"h2\">Defecography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defecography can demonstrate rectal prolapse as well as incomplete or delayed rectal emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a study of 53 patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, 40 (75 percent) had abnormalities on defecography. The most common findings were internal and external rectal prolapse and delayed rectal emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of chronic constipation in adults&quot;, section on 'Defecography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing#H42686006\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal motility testing&quot;, section on 'Anorectum'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727938377\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopic ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can be used as an alternative to defecography to diagnose rectal intussusception in patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. Other EUS findings in patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome include thickening of the rectal wall and internal anal sphincter and loss of distinction between the planes of the mucosa and muscularis propria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, unlike defecography, EUS cannot diagnose coexisting functional abnormalities of the anorectum. EUS is also limited by its availability, operator dependance, and cost. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-in-rectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound in rectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454498640\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to diagnose solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, it is important to distinguish it from other disorders that can have similar clinical presentation and endoscopic appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19</a>]. The presence of collagen infiltration of the lamina propria can be helpful for distinguishing solitary rectal ulcer syndrome from other etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory bowel disease</strong> &ndash; Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease can have a similar endoscopic appearance to solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. In addition, prolapsed mucosa in patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome may contain inflamed and distorted mucosa and may be misdiagnosed as inflammatory bowel disease. However, the presence of smooth muscle between crypts on biopsy can help differentiate solitary rectal ulcer syndrome from inflammatory bowel disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-ulcerative-colitis-in-adults#H596557081\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of ulcerative colitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Endoscopy and biopsy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults#H2893457\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and prognosis of Crohn disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Endoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ischemic colitis</strong> &ndash; Chronic ischemic colitis may manifest as colonic strictures, mucosal atrophy, or areas of granulation tissue. Biopsy of a post-ischemic stricture is marked by extensive transmural fibrosis that makes it difficult to distinguish from solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. However, patients with ischemic colitis generally have a history of underlying vascular disease or other risk factors (eg, aortic surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, myocardial infarction, hemodialysis, dehydration, thrombophilia). The clinical presentation and diagnosis of ischemic colitis are discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colonic-ischemia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colonic ischemia&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infectious proctitis</strong> &ndash; Amebiasis, lymphogranuloma venereum, and secondary syphilis may present with proctitis and rectal ulceration. However, on biopsy, features of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome are absent and acute inflammation in the lamina propria with neutrophilic infiltration of crypts may be seen. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454499823\"><span class=\"h2\">Management approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome depends upon the severity of symptoms and the presence of a rectal prolapse. We suggest observation alone or treatment with bulk laxatives and biofeedback in patients who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. We reserve surgery for symptomatic patients with rectal prolapse and for patients with severe symptoms that are unresponsive to conservative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rectal-procidentia-rectal-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of rectal procidentia (rectal prolapse)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Conservative treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative management includes stool bulking agents and retraining of bowel habits using biofeedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a retrospective study of 80 patients with solitary rectal ulcer, conservative therapy with bulk laxatives and bowel retraining was associated with a symptomatic improvement in 11 of 59 patients (19 percent) at a median follow-up of 25 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In contrast, none of the 22 patients with rectal prolapse had an improvement in symptoms. Other reports have also suggested improvement with biofeedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/6,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23,24</a>]. However, the durability of the benefit of biofeedback therapy is unclear, and repeat treatment may be needed. In one study that included 13 patients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, approximately one-half of the seven who initially responded to biofeedback relapsed within 36 months after training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chronic constipation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical options include local excision, rectopexy, or fecal diversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/4,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,25</a>]. In patients without evidence of a rectal prolapse, local excision or suturing can provide symptomatic relief but with uncertain long-term benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In patients with a rectal prolapse, rectopexy is the procedure of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In one small study, this procedure resulted in symptomatic improvement in 83 percent of patients with the polypoid form of solitary rectal ulcer and in 67 percent of patients with an ulcerated lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Fecal diversion approaches should be reserved for patients who have failed other surgical modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/solitary-rectal-ulcer-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].
