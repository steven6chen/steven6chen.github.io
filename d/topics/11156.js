In addition, patients are more likely to develop complications such as psychotic features and catatonic features and have a history of severe or recurrent episodes. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and often require hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Treating major depression with psychotic features or catatonia is discussed separately.

The presence of these somatic symptoms should be evaluated in the context of normal expectations for the postpartum period. As an example, postpartum patients frequently lack energy due to sleep deprivation and caring for an infant. However, lack of energy to the point that patients need to make a significant effort to initiate or maintain usual daily activities can be a mild to moderate depressive symptom, and anergia to the point that patients cannot get out of bed for hours is probably a symptom of severe depression. Persistent uncertainty as to whether an episode of major depression is mild to moderate or severe can be resolved by referral to a psychiatrist (preferably one specializing in perinatal disorders). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3763314988\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general principles and issues that are involved in treating postpartum unipolar major depression include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting (eg, outpatient or inpatient)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of prior treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Educating patients and families</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adherence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribing antidepressants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Managing nonresponse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making referrals</p><p/><p>These general principles are discussed in detail separately.

Patients start with initial therapy and progress through each step until they respond. The primary treatments are psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy). However, many patients receive antidepressant medications. </p><p>Continuation treatment is generally indicated for patients who respond to acute treatment of unipolar major depression, and additional maintenance treatment is indicated for patients with an increased risk of recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-continuation-and-maintenance-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Continuation and maintenance treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3511002067\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For mild to moderate postpartum unipolar major depression, we suggest psychotherapy as initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. This approach is consistent with multiple practice guidelines, and is especially useful for lactating patients who do not want to expose their infants to antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/6,7,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,11-14</a>]. However, antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>) are a reasonable alternative if psychotherapy is not available, not successful, or is declined, or if the patient has previously responded to antidepressants. In addition, combination treatment with pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy is useful for some patients. For patients with mild to moderate unipolar major depression who are breastfeeding and choose treatment with an antidepressant, there is a general consensus that the benefits of antidepressants outweigh the potential risks to the infant; the risks are regarded as low. The use and efficacy of pharmacotherapy in postpartum depression, and the safety of infant exposure to antidepressants, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment#H23539406\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe postpartum unipolar major depression: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Initial treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-of-infant-exposure-to-antidepressants-and-benzodiazepines-through-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety of infant exposure to antidepressants and benzodiazepines through breastfeeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When using psychotherapy to treat postpartum major depression, we typically choose either cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy, based upon their demonstrated efficacy in multiple randomized trials in the general population of patients with major depression, as well as patients with postpartum depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, reasonable alternatives include behavioral activation, nondirective counseling, and psychodynamic psychotherapy. Few head-to-head psychotherapy trials have been conducted in patients with postpartum depression. </p><p>The basic approach of each therapy as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong> combines cognitive therapy with behavioral therapy. Cognitive therapy is intended to modify dysfunctional thoughts and illness beliefs; behavioral therapy is intended to change problematic behaviors that occur in response to dysfunctional thoughts, depressive symptoms, and environmental stimuli. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-psychotherapies#H432862147\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of psychotherapies&quot;, section on 'Cognitive and behavioral therapies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Interpersonal psychotherapy</strong> focuses upon improving problematic interpersonal relationships or circumstances that are directly related to the current depressive episode; these interpersonal problems include role disputes (eg, marital conflicts) and role transitions (eg, becoming a mother). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=interpersonal-psychotherapy-ipt-for-depressed-adults-indications-theoretical-foundation-general-concepts-and-efficacy#H91117026\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) for depressed adults: Indications, theoretical foundation, general concepts, and efficacy&quot;, section on 'Interpersonal problem areas'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Behavioral activation</strong> is one component of CBT that is often administered on its own. The intervention aims to counteract inertia and avoidance by promoting activities and behaviors that are rewarding, decreasing avoidance behaviors and rumination, and by helping patients to improve their problem solving skills. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nondirective counseling</strong> (also called listening visits) aims to help patients gain insight into and acceptance of their feelings, values, and behavior. The pace, direction, and content are determined by patients; the therapist acts as a facilitator by encouraging patients to speak, rather than providing explanations or interpretations. Nurses often administer nondirective counseling in the patient&rsquo;s home, whereas other psychotherapies are typically provided by doctoral level therapists in a clinic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychodynamic psychotherapy</strong> is intended to enhance insight into repetitive conflicts by identifying patterns of relationships, feelings, and behaviors; the patient works toward developing more productive coping styles (defense mechanisms). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-psychodynamic-psychotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Psychodynamic psychotherapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>Some psychotherapies (eg, CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, and behavioral activation), which were originally developed for the general population of patients with major depression, have been modified for use in postpartum patients, and are administered according to standardized treatment manuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Although psychotherapy is typically administered individually, some psychotherapies (eg, CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy) for postpartum depression have been successfully adapted to a group format [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Group therapy includes several useful elements, such as developing communication skills, normalizing one&rsquo;s problems by receiving support (eg, advice, empathy, and validation) from other patients who are experiencing similar problems, reducing social isolation and feelings of loneliness, increasing a sense of belonging and companionship, and learning through the modeling of others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Some psychotherapies (eg, CBT or behavioral activation) can also be administered by computer (internet) to enhance accessibility, scheduling flexibility, and privacy. Multiple randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of web-based interventions for postnatal depressive symptoms and syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, the rate of attrition in some studies was high.</p><p>One randomized trial found that CBT administered by telephone was also efficacious for patients with mild to moderate postnatal depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Psychotherapy for unipolar major depression is typically time limited (eg, 6 to 12 sessions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, patients treated with CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy generally receive a full course of therapy, regardless if nonresponse persists through the middle phases of treatment. Nevertheless, the optimal length of treatment is not known, and relatively short interventions may be preferable for new mothers who feel they lack the time and energy to participate in longer treatments. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H892549658\"><span class=\"h4\">Evidence of efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the studies that have evaluated psychotherapy for treating postpartum major depression have limitations; these include identifying cases of major depression with self-report questionnaires rather than clinical interviews, and the failure to adequately blind outcome ratings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-to-moderate-postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-treatment/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>]. In addition, trials commonly lack active comparators to control for the nonspecific aspects (eg, attention) of psychotherapy, and instead use less rigorous comparators such as usual care or waiting lists. </p><p>Evidence for the efficacy of psychotherapy includes numerous randomized trials in the general population of patients with unipolar major depression.

Patients with mild to moderate illness generally do not manifest suicidal behavior or obvious impairment of functioning, are less likely to develop complications such as psychotic features, and can typically be managed in outpatient or partial hospital settings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe unipolar major depression is characterized by seven to nine depressive symptoms. Severely ill patients often report suicidal ideation and behavior, typically demonstrate obvious impairment of functioning, and often manifest poor judgement that places the patient and others at risk for imminent harm. Patients with severe major depression should be referred to a psychiatrist for management and often require hospitalization.

However, antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a>) are a reasonable alternative if psychotherapy is not available, not successful, or is declined, or if the patient has previously responded to antidepressants. In addition, combination treatment with pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy is useful for some patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When using psychotherapy, we typically choose either cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy. Reasonable alternatives include behavioral activation, nondirective counseling, and psychodynamic psychotherapy.

For these treatment resistant patients who achieve a partial response (eg, reduction of baseline symptoms 25 to 49 percent), we suggest increasing the total number of sessions and the frequency of treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients who are treated with either CBT or interpersonal psychotherapy and achieve only a minimal response (eg, improvement &lt;25 percent), we suggest switching to the other psychotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
