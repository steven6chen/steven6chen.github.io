It usually happens in just one part of the body, such as an arm or leg.</p><p>Both adults and children can get CRPS. In adults, it often starts after a bone fracture, an injury (such as a sprain), surgery, or a stroke. Doctors are not sure how or why it starts. People who have CRPS have worse pain than doctors would expect from the injury, surgery, or other medical problem. In some cases, especially in children, CRPS can start without any injury or surgery happening first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14925255\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of complex regional pain syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, CRPS usually affects the arms. In children, CRPS most often affects the legs.</p><p>Symptoms of CRPS can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain &ndash; The pain can be burning, tingling, throbbing, or aching. It can also be severe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being sensitive to touch or cold, or not feeling touch or pain normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the body part with CRPS</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble moving the body part with CRPS due to pain, swelling, or stiffness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tremor (shaking) or muscle spasm in the body part with CRPS</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes &ndash; These might include changes in skin thickness, temperature, or color, or sweating more or less than usual.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in the way the hair and nails grow</p><p/><p>In most cases, the first symptoms of CRPS include pain, redness, and swelling of the affected body part. Usually the part with CRPS feels warm at first, but might later change from warm to cold. In other people, it feels cold at first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14925272\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for complex regional pain syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is not just one test doctors can do to find CRPS.</p><p>The doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask questions. He or she can usually tell if a person has CRPS from the symptoms, medical history, and exam.</p><p>If a doctor is not sure if a person has CRPS, he or she might order imaging tests such as a bone scan, X-ray, or MRI. These tests create pictures of the inside of the body. They can show changes to the bones, joints, or skin that might be caused by CRPS.</p><p>Doctors can also do tests that measure skin temperature, sweating, and nerve sensitivity. These tests are not usually needed. The doctor might do them if he or she needs extra information.</p><p>For children with CRPS, doctors might do blood tests and imaging tests to make sure a different condition is not causing the symptoms. Once the doctor or nurse knows a child has CRPS, other tests are not usually needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14925289\"><span class=\"h1\">How is complex regional pain syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for CRPS is different for each person. Doctors can try different treatments to see what works best.</p><p>For adults, treatments for CRPS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learning about CRPS &ndash; For example, it is important to know that even though CRPS hurts, it does not damage the body part. Joining a support group can help a person with CRPS deal with symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talking with a counselor &ndash; This can help reduce stress. Stress at work or home can be part of CRPS or make it worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy to learn exercises and stretches, and keep the body part with CRPS working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking medicines to relieve pain &ndash; These can be prescription or over-the-counter medicines, depending on what the doctor or nurse thinks might work best.</p><p/><p>If these treatments do not help, people with severe CRPS should see a doctor who specializes in treating pain. These doctors might try other treatments, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injections (shots) of numbing or pain-relieving medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain-relieving medicine given in the spine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Devices to help stop nerve signals of pain</p><p/><p>The main treatments for children with CRPS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical and occupational therapy &ndash; This involves learning exercises, movements, and ways of doing everyday tasks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Counseling to reduce stress and anxiety &ndash; Working with a counselor is also important to treat mental or emotional problems that could be part of CRPS.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14925304\"><span class=\"h1\">Can complex regional pain syndrome be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. Taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin C</a> after breaking a bone or having surgery might help prevent CRPS.</p><p>In adults who have a bone fracture, injury, or stroke, keeping a body part moving can help prevent CRPS. For example, if someone with a stroke is partly paralyzed, a therapist can gently move the paralyzed parts of his or her body. This can be done even if the person cannot get out of bed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14925321\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-wrist-injuries-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common wrist injuries (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibromyalgia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fibromyalgia (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
