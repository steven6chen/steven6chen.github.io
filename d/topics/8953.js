They are, however, staged based on the FIGO Stage. The management of these patients is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H473164634\" class=\"local\">'Placental site or epithelioid trophoblastic tumor'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H534180470\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is uniquely sensitive to chemotherapy, which is the major<strong> </strong>treatment modality for patients with high-risk disease. The exception to this is women with placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) or epithelioid trophoblastic tumor (ETT), which are relatively resistant to chemotherapy as compared with choriocarcinoma and invasive mole. As such, the primary treatment may be a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Regardless, in the treatment of high-risk GTN, other modalities such as surgery and radiation therapy (RT) may be indicated in addition to chemotherapy. </p><p>For patients in whom combination chemotherapy is indicated, treatment may result in ovarian insufficiency. Therefore, we advocate for the use of oral contraceptives to suppress the pituitary glands' production of luteinizing hormone, which aims to protect the ovaries from the toxicity of chemotherapy and also suppress the pituitary production of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which in our clinical experience, could falsely suggest the presence of active disease if not suppressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-high-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Therefore, these patients are commonly treated with multi-agent regimens. Evidence of the greater likelihood of resistance to single-agent chemotherapy comes from a retrospective study that included over 300 patients treated for nonmetastatic GTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-high-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although all patients were cured, 27 of 253 patients (11 percent) initially treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) developed resistance. In this series, only six patients experienced a relapse after obtaining a remission; of these, five patients had a choriocarcinoma. </p><p>Our preferred regimen for these patients is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, MTX, plus actinomycin D (ActD) alternating with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> (EMA-CO) because it results in complete response rates between 71 and 78 percent and long-term survival rates of 85 to 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-high-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/3-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-11</a>]. However, a 2012 Cochrane review has found that regimens that incorporate etoposide and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> are effective options, though the lack of randomized trials prevented an analysis to define the optimal regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-high-risk-gestational-trophoblastic-neoplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19647766\"><span class=\"h3\">EMA-CO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMA-CO has emerged as the regimen of choice for initial treatment of high-risk GTN.
