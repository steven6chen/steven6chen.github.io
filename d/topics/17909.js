The granulomas may occur in any organ, but the most frequently affected sites are the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, and liver. Patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis are most often asymptomatic at presentation. When symptomatic, patients usually report dyspnea, cough, or nonspecific chest discomfort. Spontaneous resolution of the disease is common, but progressive lung disease occurs in approximately 25 percent and disabling organ failure in up to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Glucocorticoids (also called corticosteroids) have long been the most commonly used agents for the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis, as they appear to attenuate the granulomatous inflammatory process. The key questions regarding the treatment of sarcoidosis with glucocorticoids are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the indications for treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When should therapy be started?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the optimal duration of therapy?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How should the disease course and the response to therapy be monitored?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does treatment alter the course of pulmonary sarcoidosis?</p><p/><p>An overview of the initial treatment of sarcoidosis will be presented here. The clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of sarcoidosis and the treatment of sarcoidosis with alternatives to glucocorticoids are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-disease-refractory-to-glucocorticoid-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis: Disease refractory to glucocorticoid therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis do not require treatment, as a high proportion have asymptomatic, nonprogressive disease or experience a spontaneous remission. For those with more severe lung involvement, therapy of sarcoidosis is aimed at reducing the burden of granulomatous inflammation and preventing the development of irreversible end-organ damage (eg, honeycombing and fibrotic lung disease), while avoiding excess toxicity from medications. The cause of sarcoidosis is unknown, and clinical trial data are limited, so the majority of treatment decisions are based on observation and expert opinion. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Initial therapy</strong> &ndash; Oral glucocorticoids have been the most commonly used agents for the relief of symptoms and control of potentially disabling respiratory impairment from pulmonary sarcoidosis, even if they do not cure the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prior to initiating therapy, patients are assessed for comorbid diseases that may contribute to their symptoms but not respond to glucocorticoid therapy (eg, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, pulmonary hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis must be excluded. Testing generally includes tuberculous skin test or interferon-gamma release assay, pulmonary function tests, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, and often an echocardiogram.

Other patients may be intolerant of glucocorticoids and be candidates for immunosuppressive therapy on that basis. Intensification of therapy for these patients typically involves immunosuppressive agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors). Referral to a sarcoidosis center may be prudent. The management of pulmonary sarcoidosis that is refractory to oral glucocorticoids is described separately.

These patients are followed for three to six months to identify progression of disease before instituting therapy. In this setting, it is important to document progressive impairment of lung function or gas exchange before starting therapy, because approximately 50 percent of untreated patients with stage II radiographic changes will have <strong>radiographic resolution</strong> by 36 months. (See <a href=\"#H3284522229\" class=\"local\">'Inhaled glucocorticoid therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic patients with stage III disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56321\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56321 \">table 1</a>) and normal or mildly abnormal lung function. These patients can also be closely followed for three to six months. However, because only approximately 33 percent of untreated patients with stage III radiographic changes show disease resolution after five years, the majority of these patients will require therapy. </p><p/><p>A multicenter British study examined the question of whether patients with asymptomatic pulmonary parenchymal disease (stage II or III) would have a better long-term outcome if they received long-term (18 months) glucocorticoid therapy aimed at optimizing the radiographic appearance, rather than continued observation with treatment initiation if symptoms worsened or lung function deteriorated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At five years, the average vital capacity was higher by 9 percent of the predicted value in the long-term glucocorticoid group. However, two-thirds of those who received glucocorticoid therapy experienced adverse effects, including weight gain, cushingoid features, and gastrointestinal disturbances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION OF GLUCOCORTICOIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact mechanism of action of glucocorticoids in the treatment of sarcoidosis is unknown. Based on pathologic studies, sarcoid granulomas have a tightly packed central area, composed of macrophages, epithelioid cells, and multinucleated giant cells. This central area is surrounded by lymphocytes, monocytes, mast cells, and fibroblasts. T lymphocytes are the prime drivers of the immune response. Several cytokines produced by these inflammatory cells, especially T lymphocytes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of granuloma formation and the subsequent development of fibrosis, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-2R, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Glucocorticoids appear to exert their effects on sarcoid granulomas through transcriptional regulation of glucocorticoid-receptor target genes and also non-genomic signal transduction pathways in lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67246 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/1,4,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,8-10</a>]. A number of the cytokines mentioned above that appear to participate in granulomatous inflammation are modulated by glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid effects on the immune system&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110264147\"><span class=\"h1\">ORAL GLUCOCORTICOID THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral glucocorticoid therapy generally improves symptoms (eg, cough and dyspnea) and radiographic abnormalities, at least initially. However, the known side effects of glucocorticoids and the uncertain effect of therapy on long-term outcome make it important to select patients carefully.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When assessing the indications for glucocorticoid therapy, it is helpful to keep in mind that certain features help to predict the likely course of disease. A longer period of watchful waiting prior to initiating therapy may be possible in patients with more favorable characteristics. Favorable characteristics include stage I disease, especially when associated with erythema nodosum, absence of symptoms, and European descent. Unfavorable prognostic features, in contrast, include the presence of symptoms (especially dyspnea), multisystem involvement (three or more organs involved), increasing chest radiographic opacities, extrapulmonary disease involving skin, bone, or joints (especially if age greater than 30 years), and African descent (only 12 percent with stage I disease show rapid recovery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3777806054\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary sarcoidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual indication for therapy of pulmonary sarcoidosis is a combination of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/3,6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bothersome pulmonary symptoms (eg, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or discomfort, hemoptysis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deteriorating lung function, as assessed by serial testing at three to six month intervals, that demonstrates one or more of the following: a fall in total lung capacity (TLC) of 10 percent or more; a fall in forced vital capacity (FVC) of 15 percent or more; a decrease in diffusing capacity (DLCO) of 20 percent or more; or worsened gas exchange at rest (eg, a decrease in oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry of four or more percent) or with exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive radiographic changes, including: worsening of interstitial opacities, development of cavities, progression of fibrosis with honeycombing, or development of signs of pulmonary hypertension.</p><p/><p>Rarely, patients will present with severe enough initial disease that they should be started on glucocorticoid therapy without waiting for documented radiographic or physiologic progression.

The decision to treat extrapulmonary sarcoidosis should be based on the specific organ systems affected and on the degree of impairment identified through clinical and laboratory examination. Treatment of ocular, neurologic, myocardial, or renal sarcoidosis or hypercalcemia is indicated even when symptoms are slight, because severe loss of vision, fatal arrhythmias, or insidious renal damage may ensue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The therapy of sarcoidosis affecting specific extrapulmonary organ systems is discussed separately.

For patients with shortness of breath on exertion and slowly worsening radiographic opacities, the lower dose is usually adequate. For patients with rapidly progressive disease and severe impairment (eg, oxygen dependent), we favor using the higher end of the dose range. </p><p>The initial dose is continued for four to six weeks and then the patient is re-assessed. If the symptoms, radiographic abnormalities, and pulmonary function tests (eg, spirometry, diffusing capacity, ambulatory oximetry) are stable or improved, the dose is tapered (see <a href=\"#H348701692\" class=\"local\">'Assessing the response'</a> below). Tapering schedules vary, but a common schedule is to decrease by 5 to 10 mg decrements every 4 to 12 weeks down to 0.2 to 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (approximately 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. </p><p>If the clinical and physiologic parameters are unimproved after four to six weeks at the initial dose, we continue that dose an additional four to six weeks. Most of the improvement with glucocorticoids is apparent in three to four weeks' time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>].

This level is continued until the disease is under control (usually 4 to 12 weeks). Once improvement is achieved, the dose is tapered as described for the maintenance phase above.

Alternate day therapy with prednisone has also been used for maintenance after initial daily therapy to reduce the risk of adverse effects from the glucocorticoids, but few data are available to support its efficacy. Likely, the benefits are comparable to similar doses of daily glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>During the maintenance phase, the patient is reassessed at 4 to 12 week intervals for evidence of symptomatic worsening or development of glucocorticoid-related adverse effects.

Frequently, a brief course of higher doses (increases of 10 to 20 mg above the maintenance dose given for two to four weeks) is required to relieve an episode of recurrent symptoms.

However, assessment of the benefits of glucocorticoid therapy in the treatment of sarcoidosis remains problematic for the following reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/29,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33,34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large number of patients with sarcoidosis undergo spontaneous remission or have a benign clinical course (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Long-term outcome'</a> below).

A prospective series of 215 patients with recent onset sarcoidosis examined the effect of glucocorticoid therapy in the first six months of diagnosis on the need for ongoing therapy at the end of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Among 95 who were not initially treated with glucocorticoids, only 8 percent were receiving therapy after two years. In contrast, of 110 patients who were on systemic therapy at baseline, 47 percent were on therapy after two years. One explanation for this observation is that treatment limited the body's innate ability to clear the disease, thus necessitating long-term therapy. An alternate explanation is that patients, who were not randomly assigned to treatment groups, were selected for therapy based on subtle indications that they had more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p/><p>The results of individual trials have been variable, probably due to variations in patient populations, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> dose, and duration of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/4,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,40,41</a>]. The best evidence in favor of glucocorticoid therapy for pulmonary sarcoidosis comes from the largest systematic review that included 13 randomized trials comparing oral glucocorticoid therapy (equivalent to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> 4 to 40 mg daily for 3 to 24 months) with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/29,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,34</a>]. The analysis found that oral glucocorticoids improved chest radiograph opacities (RR 1.46 [95% CI, 1.01-2.09]), symptoms, and spirometry. However, lung function test results could not be grouped for statistical analysis, and at least two of the trials examined found no improvement in lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids/abstract/16,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,29</a>].

The prednisone group received 60 mg per day for one month, then 20 mg per day for five months or longer, depending on clinical course. After 10 years, symptoms were improved in both groups and radiographic stage was not different between the groups, although the only subjects with a normal chest radiograph were in the untreated group. Spirometric values were not different between the groups and diffusing capacity improved in both groups.
