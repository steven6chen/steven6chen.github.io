Papillary and follicular cancers are considered differentiated cancers, and patients with these tumors are often treated similarly despite numerous biologic differences. The general pathogenetic, pathologic, and prognostic features of papillary thyroid cancer and its variants will be discussed here. The treatment of well-differentiated thyroid cancers and an overview of follicular thyroid cancer are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Overview of management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=follicular-thyroid-cancer-including-hurthle-cell-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Follicular thyroid cancer (including H&uuml;rthle cell cancer)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a report based upon the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1975 to 2012, the incidence of papillary cancer increased from 4.8 to 14.9 per 100,000 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107600\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107600 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 2012, there were an estimated 601,789 people living with thyroid cancer in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The age- and gender-adjusted incidence of thyroid cancer has increased faster than that of any other malignancy in recent years, with the increased incidence seen in both genders and all ethnic backgrounds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107601\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107601 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107603\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107603 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In women, however, the annual rate of increase has fallen from 4.2 percent per year from 1992 to 1999, and 6.9 percent per year from 1999 to 2009, to 2.2 percent per year from 2009 to 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The use of head and neck external beam radiation, commonly used to treat benign childhood conditions between 1910 and 1960, led to an increased incidence of thyroid cancer in the second half of the last century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-induced thyroid cancer&quot;</a>). However, since radiation therapy for benign childhood conditions was largely abandoned in the 1950s to 1960s, it is unlikely that the increasing incidence in thyroid cancer seen in the last 10 to 15 years is associated with childhood radiation exposure. Some authors suggest that the increase in thyroid cancer in the United States and elsewhere may be primarily due to an increased detection of small papillary cancers secondary to more widespread use of neck ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of very small thyroid nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>Although the increasing incidence probably partially reflects earlier detection of subclinical disease (ie, small papillary cancers), an analysis of the National Cancer Institute's SEER database found an increase in the rates of differentiated thyroid cancer of all sizes, including tumors greater than 4 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, incidence-based mortality increased between 1974 and 2013, from 0.40 to 0.46 per 100,000 person-years. These two findings suggest a true increase in the incidence of papillary thyroid cancer.</p><p>The usual female-to-male ratio of papillary thyroid cancer is approximately 2.5:1, with most of the female preponderance occurring during the fourth and fifth decades of life. Although the incidence of thyroid cancer is rising, death rates (0.5 per 100,000 men and women per year) have not changed significantly between 2003 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation exposure of the thyroid during childhood is the most clearly defined environmental factor associated with benign and malignant thyroid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Potential sources of radiation exposure include therapeutic uses of radiation (eg, treatment of childhood malignancies), environmental exposure secondary to fallout from atomic weapons (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">Nagasaki/Hiroshima,</span> Japan), or nuclear power plant accidents (eg, Chernobyl). In the past, ionizing radiation was used to treat a wide variety of benign conditions of the head and neck, although this practice essentially ceased in the late 1950s to early 1960s due to increased appreciation of the carcinogenic effects of radiation on the thyroid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-induced-thyroid-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-induced thyroid cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of thyroid cancer in a first-degree relative or a family history of a thyroid cancer syndrome (eg, familial polyposis, Carney complex, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 [MEN2], Werner syndrome, or Cowden syndrome) increases the risk that a nodule may be malignant. In one study, there was a 10-fold increased risk of thyroid cancer in relatives of thyroid cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a second report, the standardized incidence ratio for papillary cancer was 3.2 with an involved parent, 6.2 with an involved sibling, and 11.2 for a female with an involved sister [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Potential risk factors include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occupational and environmental exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis C-related chronic hepatitis (odds ratio [OR] 12.2 in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased parity and late age at first pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations or rearrangements in the genes encoding for the proteins in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway are critical to the development and progression of differentiated thyroid cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71801 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The importance of this pathway is emphasized by the finding of exclusive, nonoverlapping activation mutations in <em>RET</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/PTC,</span> <em>NTRK1</em>, <em>RAS</em>, or <em>BRAF</em> in as many as 70 percent of well-differentiated thyroid cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, thyroid-targeted activation of either <em>RET</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/PTC</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] or <em>BRAF</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] has been shown to result in development of thyroid cancer in transgenic mice.

Thyroid nodules come to clinical attention when noted by the patient; during routine physical examination; or when incidentally noted during a radiologic procedure, such as carotid ultrasonography, neck computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. Nonpalpable nodules (incidentalomas) have the same risk of malignancy as palpable nodules of the same size.</p><p>A history of rapid nodular growth, fixation of the nodule to surrounding tissues, new onset hoarseness or vocal cord paralysis, or the presence of ipsilateral cervical lymphadenopathy all raise the suspicion that a nodule may be malignant.</p><p>Regardless of how thyroid nodules are discovered, the diagnosis of thyroid cancer is usually made by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71385\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71385 \">picture 1</a>).

Microscopically, most are characterized by the presence of papillae consisting of one or two layers of tumor cells surrounding a well-defined fibrovascular core; follicles and colloid are typically absent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81310\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81310 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>The morphologic diagnosis is based upon an aggregate of typical cytologic features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71385\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71385 \">picture 1</a>), none by itself pathognomonic of papillary cancer. The nuclei are large, oval, and appear crowded and overlapping on microscopic sections. They may contain hypodense powdery chromatin, cytoplasmic pseudoinclusions due to a redundant nuclear membrane, or nuclear grooves.</p><p>Approximately one-half of papillary cancers contain calcified psammoma bodies, the scarred remnants of tumor papillae that presumably infarcted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72821\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72821 \">picture 3</a>). Inflammatory cells may surround or infiltrate areas of malignant growth, although this does not usually indicate the presence of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease).</p><p>Papillary thyroid cancer is often multifocal. In some cases, this represents intraglandular metastases from the primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, in one study of 10 women with multifocal papillary cancer, individual tumor foci were shown to have independent clonal origins in 5 of the 10 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In a second study, discordant patterns of <em>BRAF</em> mutations were found in 40 percent of the multifocal papillary cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145637637\"><span class=\"h3\">Variant forms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variant forms of papillary cancer include the follicular variant; tall cell variant (a more aggressive tumor accounting for approximately 1 percent of papillary cancers); and insular, hobnail, and diffuse sclerosing variants.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Follicular variants</strong> &ndash; Of the several histologic subtypes of papillary carcinoma, the follicular variants are probably the most common. The incidence of follicular variant papillary cancer has been increasing, while that of the classical form has been decreasing. In a single-center study, nearly 40 percent of the papillary cancers were follicular variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and in a multicenter study, 23 percent of papillary cancers were noninvasive follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (NI-FVPTC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These tumors are characterized by small to medium-sized follicles, typical of follicular tumors. Cytologically, however, they display the typical features of common-type papillary cancers, including large overlapping nuclei with hypodense chromatin, nuclear pseudoinclusions, and nuclear grooves; most also contain psammoma bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72821\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72821 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Follicular variants have been divided into different subtypes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A noninvasive, encapsulated, well-circumscribed subtype (NI-FVPTC)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An invasive subtype with either invasion (capsular or vascular invasion) or lacking a well-defined capsule</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Based on the excellent prognosis of NI-FVPTC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,29</a>], the American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommended renaming the noninvasive encapsulated follicular variants of papillary cancer as NIFT-P tumors (noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This new name removes the word &quot;cancer&quot; from the description and emphasizes that this tumor can be managed as a neoplasm rather than a malignancy. While thyroid surgery is required to confirm the diagnosis of NIFT-P, therapy beyond thyroid lobectomy is usually not required (ie, thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] suppression and radioactive iodine ablation is not required) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Follicular papillary cancers with nodal metastases are more likely to have mutations in <em>BRAF</em>, while encapsulated follicular variants including both invasive and NI-FVPTC are more likely to have mutations in <em>RAS</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Furthermore, partially or totally unencapsulated tumors that have an infiltrative pattern of tumor invasion into the surrounding nonneoplastic thyroid parenchyma are significantly more likely to demonstrate lymph node metastases and harbor <em>BRAF </em>mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]<em>.</em></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tall cell variant</strong> &ndash; The tall cell variant form of papillary cancer is a more aggressive tumor than classical papillary cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. These tumors account for approximately 1 percent of papillary cancers and are typically associated with a V600E mutation in the <em>BRAF</em> gene (see <a href=\"#H4161631315\" class=\"local\">'Molecular characteristics'</a> below). They are characterized by tumor cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm that are twice as tall as they are wide. The primary tumors tend to be large, they are often invasive, and many patients have both local and distant metastases at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Among patients who undergo a modified radical neck dissection, up to 80 percent have lymph node metastases (half of which are microscopic), and even among patients with papillary microcarcinomas who have prophylactic central node dissection, microscopic metastases have been reported in 37 to 64 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

These microcarcinomas are found in 15 to 30 percent of thyroid glands at autopsy. This high frequency, coupled with the rarity of clinically detected papillary cancer, suggests that the presence of a single focus of microcarcinoma in a thyroidectomy specimen is likely to be an incidental finding of no clinical importance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the other end of the spectrum is a large, locally invasive cancer with distant metastases noted at the time of diagnosis.

In another study of 3965 patients with thyroid cancer (65 percent with tumors &le;2 cm), 10-year recurrence rates to the thyroid, lymph nodes, and distant organs for tumors &le;2 cm were 0.3, 1.9, and 0.4 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Recurrence rates increased with tumor size (for tumors &gt;4 cm 1.9, 8.1, and 3.4 percent, respectively). Mortality was low in both groups (0.04 and 0.4 percent, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Soft-tissue invasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When present, soft-tissue invasion increases the risk of death fivefold. It can also cause substantial morbidity if there is involvement of the trachea, esophagus, recurrent laryngeal nerves, or the spinal cord. It is important to note that it is gross soft-tissue invasion (usually described as extrathyroidal extension) identified on clinical examination, intraoperatively, or on imaging that conveys an increased risk of mortality. Extrathyroidal extension that is only identified on histopathologic examination is not a major factor for mortality, as reflected in the changes in the eighth edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system where minor extrathyroidal extension no longer upstages a patient to stage III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110635 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Distant metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of survival in patients with distant metastases is variable, depending upon the site of metastases. Among patients with small pulmonary metastases but no other metastases outside of the neck, the 10-year survival rate is 30 to 50 percent; even higher survival rates have been reported in patients whose pulmonary metastases were detected only by radioiodine imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Conversely, the median survival of patients with brain metastases is only approximately one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>In multivariate analysis, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positivity was the most powerful predictor of death in a large cohort of patients with metastatic disease. Patients with large-volume, intense FDG uptake had a three-year, disease-specific survival less than 50 percent from the time of the positron emission tomography (PET) scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This may be due in part to lower radioiodine avidity in papillary cancers demonstrating a high FDG uptake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H612252231\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic subtype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have demonstrated a poorer prognosis for specific subtypes of papillary thyroid cancers, including tall cell, insular, and hobnail variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/36,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,51</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H145637637\" class=\"local\">'Variant forms'</a> above.)</p><p>In one study of 62 patients with the tall cell variant of papillary cancer without extrathyroidal extension at presentation, prognosis was still worse compared with classic papillary cancer; 6.4 percent developed distant metastases versus none of the patients in a comparison group with classic papillary cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, among patients without initial lymph node metastases or extrathyroidal invasion, no one developed metastatic disease.</p><p>Patients with aggressive histologic subtypes are usually treated more aggressively than are those with common-type papillary cancer of the same stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52272 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-overview-of-management#H2272967712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Risk classification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4161631315\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the traditional histopathologic risk factors, specific molecular profiles (eg, <em>BRAF</em>, telomerase reverse transcriptase [<em>TERT]</em>) may be used to predict risk of extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastases, and even distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. While these observations need further validation, it is likely that the specific molecular profile of the primary tumor may have significant prognostic value that could be incorporated into stratification systems.</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort of low-risk patients with intrathyroidal papillary thyroid cancer (&lt;4 cm, N0, M0; 33 percent with <em>BRAF</em> mutation), the overall risk of having structural disease recurrence over five years of follow-up was 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutated tumors had a recurrence rate of 8 percent (8 of 106) compared with only 1 percent (2 of 213) in <em>BRAF</em> negative tumors. Furthermore, in multivariate analysis, the only clinicopathologically significant predictor of persistent disease after five years of follow-up was the presence of mutated <em>BRAF</em> V600E.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>TERT</em> mutations have been described in 7 to 22 percent of papillary and 14 to 17 percent of follicular thyroid cancer but with a significantly higher prevalence in aggressive thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-59</a>]. In the largest reported series (332 papillary and 70 follicular thyroid cancer followed on average for eight years), <em>TERT</em> mutation was an independent predictor of persistent disease (odds ratio [OR] 4.68, 95% CI 1.54-14.27) and mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 10.35, 95% CI 2.01-53.24) for well-differentiated thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (<em>VEGF</em>, a potent stimulator of endothelial cell proliferation) in thyroid cancer specimens may help predict the presence of metastases. As an example, in a retrospective study of 19 patients with papillary cancer, a high level of immunostaining for VEGF correlated with a high risk of metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In a second report, elevated preoperative serum VEGF-C concentrations were an independent risk factor for nodal metastases and advanced tumor stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p>A broader genetic analysis may provide more accurate tumor prognostication. Specifically, a growing body of data suggest that a more aggressive clinical course can be expected in tumors that carry (1) <em>BRAF</em> V600E in combination with other driver oncogenic mutations such as <em>PIK3CA</em>, <em>TP53</em>, <em>AKT1</em>, or <em>RET</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/PTC</span> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]; (2) <em>TERT</em> mutations, isolated or in combination with <em>BRAF</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/56,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,65</a>]; or (3) <em>TP53</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>These results, although pending confirmation in other studies, suggest that specific molecular profiles may eventually prove to be a useful adjunct to risk stratification.

Although in a retrospective analysis, the presence of a <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation was associated with thyroid cancer mortality (overall mortality 5.3 versus 1.1 percent in <em>BRAF</em> V600E-positive versus mutation-negative patients), the association was no longer significant after adjusting for clinical and histopathologic features, including lymph node metastases, extrathyroidal invasion, and distant metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. However, <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation does appear to have a significant interaction with important clinicopathologic risk factors as the risk of mortality was higher in <em>BRAF</em> mutated versus <em>BRAF</em> wild-type tumors in the setting of lymph node metastases, distant metastases, and age greater than 45 years at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3715062197\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other factors associated with a minor increase in the risk of either recurrence or death are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/papillary-thyroid-cancer/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multicentricity of intrathyroidal tumor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral or mediastinal lymph node involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater than 10 nodal metastases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodal metastases with extranodal extension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delay in primary surgical therapy of more than one year after detection of a thyroid nodule</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative staging, based upon the clinicopathologic features of each case, is important for providing prognostic information.
