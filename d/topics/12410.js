Anemia is caused by one of three broad mechanisms: decreased production of red blood cells (RBCs), increased loss of RBCs, or premature destruction (hemolysis) of RBCs. A combination of these mechanisms can occur simultaneously in some conditions.</p><p>The approach to a child with hemolytic anemia is discussed here. A broader approach to the anemic child is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178863723\"><span class=\"h1\">THE HEMOLYTIC PROCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After release from the bone marrow, mature, non-nucleated erythrocytes (red blood cells [RBCs]) generally survive for 100 to 120 days in the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-anemias-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the steady state, approximately 1 percent of the circulating erythrocytes are destroyed daily and are replaced by an equal number of new erythrocytes (reticulocytes) released from the bone marrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67042\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67042 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74294\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74294 \">picture 2</a>). The basic pathophysiology of the hemolytic anemias is a reduced erythrocyte lifespan due to premature destruction, ranging from nearly normal to remarkably shortened. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell survival: Normal values and measurement&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In compensation for a reduced RBC lifespan, the bone marrow increases its output of erythrocytes, a response mediated by increased production of erythropoietin. As an example, in adults with hereditary spherocytosis, the bone marrow can increase its output of erythrocytes six- to eight-fold. With this maximal response, erythrocyte survival can be reduced to a value as low as 20 to 30 days without the onset of anemia (ie, fully compensated hemolysis). The limits of erythrocyte production in other hemolytic states have not been determined, particularly in infants and children, but they probably are lower in infants than in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-erythropoiesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of erythropoiesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As a result of increased RBC production in response to hemolysis, the reticulocyte count often exceeds 2 percent, with an absolute reticulocyte count usually <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-anemias-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. When a chronic hemolytic process is present, hyperplasia of the erythropoietic marrow elements occurs, with reversal of the myeloid-to-erythroid ratio from the normal 3:1 to 1:1 or less (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F51478\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51478 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75057\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75057 \">picture 4</a>). In the severe, chronic hemolytic processes of childhood (eg, thalassemia major, congenital spherocytosis, sickle cell disease), hypertrophy of the marrow may expand the medullary spaces, producing bony changes, particularly in the skull and hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-anemias-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In addition, a hemolytic process may be inferred, in a non-bleeding patient, by the presence of reticulocytosis. However, reticulocytosis may also be seen in some non-hemolytic conditions such as the recovery phase after an aplastic event (eg, after transient erythroblastopenia of childhood [TEC]) or in a child with anemia caused by iron or vitamin B12 deficiency who is responding to treatment. The degree of hemolysis can also be measured directly via isotopic or non-isotopic erythrocyte survival studies; however, these tests are generally not necessary in clinical practice. (See <a href=\"#H2090886550\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell survival: Normal values and measurement&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hemolytic disorders are generally classified as either intrinsic abnormalities of the erythrocyte, or extrinsic processes acting on a normal erythrocyte (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64454 \">table 1</a>). These two categories are not mutually exclusive because some hemolytic disorders are caused by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms (eg, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH]):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intrinsic</strong> hemolytic anemias generally result from inherited or congenital abnormalities of hemoglobin, the erythrocyte membrane or intracellular enzymes. These include conditions such as sickle cell disease, the thalassemias, hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis, stomatocytosis, pyruvate kinase deficiency, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extrinsic</strong> hemolytic anemias are typically acquired and result from forces or agents that immunologically, chemically, or physically damage the erythrocyte. These include autoimmune hemolytic anemias, hypersplenism (eg, from portal hypertension), thrombotic microangiopathies, and many drugs, including oxidant agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dapsone</a> and nitrites.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4169494557\"><span class=\"h2\">Time-course of hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic hemolytic anemia is generally at least partially compensated by a chronic reticulocytosis as well as other adaptive mechanisms. Thus, patients may be relatively asymptomatic despite significant anemia.</p><p>In contrast, acute hemolytic anemia, as may occur in the setting of infection, can result in significant symptoms despite relatively mild anemia, due to the abruptness of the drop in hemoglobin level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRINSIC HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrinsic hemolytic anemias include hemoglobinopathies, erythrocyte membrane defects, and enzyme deficiencies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25094836\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoglobinopathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoglobinopathies are common causes of hemolytic disease, and include sickle cell disease, the thalassemias, and unstable hemoglobins:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sickle cell disease</strong> &ndash; Sickle cell disease (SCD) refers to any one of the syndromes in which the sickle mutation in the beta globin gene is co-inherited with a mutation at the other beta globin allele that reduces or eliminates normal beta globin production. These include sickle cell anemia (homozygous hemoglobin S mutation), the sickle-beta thalassemias, hemoglobin SCD, and others. Many children with SCD are diagnosed through newborn screening. The clinical manifestations of SCD are protean. The major features are related to hemolytic anemia, inflammation, and vasoocclusion, which can lead to acute and chronic pain as well as tissue ischemia or infarction. Splenic infarction generally leads to functional hyposplenism early in life, which in turn increases the risk of infection. These complications have a major impact on morbidity and mortality. SCD is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The thalassemias</strong> &ndash; The thalassemias are a group of disorders characterized by reduced or absent production of one or more globin chains, resulting in disruption of the tightly regulated ratio of alpha and beta globin chains. The thalassemia syndromes are remarkable for their heterogeneity, particularly in terms of clinical severity. Beta thalassemia major is a severe form of thalassemia due to homozygous mutations associated with absent (or very severely reduced) production of beta chains. The diagnosis is usually made through newborn screening or at around 6 to 12 months of age due to the presence of pallor, irritability, growth retardation, abdominal swelling due to hepatosplenomegaly, and jaundice. The laboratory examination shows severe hemolytic anemia with markedly abnormal hypochromic, microcytic red cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76666\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76666 \">picture 5</a>). The diagnosis is generally confirmed on hemoglobin profile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115337\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115337 \">table 2</a>), though DNA testing may be necessary for confirmation of the exact type in certain situations. The thalassemias are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unstable hemoglobins</strong> &ndash; Unstable hemoglobin variants are rare inherited mutations affecting globin genes (eg, hemoglobin Hasharon, hemoglobin Poole). Denaturation of hemoglobin leads to precipitation in the red blood cell (RBC), which causes Heinz body formation and both intravascular and extravascular hemolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790 \">picture 6</a>). Most patients present in childhood or adolescence with varying degrees of hemolytic anemia, and other manifestations of hemolysis (eg, gallstones, splenomegaly, hemoglobinuria). Initial testing includes routine laboratory studies for hemolytic anemia, review of the peripheral blood smear, and Heinz body preparation. Hemoglobin profile testing may identify an unstable hemoglobin, but some variants are too unstable to be detected by this method. Genetic testing is the most definitive means of establishing the diagnosis and characterizing the variant. Unstable hemoglobin variants are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unstable-hemoglobin-variants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unstable hemoglobin variants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1713996614\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythrocyte membrane defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Membrane defects include hereditary spherocytosis, elliptocytosis, and other less common disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hereditary spherocytosis</strong> &ndash; Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is the most common erythrocyte membrane defect. HS is generally considered a familial hemolytic anemia, although up to 30 percent of cases are sporadic. It presents with hemolytic anemia of variable severity, and spherical erythrocytes (spherocytes) on the blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70611\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70611 \">picture 7</a>). Splenomegaly may be present. HS results from heterogeneous alterations in one of six genes (most often the ankyrin gene) that encode for proteins involved in vertical associations that tie the membrane skeleton to the lipid bilayer. Patients may present in the neonatal period with hyperbilirubinemia or during childhood or adulthood with splenomegaly or chronic anemia. Patients are at risk for acute exacerbations of the anemia due to an aplastic, hemolytic, or megaloblastic crisis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Diagnostic evaluation includes family history, routine laboratory studies for hemolytic anemia, review of the peripheral blood smear, and direct antiglobulin test [DAT] (to exclude autoimmune hemolytic anemia). Osmotic fragility studies are typically abnormal, but the test lacks specificity for HS. More recently, the eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) <span class=\"nowrap\">binding/RBC</span> band 3 flow cytometry has become available in specialized laboratories. This test has much higher sensitivity and specificity for HS than osmotic fragility testing. In a newborn infant, differentiating HS from hemolytic disease secondary to ABO incompatibility may be difficult. A period of observation may be necessary to clarify the diagnosis. Splenectomy can be considered for moderate to severe disease and almost invariably produces a clinical cure. Due to the associated risks, this procedure is generally deferred until after six years of age if possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">HS is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-spherocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary spherocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hereditary elliptocytosis</strong> &ndash; Hereditary elliptocytosis (HE; also called hereditary ovalocytosis) is a heterogeneous group of inherited erythrocyte disorders, most of which are autosomal dominant, that have in common the presence of elongated, oval, or elliptically shaped RBCs on the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63129\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63129 \">picture 8</a>). The morphology of the erythrocytes is the most important diagnostic feature of HE. Hemolytic anemia in these disorders ranges from absent to life-threatening. The most severe form of HE is hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. HE is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-elliptocytosis-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary elliptocytosis and related disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hereditary stomatocytosis and hereditary xerocytosis</strong> &ndash; Hereditary stomatocytosis and hereditary xerocytosis are rare inherited disorders with altered RBC volume caused by mutations affecting ion channels. They may be completely asymptomatic or they can present with chronic hemolytic anemia of varying severity. Hereditary stomatocytosis is associated with stomatocytes on the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75535 \">picture 9</a>), and hereditary xerocytosis is associated with xerocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62761\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62761 \">picture 10</a>). Splenectomy in patients with these disorders has been associated with severe complications (eg, pulmonary hypertension and thromboembolic events) and it is therefore reserved as a last resort for patients with severe hemolysis. Hereditary stomatocytosis and hereditary xerocytosis are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stomatocytosis-and-xerocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stomatocytosis and xerocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Enzyme deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemolytic anemias caused by inherited enzyme deficiencies include those in the hexose monophosphate shunt and glutathione pathways (eg, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD], glutathione synthase) and those in the glycolytic pathway (eg, pyruvate kinase, hexokinase, glucose phosphate isomerase, and others). Most are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders. Most of these conditions are mild and uncommon, with the exception of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. These disorders are reviewed briefly here, and more detail is provided in linked topic reviews.</p><p>This group of congenital hemolytic anemias are classified as &quot;nonspherocytic&quot; because spherocytic erythrocytes are generally absent and osmotic fragility testing is normal. A diagnosis is established by demonstrating reduction of the enzyme as well as decreased levels of glycolytic metabolites downstream of the deficient enzyme. However, testing can be challenging in the setting of acute hemolysis due to the higher enzyme levels of surviving erythrocytes. Deficiencies of glycolytic enzymes compromise adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. The metabolic energy requirements of the erythrocytes cannot be met, and the erythrocyte lifespan is shortened. Deficiencies of the enzymes in the glutathione pathway result in inadequate levels of glutathione in erythrocytes which impairs the ability to handle oxidant stress. In this setting, hemoglobin becomes denatured and precipitates into erythrocyte inclusions called Heinz bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790 \">picture 6</a>). These bodies damage the erythrocyte membrane, resulting in acute intravascular and extravascular hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-anemias-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency</strong> &ndash; Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common erythrocyte enzyme disorder, affecting &gt;400 million people worldwide. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked inherited condition that can result in a spectrum of clinical severity:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Class II and III variants are quite common and typically mild. These variants lack chronic anemia and reticulocytosis but can lead to <strong>acute</strong> hemolytic episodes induced by infection or certain drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74254 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Class I variants are rare and result in a severe chronic, nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia with acute worsening after exposure to oxidant stress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinical manifestations of G6PD deficiency depend upon the severity of the deficiency as well as the inciting event. G6PD deficiency is diagnosed by detection of decreased enzyme activity in red cells. A number of screening tests are available for this purpose; however, false negative results can occur during or immediately following an episode of hemolysis and therefore retesting at a later date is advised if clinical suspicion persists. &quot;Bite cells&quot; and Heinz bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73790\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73790 \">picture 6</a>) may be seen after an acute episode of hemolysis. Transfusion may be necessary in cases of severe hemolysis and symptomatic anemia. There is no specific treatment for subjects with Class I variants who have chronic hemolysis. Avoidance of known triggers including oxidant agents is an important aspect of management. G6PD deficiency is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and pathophysiology of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pyruvate kinase deficiency</strong> &ndash; An inherited deficiency of pyruvate kinase (PK) is the most common of the erythrocyte glycolytic enzyme deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemolytic-anemias-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. PK activity, measured in the erythrocytes, is reduced markedly, but the enzyme activity in other blood cells and tissues is normal. The severity of hemolysis is highly variable, ranging from a life-threatening transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia to a fully compensated hemolytic process. Laboratory tests are consistent with the presence of extravascular hemolysis with a brisk reticulocyte response. Demonstration of reduced erythrocyte PK enzyme activity or genetic testing for a relevant <a href=\"http://www.omim.org/entry/609712&amp;token=G+kOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S90woi3v7XcjNOWY5+bSTAWLxvG3XGFHYMS+4YVwlYsxk&amp;TOPIC_ID=5932\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">PKLR</a> gene mutation is required for making a specific diagnosis. Treatment of PK deficiency depends upon the time when the disorder becomes evident. Phototherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exchange transfusion may be needed for severe hyperbilirubinemia during the neonatal period. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Folic acid</a> supplementation is generally given prophylactically to avoid the development of folic acid deficiency. No treatment is needed if hemolysis is fully compensated (ie, minimal or no anemia). In those with severe, symptomatic anemia, splenectomy is an option for reducing symptoms and the frequency of red cell transfusions. PK deficiency is discussed in greater detail separately.

They include deficiencies of hexokinase, glucose phosphate isomerase, phosphofructokinase, aldolase, triose phosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphoglycerate kinase, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate mutase, monophosphoglycerate mutase, enolase, and lactate dehydrogenase. These diseases are extremely rare and most are transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern. Some of them, as listed below, are associated with neurologic disease, metabolic myopathy, and abnormal glycogen metabolism. Chronic hemolysis, often manifested in infancy, is a common feature. Specific erythrocyte morphologic abnormalities are not seen. Diagnosis depends on demonstration of reduction of the specific erythrocyte enzyme. No specific therapy exists; splenectomy may reduce the rate of hemolysis in some, but not all, of these disorders.

The diagnosis of AIHA is established based on laboratory evidence of hemolysis (anemia with elevated lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] and indirect bilirubin) and positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT). The degree of anemia and the reticulocyte response are variable. AIHA is classified as either primary (idiopathic) or secondary based on whether or not an underlying disease process is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57399 \">table 4</a>). In addition, AIHA is categorized as &quot;warm&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; based on the thermal reactivity of the autoantibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55710 \">table 5</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Warm-reactive AIHA</strong> &ndash; Warm-reactive AIHA is the most common form of primary AIHA in children, and is caused by warm-reactive autoantibodies, usually immunoglobulin G (IgG), that bind preferentially to endogenous red cells at 37&deg;C. This process leads to extravascular hemolysis that occurs mainly in the spleen, with resulting anemia, jaundice, and occasional splenomegaly. Warm-reactive AIHA usually does not resolve without treatment. Glucocorticoids are the first-line therapy for children with warm-reactive AIHA.
