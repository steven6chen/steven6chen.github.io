In children hospitalized at academic children's hospitals, the rate of transfusion of either RBCs or platelets is approximately 5 percent.</p><p>This was best illustrated at a multicenter study from the Pediatric Health Information System of hospitalized patients who were 18 years or younger between 2001 and 2003 cared for at 35 academic children's hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Of the approximately one million hospitalized children in this database, RBC transfusions were performed in 4 percent and platelet transfusions in 1 percent of the patients. The distribution of transfusion based upon age was as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonates (patients less than 30 days of age) &ndash; 18 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>30 days to 2 years of age &ndash; 23 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater than 2 years of age &ndash; 59 percent</p><p/><p>Increased severity of illness was associated with a higher rate of transfusion.

Although there are limited data on the hemoglobin (Hgb) level required for sufficient tissue oxygenation in normal children, data from animals studies and clinical observations of children with sickle cell disease suggest that a hematocrit of 20 percent (which corresponds to a Hgb of approximately 6.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> can be tolerated in otherwise healthy children without adverse consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>In both children and adults, clinicians have sought a &quot;transfusion trigger,&quot; an absolute Hgb or hematocrit value below which the patient needs RBC transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, assigning an absolute level is difficult since the Hgb level at which transfusion is required varies with the clinical setting (eg, acute or chronic) and physiologic status of the patient. In addition, the physiologic response to anemia in children is different from adults. In children, dyspnea, impaired consciousness, and other symptoms of hemodynamic compromise may not appear until the Hgb is &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (hematocrit &lt;18 percent) if the anemia has developed slowly. In stable, critically ill children, a Hgb threshold of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (hematocrit of 21 percent) has been used to decrease transfusion requirements without increasing adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Infants and children &gt;4 months of age'</a> below.)</p><p>There are few studies of RBC transfusion requirements in children except in certain specific patient populations such as children with sickle cell disease and premature neonates. As a result, guidelines for RBC transfusion in infants and children generally have been established by taking standards from adult patients and modifying them according to clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. General RBC transfusion guidelines are based principally upon patient's age and clinical status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2020900\"><span class=\"h2\">Newborns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common reasons for RBC transfusion in neonates include alloimmune hemolytic disease, perinatal blood loss, anemia of prematurity, and iatrogenic withdrawal of blood for laboratory testing.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-anemia#H97174663\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with anemia&quot;, section on 'Age of patient'</a>.)</p><p>In infants one through three months of age with signs and symptoms of anemia (eg, poor feeding, irritability, poor weight gain, tachycardia), transfusion is generally indicated if the hematocrit is &lt;20 percent (Hgb &lt;6.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and reticulocyte count is low (ie, &lt;2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Transfusion at higher hematocrit levels may be warranted in premature infants and those with cyanotic congenital heart disease. The decision to transfuse in the setting of anemia of prematurity is based upon the degree of symptoms and requirement for respiratory support. Management of the anemia of prematurity is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-prematurity#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of prematurity&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Infants and children &gt;4 months of age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The guidelines for RBC transfusion in children &ge;4 months of age are similar to those used in adults. In general, RBC transfusion is recommended for Hgb levels &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (hematocrit &lt;21 percent), since most children have symptoms of anemia at this level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In children with Hgb concentrations &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (hematocrit &gt;30 percent), transfusion is generally not indicated. In patients with Hgb levels between 7 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (hematocrit 21 to 30 percent), the decision to transfuse is dependent upon the clinical situation.</p><p>When deciding on whether to transfuse, the following factors should be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acuity of anemia</strong> &ndash; Chronically anemic children often tolerate Hgb concentrations as low as 6 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (hematocrit 18 to 21 percent) because they are able to maintain adequate intravascular volume and tissue oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. On the other hand, patients with an acute loss of blood and hypovolemia often require transfusion regardless of their level of Hgb or hematocrit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary and cardiac function</strong> &ndash; Transfusion may be warranted in unstable anemic pediatric patients with compromised cardiopulmonary status. In this setting, the need for transfusion is determined by clinical parameters rather than the patient&rsquo;s Hgb level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In stabilized (ie, not hypotensive and not requiring escalating cardiovascular treatments) critically ill children, a restrictive transfusion strategy (Hgb threshold of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> compared with a liberal strategy (Hgb threshold of 9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> decreases transfusion requirements without increasing adverse outcomes (ie, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome or death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; For children with anemia who are undergoing surgery, management prior to surgery should include evaluation for the cause of anemia and, if warranted, initiation of appropriate treatment (eg, if iron deficiency is identified, iron therapy should be initiated). However, this approach may not be feasible in emergency or urgent procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with anemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The decision to provide perioperative RBC transfusion should be individualized to the child and the clinical setting. For children with symptomatic anemia (eg, hypotension, tachycardia, myocardial ischemia) or rapid bleeding, transfusion is often warranted regardless of the Hgb level. In the setting of asymptomatic anemia, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) recommends a restrictive preprocedure RBC transfusion strategy (ie, transfusion threshold of Hgb &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL);</span> however, these guidelines excluded infants and children &lt;35kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Children with certain underlying conditions, particularly sickle cell disease and cyanotic congenital heart disease, require higher Hgb levels to safely undergo general anesthesia.

There is emerging evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy (Hgb threshold of 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for cyanotic and 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for noncyanotic disease) may reduce transfusion-related risks without increasing other adverse outcomes (ie, lactic acidosis, multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, prolonged intensive care length of stay, or death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. In a randomized trial involving 162 infants with congenital heart disease undergoing surgical repair or palliation, patients were randomly assigned to either a postoperative conservative strategy (RBC transfusion for Hgb &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for biventricular repairs or &lt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for palliative procedures <strong>plus</strong> a clinical indication) or liberal strategy (RBC transfusion for Hgb &lt;9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for biventricular repairs or &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for palliative procedures regardless of clinical indication) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Fewer infants required postoperative RBC transfusion in the conservative group than in the liberal group (48 versus 80 percent). There were no differences in in-hospital mortality (7 versus 6 percent), need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support (3 versus 4 percent), or median hospital length of stay (13 days in both groups). In addition, peak serum lactate levels and arteriovenous oxygen difference were similar in the two groups. Larger more definitive trials are needed before clear transfusion guidelines in this population can be made.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While hemostatic agents have reduced blood loss in adult cardiac patients, these drugs have not been uniformly useful during surgery for children with congenital heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-25</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Desmopressin</a> (DDAVP), for example, does not reduce RBC transfusion requirements in congenital heart surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].
