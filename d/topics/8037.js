Such conventional systems do not deliver a reliable fraction of inspired oxygen, and are generally poorly tolerated for prolonged periods due to inadequate warming and humidification of inspired gas. While commonly used in infants, the development of newer systems for adults that reliably deliver warmed and humidified oxygen at high flows through nasal cannulae (HFNC) has led to the increasing use of HFNC. </p><p>This topic review discusses the practical application and clinical uses of HFNC in adults. Oxygen delivery systems for infants and children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-oxygen-delivery-systems-for-infants-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous oxygen delivery systems for infants, children, and adults&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3092261240\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF CLINICAL BENEFIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms by which oxygen delivered via high-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) offers benefit are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F115105\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115105 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The major end organ effects are improved comfort and oxygenation. However, whether such effects translate into a meaningful clinical benefit (eg, reduced mortality or intubation rates) is unknown. Mechanisms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Small pliable nasal prongs</strong> &ndash; HFNC nasal prongs are generally soft and pliable. Consequently, several studies have reported improved patient comfort with HFNC when compared with conventional low-flow oxygen delivered through nasal cannulae or high-flow oxygen delivered through a face mask [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Warming and humidification of secretions</strong> &ndash; Warming inspired oxygen and heating it to core temperature is more effective at high flow rates (typically &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute)</span> than low flow rates. Thus, HFNC is better at heating and humidifying inspired oxygen than conventional high-flow systems such as Venturi masks or nonrebreathers (flow rate typically 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute)</span> or low-flow systems (flow rates typically &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute)</span>. Increased humidification results in increased water content in mucous, which can facilitate secretion removal and may also decrease the work of breathing and avoid airway desiccation and epithelial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Washout of nasopharyngeal dead space</strong> &ndash; Washout of upper airway dead space from the delivery of a large amount of oxygen can improve the efficiency of ventilation and enhance oxygen delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Thus, improved washout with HFNC, when compared with other oxygen delivery systems, permits a higher fraction of minute ventilation to participate in alveolar gas exchange. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) effect</strong> &ndash; Several studies in adults have shown that, similar to infants and neonates, HFNC increases nasopharyngeal airway pressure that peaks at the end of expiration (ie, &ldquo;PEEP effect&rdquo;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F115104\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115104 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>]. This &ldquo;PEEP effect&rdquo; can potentially unload auto-PEEP (if present), decrease work of breathing, and enhance oxygenation in patients with alveolar filling diseases such as congestive heart failure or the acute respiratory distress syndrome. As flow increases, nasopharyngeal pressure increases (ie, a dose effect) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The CPAP effect is greatest with the mouth closed. In general, every increase of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> of flow yields approximately 0.7 cm H<sub>2</sub>O of airway pressure when the mouth is closed and 0.35 cm of H<sub>2</sub>O when the mouth is open [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, the effect is mild to moderate, at best. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High flow rates</strong> &ndash; High flow rates result in minimal entrainment of room air when HFNC is used; this results in more accurate delivery of oxygen, especially when compared with conventional delivery systems. Patients in respiratory distress generate high inspiratory flow rates that exceed flow rates of standard oxygen equipment, resulting in entrainment of room air and a reduction in the delivery of the set fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>). The rate of flow in HFNC generally exceeds that of the patient, entraining very little room air and resulting in an FiO<sub>2</sub> that is more reliably delivered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/12,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17,18</a>]. However, similar to conventional systems, open mouth breathing or breathing during exercise will mitigate this advantage somewhat. High flow rates have also been shown to result in an improved breathing pattern by increasing tidal volume and decreasing respiratory rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased inspiratory effort &ndash; Increasing flow rates decreases inspiratory effort which is a linear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Carbon dioxide clearance is usually obtained at lower flow rates. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1033389248\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL APPLICATION AND SETTINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is being increasingly used to deliver oxygen to patients. There are no set recommendations for its practical application; thus, the suggestions below reflect our practice. Although HFNC can be administered on an unmonitored floor, in our opinion, it is best applied in a monitored setting such as the intensive care unit, intermediate care floor, or emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/9,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21</a>]. Our preference is based upon the rationale that patients in need of HFNC are at high risk of severe respiratory failure or mechanical ventilation, in which case a closely monitored setting is often needed. However, once the patient is improving and on a trajectory of reduced oxygen requirements (eg, 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> at 60 percent fraction of inspired oxygen [FiO<sub>2</sub>]), HFNC may be delivered in a less monitored setting. </p><p>Oxygen flows from the source, is heated and humidified, and is then delivered to the patient through wide bore nasal cannulae, which are generally made of softer, more pliable plastic than cannulae for low-flow systems. The cannulae fit snugly into the nares and are held in place with a head strap. &#160;</p><p>Two parameters need to be set:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The flow rate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FiO<sub>2</sub></p><p/><p>We prefer to set the flow rate first, typically at 20 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> (range 5 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute)</span>. The FiO<sub>2</sub> (range 21 to 100 percent) is next set to target a desired peripheral oxygen saturation. The flow rate can subsequently be increased in 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> increments if the respiratory rate fails to improve, oxygenation fails to adequately improve, or breathing remains labored. Increasing the flow rate and FiO<sub>2</sub> will both result in improved peripheral oxygen saturation; we prefer to maximize the flow rate first in an attempt to keep the FiO<sub>2</sub> &le;60 percent; however, an increase in FiO<sub>2 </sub>may be necessary to achieve adequate oxygenation. </p><p>HFNC is generally well tolerated and can be administered for prolonged periods (eg, days). Patients switch to conventional low-flow nasal cannula system once the flow rate reaches &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> and FiO<sub>2</sub> &le;50 percent. </p><p>In most cases, aerosolized medication is given directly to the patients with the HFNC in place using an oral mouthpiece (ie, nebulized medication is not delivered through HFNC equipment). However, aerosol delivery with HFNC in place is poorly studied and may not be guaranteed at high flows. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H929630549\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1978874441\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles of application</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygen delivered through high-flow nasal cannulae (HFNC) has been successfully used in several settings. However, the indications are not absolute, with much of the proven benefit being subjective and physiologic. Most data to support it are derived from observational studies using physiologic outcomes or from randomized trials studying heterogeneous populations (eg, preintubation, postextubation, surgical, medical) that include a variety of comparators (eg, low-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation). In general, results have been mixed and fail to consistently demonstrate an improvement in clinically meaningful outcomes (eg, mortality, intubation rates, length of stay). As an example, a meta-analysis of 13 randomized trials of patients deemed at risk of respiratory failure and intubation (postoperative and postextubation respiratory failure, and acute respiratory failure of medical origin) failed to demonstrate a decrease in the rate of intubation (10 versus 16 percent) or mortality (6 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Despite these limited data, HFNC is frequently used in practice. As a general principle, in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (eg, partial arterial pressure of oxygen:fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub>] ratio &lt;300 mmHg), we suggest that HFNC is an alternative to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other high-flow oxygen systems (eg, simple, Venturi, or nonrebreather oxygen masks</strong>) &ndash; HFNC is often better tolerated than oxygen masks due to enhanced patient comfort, reliable delivery of FiO<sub>2</sub>, and the potential reduction in the work of breathing. Choosing between these systems and HFNC should be individualized and depends upon clinician preference, institutional availability, patient comfort, and severity of hypoxemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-oxygen-delivery-systems-for-infants-children-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous oxygen delivery systems for infants, children, and adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-oxygen-delivery-systems-for-infants-children-and-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous oxygen delivery systems for infants, children, and adults&quot;, section on 'Nasal cannula'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-oxygen-delivery-systems-for-infants-children-and-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous oxygen delivery systems for infants, children, and adults&quot;, section on 'Masks'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Noninvasive ventilation (NIV)</strong> &ndash; HFNC may be used as an alternative to NIV or for the provision of adequate oxygenation during breaks from NIV. Choosing among these options depends upon factors including need for ventilation and positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) as well as patient preference and tolerance of the NIV mask. For example, HFNC is unlikely to provide sufficient PEEP for those who need it (eg, moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) and cannot be used for those who require NIV for ventilation (ie, hypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure due to hypoventilation). It is also unlikely to reduce the work of breathing as effectively as NIV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>HFNC does not have a role to play for those who are sufficiently oxygenated with low-flow nasal cannulae or those with an indication for immediate intubation (which includes failure of NIV). &#160;</p><p>Concerns have been raised regarding whether the use of HFNC can potentially delay necessary intubation and worsen outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As a result, when HFNC is used, clinicians should remain vigilant to signs of respiratory failure that necessitate intubation and mechanical ventilation. These include additional elevations of respiratory rate, the presence of thoracoabdominal asynchrony as early as 30 and 15 minutes after the beginning of HFNC therapy, and the failure to adequately improve oxygenation within an hour after the initiation of HFNC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Tidal volume was unchanged although end-expiratory lung volume and an estimate of dynamic lung compliance increased. &#160; </p><p>However, studies have failed to show consistent and convincing benefit in clinically meaningful outcomes such as intubation rates and survival. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of 310 adults with nonhypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure (three-quarters due to community- or hospital-acquired pneumonia), intubation rates were no different among patients treated with HFNC, standard oxygen therapy by face mask, or noninvasive ventilation (NIV; 38 versus 47 and 50 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, patients who received HFNC had a lower 90-day mortality (11 versus 19 percent [standard oxygen] and 25 percent [NIV]) and required significantly fewer days of mechanical ventilation (four versus six days [standard oxygen] and nine days [NIV]).

Although not routine, HFNC is an acceptable way to provide oxygen to patients undergoing intubation, both before (preoxygenation) and during the procedure (to prevent desaturation). Importantly, no delay in preoxygenation should occur while waiting for HFNC to be set up (which takes a few minutes), during which time, preoxygenation using other available means should occur.

Such patients are at high risk of respiratory decompensation requiring ventilator support as a consequence of the procedure. In a randomized trial of 40 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure who underwent bronchoscopy, there was no difference in peripheral oxygen saturation between patients who were supported with NIV and patients supported with HFNC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. One HFNC patient deteriorated and required NIV; however, three NIV patients required endotracheal intubation within 24 hours of bronchoscopy versus one in the HFNC group. The role for HFNC during high-risk bronchoscopy remains to be defined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-preparation-procedural-technique-and-complications#H1757948217\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Preparation, procedural technique, and complications&quot;, section on 'Equipment and supplies'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H867571760\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients tolerate oxygen delivery via high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC).

However, the risk of barotrauma is likely lower with HFNC than with noninvasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation following endotracheal intubation.

However, this theoretical disadvantage may be mitigated by the potential beneficial effects on improving ventilator-induced lung injury and thereby the progression of hypoxemic respiratory failure to ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heated-and-humidified-high-flow-nasal-oxygen-in-adults-practical-considerations-and-potential-applications/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H992304699\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systems that reliably deliver warmed and humidified oxygen at high flows through nasal cannulae (HFNC) have been developed and are being increasingly used for oxygenation in adults. Advantages of HFNC compared with conventional oxygen delivery systems include enhanced comfort, increased humidification of secretions to facilitate expectoration, washout of nasopharyngeal dead space to improve efficiency of ventilation, provision of a small positive airway pressure effect, and high flow rates to minimize the entrainment of room air for reliable delivery of fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>). (See <a href=\"#H3092261240\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of clinical benefit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HFNC is best applied in a monitored setting such as the intensive care unit, intermediate care floor, or emergency department. Oxygen is delivered to the patient through wide bore nasal cannulae. We prefer to set the flow rate first, typically at 20 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> (range 5 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute)</span>. The FiO<sub>2</sub> (range 21 to 100 percent) is next set to target a desired peripheral oxygen saturation. Further adjustments of both settings can be made depending upon the initial clinical response. HFNC can be administered for prolonged periods (eg, days) and patients can be switched to conventional low-flow nasal cannulae once the flow rate reaches &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/minute</span> and FiO<sub>2</sub> &le;50 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1033389248\" class=\"local\">'Physical application and settings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HFNC has been successfully used in several settings. However, the indications are not absolute, with much of the proven benefit being subjective and physiologic. In patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, we suggest that HFNC is an alternative to other high-flow systems and noninvasive ventilation. Choosing between these systems should be individualized and depends upon clinician preference, institutional availability, patient preference, severity of hypoxemia, need for ventilation, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). (See <a href=\"#H1978874441\" class=\"local\">'General principles of application'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common use is for oxygenating patients with severe acute respiratory failure (eg, partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub>] ratio &lt;300 mmHg) from medical conditions (eg, pneumonia). Less commonly, HFNC has been used to oxygenate patients before and during intubation, to treat and prevent postoperative respiratory failure, and to oxygenate patients during weaning trials and bronchoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H929630549\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications to HFNC include abnormalities or surgery of the face, nose, or airway that preclude an appropriate-fitting nasal cannula.
