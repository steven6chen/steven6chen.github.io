In children, any ureter greater than 7 mm in diameter is considered a megaureter based on measurements in fetuses greater than 30 weeks gestation and children &lt;12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Primary megaureter is a result of a functional or anatomical abnormality involving the ureterovesical junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59252\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59252 \">figure 1</a>), whereas secondary megaureter results from abnormalities that involve the bladder or urethra (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">myelomeningocele/neurogenic</span> bladder, and posterior urethral valves).</p><p>Primary megaureter in infants and children will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary megaureter is classified according to the presence or absence of reflux and obstruction. Management of primary megaureter depends upon the type of megaureter. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Postnatal management'</a> below.)</p><p>The types of megaureter are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refluxing, nonobstructed &ndash; This common variant is high grade (ie, grades IV through V) vesicoureteral reflux with a dilated ureter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67039\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67039 \">figure 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and course of primary vesicoureteral reflux&quot;, section on 'Grading'</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refluxing, obstructed &ndash; This rare variant is often associated with an ectopic ureter (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic ureter&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonrefluxing, nonobstructed &ndash; This common variant is also called primary dilated megaureter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonrefluxing, obstructed &ndash; This rare variant presents with symptoms or with a decrease in renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary megaureter is the second most common cause of hydronephrosis in the newborn (after ureteropelvic obstruction), accounting for approximately 20 percent of cases. The incidence of primary megaureter is estimated as 0.36 per 1000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Boys are affected more commonly than girls, and lesions are found more frequently on the left than on the right side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The reported rate of bilateral involvement ranges from 30 to 40 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51780\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51780 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of primary megaureter is uncertain. It appears to be most commonly due to an abnormality or delay in the development of the muscle in the distal ureter at 20 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This results in the formation of an aperistaltic segment, which leads to functional obstruction. Extremely rarer causes of megaureter include congenital ureteral strictures or valves.</p><p>The refluxing megaureter also has an abnormal ureterovesical (UV) tunnel that allows urine to reflux up the ureter during bladder filling, but more commonly during voiding when the bladder pressure is highest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and course of primary vesicoureteral reflux&quot;, section on 'Definition and pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary megaureter usually is detected on antenatal ultrasonography. The ultrasound demonstrates both hydronephrosis and a dilated ureter (&gt;7 mm in diameter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Affected newborn infants are asymptomatic and typically have a normal physical examination, urinalysis, and serum creatinine.</p><p>When the condition is not detected antenatally, children can present at any age after the newborn period with urinary tract infection, hematuria, abdominal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mass, or uremia, or be incidentally diagnosed during evaluation of other conditions. Symptomatic presentation is typically due to an obstructed ureter.</p><p>Both renal and nonrenal anomalies can be seen in patients with primary megaureter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Renal and urologic findings include ipsilateral ureteropelvic junction obstruction, contralateral vesicoureteral reflux, and renal <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoplasia/dysplasia</span>. Reported but rare nonrenal findings include ear tags, undescended testes, dermal sinus, tracheomalacia, and aortic aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography confirms the diagnosis of megaureter. If an antenatal diagnosis is made, a postnatal ultrasound is obtained to confirm the presence of megaureter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69128\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69128 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77164\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77164 \">image 3</a>). Although megaureter can occur with or without concomitant dilation of the upper collecting system, it usually presents as hydroureteronephrosis (dilation of both the renal pelvis and ureter). Ureteral tortuosity may be present. In many cases of primary megaureter, there is relatively increased dilation of the distal ureter relative to the proximal ureter or renal collecting system.</p><p>Ultrasound examination should be performed after the first two days after birth, preferably at one week of age or later, because hydronephrosis may not be detected due to physiologic volume depletion and relative oliguria. It is important to identify the ureter's origin and insertion into the bladder to help differentiate it from bowel and from an ectopic ureter. A normal bladder size distinguishes megaureter from lower urinary tract obstruction (eg, posterior urethral valves), which is characterized by a dilated bladder <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased thickness and trabeculation of the bladder wall. We still use the Society of Fetal Urology system to grade the severity of hydronephrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50549\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50549 \">image 4</a>), although newer classifications of hydronephrosis are presently being validated (ie, Urinary tract dilation (UTD) classification). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fetal-hydronephrosis#H75090646\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87049856\"><span class=\"h1\">FURTHER EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further evaluation consists of a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and diuretic renography to detect the presence or absence of reflux <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obstruction, respectively. These studies determine the type of megaureter, which guides the management approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Postnatal management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VCUG &ndash; A VCUG must be performed to detect reflux and any evidence of urethral obstruction (eg, posterior urethral valves). If severe reflux is present and the ureter drains poorly, the megaureter is likely a refluxing, obstructed type. If no reflux is detected, then diuretic renography is used to differentiate between the nonrefluxing, obstructed megaureter and the nonrefluxing, nonobstructed type.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretic renography &ndash; Diuretic renography (renal scan and the administration of a diuretic) is used to diagnose urinary tract obstruction. In our institution, we use 99mTc-mercaptotriglycylglycine (MAG-3 or MAG3) as a radiotracer and lasix as the diuretic (MAG3 lasix renogram). It is performed in patients without reflux, or in those with reflux and poor ureter drainage suggestive of a refluxing, obstructed megaureter. It measures the drainage time from the renal pelvis (referred to as washout) and assesses total and each individual kidney's renal function. The washout measurement correlates with the degree of obstruction. In general, a half-life greater than 20 minutes to clear the isotope from the kidney is considered indicative of obstruction. Spontaneous resolution of primary megaureter is less likely in patients with obstructed megaureters. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-management-of-fetal-hydronephrosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal management of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Diuretic renography'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A more complete description of the diuretic renography is found separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-ureteropelvic-junction-obstruction#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction&quot;, section on 'Ultrasonography'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior urethral valves (PUV) &ndash; On ultrasound, a normal bladder size distinguishes primary megaureter from posterior urethral valves, which is characterized by a dilated bladder <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased thickness and trabeculation of the bladder wall, and a dilated posterior urethra (keyhole sign). Voiding cystourethrography that demonstrates the dilated and elongated posterior urethra associated with PUV differentiates this condition from primary megaureter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of posterior urethral valves&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureterocele &ndash; Ultrasonography differentiates ureterocele from primary megaureter with the detection of a well-defined intravesical mass in the posterior portion of the bladder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ureterocele#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ureterocele&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unilateral ureterovesical junction (UVJ) obstruction and megaureter have a good prognosis. These fetuses can be followed expectantly in the prenatal period, without intervention or early delivery.</p><p>The fetus with bilateral UVJ obstruction should be monitored for oligohydramnios. Expectant routine prenatal management is recommended as long as the amniotic fluid volume remains normal. The antenatal management of hydronephrosis, and the management of pregnancies with severe oligohydramnios are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fetal-hydronephrosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fetal hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oligohydramnios#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oligohydramnios&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTNATAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials that provide evidence for the optimal management of primary megaureter in infants and children. The following discussion is based upon observational studies, and the experience and opinions of experts in the field. Management options include surgical repair versus conservative medical management. In general, postnatal management decisions are determined by the presence or absence of reflux <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87050292\"><span class=\"h2\">Management options</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87050306\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical treatment of the obstructed megaureter consists of excision of the distal obstructive segment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77319\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77319 \">image 5</a>), tapering of the dilated ureter, and reimplantation into the bladder using a reflux prevention technique. The success rate of this procedure, defined as decreased dilation on the ultrasound and improved function on the diuretic renogram, is greater than 90 percent, even in small infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>In a small case series, high pressure balloon dilation appears to be a promising approach to treat primary obstructive megaureter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; however, further studies with a larger number of patients are needed to confirm the long-term effectiveness and safety of this technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87050393\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conservative medical management typically consists of ongoing monitoring and antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These patients are followed by annual renal ultrasonography to monitor renal growth and hydroureteronephrosis. Antibiotic prophylaxis is usually prescribed until the patient is toilet trained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87050448\"><span class=\"h4\">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, all patients with megaureter received oral antibiotic prophylaxis (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin</a>, 12 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) because of the high risk of development of infection due to urinary stasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In most published case series, antibiotic prophylaxis was given routinely through the first one to two years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6</a>]. As a result, there are no data demonstrating that prophylaxis is beneficial in patients with megaureter. However, until studies show that antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated, it seems prudent, especially in severe cases of megaureter, to continue to administer antibiotic prophylaxis until the patient is toilet trained because of the increased risk of urinary tract infection. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H577588611\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical scenario</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonrefluxing megaureter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In nonrefluxing megaureter, the choice between surgery and medical management is based on the presence of signs and symptoms and evidence of impaired renal function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the asymptomatic patient with nonrefluxing megaureter and normal renal function based on diuretic renography, initial nonoperative management is warranted because, in most cases, hydroureteronephrosis resolves spontaneously without renal function impairment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77319\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77319 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3,5,6,9,10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6,9,10,14</a>]. Even severe hydroureteronephrosis, in some cases, can resolve spontaneously, although the time for resolution is longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Several studies have reported subsequent surgical correction in approximately 15 to 20 percent of cases without reflux because of new-onset of symptoms or renal function deterioration due to increasing obstruction in patients in whom there is no resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3,4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,14</a>].</p><p>Spontaneous resolution is less likely in patients with obstructive lesions confirmed by diuretic renography, as illustrated by the following case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 49 patients, spontaneous resolution occurred in 80 percent of nonobstructive, nonrefluxing megaureter, but only 20 percent in those who demonstrated an obstructive or partial obstructive diuretic renographic pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of the 16 patients with an obstructive or partially obstructive lesion, nine underwent surgical correction.

Of the remaining patients who were managed conservatively with observation, subsequent complete resolution was documented in 47 of the remaining 54 ureters (87 percent). In this cohort, multivariate analysis showed that perinatal presentation and a nonobstructive pattern on diuretic renography were associated with spontaneous resolution. In contrast, the grade of hydronephrosis was not predictive of spontaneous resolution.</p><p/><p>Based upon the currently available data, asymptomatic infants with nonrefluxing, <strong>nonobstructed</strong> megaureters can be managed medically with close monitoring. Surgical correction should be performed in patients with obstructed lesions. In patients who are initially managed conservatively, if hydronephrosis increases, renal function on the affected side decreases, or symptoms develop, surgical repair is indicated because it is likely that clinically significant obstruction is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69511\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69511 \">picture 1</a>). Surgical correction of obstructed megaureters improves renal drainage, as detected by a reduction in hydroureteronephrosis on ultrasound and improved renal function on diuretic renography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-megaureter-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

It is classified into four types based upon the presence of reflux or obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary megaureter is the second most common cause of hydronephrosis in the newborn (after ureteropelvic junction obstruction), accounting for approximately 20 percent of cases, with an estimated incidence of 0.36 per 1000 live births. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the pathogenesis is uncertain, it appears that primary megaureter is usually due to an abnormality or delay in the development of the muscle in the distal fetal ureter at 20 weeks gestation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary megaureter usually presents prenatally as a consequence of antenatal sonography. Postnatal presentation can occur at any age with symptoms due to urinary tract infection, hematuria, abdominal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mass, or uremia. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of primary megaureter is made by ultrasonography that demonstrates both hydronephrosis and a dilated ureter (hydroureteronephrosis). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further evaluation includes voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) to detect the presence or absence of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and a diuretic renogram that measures isotope clearance, which is delayed in cases with partial or total urinary flow obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H87049856\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging studies differentiate primary megaureter from other causes of hydronephrosis, including ureteropelvic junction obstruction, posterior urethral valves, and ureterocele. (See <a href=\"#H87049658\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no randomized trials that provide evidence for the optimal management of primary megaureter. The following management regimen is based upon observational studies, and the experience and opinions of the author.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> performing prenatal intervention or early delivery in fetuses with megaureter (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In symptomatic patients with any type of megaureter, we recommend surgical intervention to relieve the obstruction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In asymptomatic patients with nonrefluxing, nonobstructed megaureters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77319\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77319 \">image 5</a>), we suggest nonoperative management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This includes monitoring with annual ultrasounds and prophylactic antibiotics until the patient is toilet trained. Surgery is indicated if there is subsequent development of symptoms, or evidence of obstruction or impaired renal function. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Nonrefluxing megaureter'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In asymptomatic patients with obstructed megaureter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69511\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69511 \">picture 1</a>), we suggest surgical correction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
