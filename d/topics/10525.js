Prosthetic heart valves may be mechanical or bioprosthetic (the latter including heterografts and homografts).</p><p>Mechanical heart valves are associated with an increased incidence of thromboembolic events during pregnancy. Therapeutic anticoagulation throughout pregnancy is essential to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-risks-of-prosthetic-valves-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but given the absence of adequate prospective controlled trials and the differing maternal and fetal risks associated with various anticoagulants, the optimum anticoagulant regimen is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-risks-of-prosthetic-valves-during-pregnancy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p>Bioprosthetic valves typically do not require anticoagulation (unless there are other thromboembolic risk factors). However, bioprostheses have a significantly higher incidence of valve failure than mechanical valves. This is an important concern for young women, who must consider the potential need for future additional valve surgery if they have a bioprosthetic valve. (See <a href=\"#H2105070225\" class=\"local\">'Preconception evaluation and counseling'</a> below.)</p><p>Management of prosthetic valves during pregnancy is discussed here. Issues regarding anticoagulation therapy for a mechanical valve during pregnancy and pregnancy and native valve disease (including valve intervention or surgery prior to pregnancy) are discussed separately.

The baseline TTE enables assessment of valve function and hemodynamics, identification of valve dysfunction that may require treatment prior to pregnancy, and comparison if valve thrombosis is suspected during pregnancy. In some cases, the consequences of longstanding valve disease or comorbid conditions (eg, left ventricular dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension) result in prohibitive risks, and pregnancy should be avoided. However, many women with prosthetic heart valves can safely complete a pregnancy with careful management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-and-valve-disease#H10779046\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy and valve disease&quot;, section on 'Preconception or initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>For women with native valve disease with an indication for valve intervention prior to conception, counseling should include a detailed discussion of the risks and benefits of various options such as surgical valve repair, valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis or bioprosthesis, or percutaneous intervention. For patients requiring a valve replacement, discussion should include the trade-off between risk of thrombus and thromboembolism with mechanical valves (with associated need for therapeutic anticoagulation and related risks, particularly during pregnancy) compared with the longer-term risk of limited durability of valve repair of bioprosthetic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-risks-of-prosthetic-valves-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The patient should also be informed that some risk of life-threatening complications of valve thrombosis such as stroke (caused by thromboembolism) or valve obstruction remains regardless of the anticoagulant regimen utilized. Discussion of these risks should be included in counseling patients about future plans, including whether to forgo pregnancy.

They should closely monitor their menses and, if delayed, promptly undergo a pregnancy test. Women with irregular menstrual periods receiving anticoagulation and attempting to conceive should undergo periodic (eg, monthly) pregnancy testing. If the plan is to use therapeutic low molecular weight heparin for at least the first trimester, a plan should be made as to how this will be arranged once pregnancy is confirmed. Warfarin teratogenicity is discussed in detail separately.

We agree with the following recommendations based upon the modified World Health Organization (WHO) classification as described in the 2011 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for management of cardiovascular disease during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-risks-of-prosthetic-valves-during-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-and-valve-disease#H505126849\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy and valve disease&quot;, section on 'Modified WHO classification'</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mechanical valves are included in modified WHO class III, which indicates significantly increased risk of maternal mortality or severe morbidity. These patients require expert counseling and follow-up in a center with cardiology and obstetric expertise in pregnancy and heart disease. Anticoagulation monitoring is often best done in conjunction with a thrombosis clinic. Intensive monitoring including monthly or bimonthly cardiology and obstetric review is recommended during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with bioprosthetic valves are included in modified WHO class II, which indicates small increased risk of maternal mortality or moderate increase in morbidity. Cardiology follow-up at least every trimester is recommended, though more frequent visits may be required on an individual basis. </p><p/><p>Of note, patients with prosthetic heart valves with high-risk conditions such as severe pulmonary arterial hypertension of any cause or severe systemic ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30 percent, New York Heart Association functional class III or IV) are included in modified WHO class IV (instead of the above classes), which indicates extremely high risk of maternal mortality or severe morbidity with pregnancy contraindicated. If pregnancy occurs, termination should be discussed as it may be life-saving for the mother. If pregnancy continues, the frequency of follow-up is as for class III. </p><p>In addition to the above scheduled follow-up, a follow-up echocardiogram is indicated to evaluate the hemodynamics of the prosthetic valve and ventricular function in a pregnant patient with a prosthetic valve who develops symptoms (eg, dyspnea) or change in physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-risks-of-prosthetic-valves-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Elevated transvalvular gradients are expected during pregnancy due to increased cardiac stroke volume. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is generally the initial test to evaluate aortic and mitral prosthetic valves, though a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is required if prosthetic valve thrombus is suspected (eg, with obstruction or an embolic event) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-risks-of-prosthetic-valves-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, a TEE examination is suggested for patients with suspected prosthetic valve regurgitation if TTE examination is not adequate to assess the severity of disease.

Evaluation by an expert in pregnancy and heart disease is important for preconception counseling and to optimize management during pregnancy. The following risks of prosthetic valves may cause complications during pregnancy; among these risks, the risks of anticoagulant therapy and prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT; causing valve obstruction or thromboembolism) are major and potentially life-threatening issues for pregnant women with prosthetic (particularly mechanical) valves. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal and fetal risks of anticoagulant therapy to prevent valve thrombosis.

Management includes urgent Heart Valve Team assessment to guide the choice between fibrinolysis and surgery.
