Although clinicians may have variable thresholds for diagnostic testing, urine samples for urinalysis (dipstick and microscopic examination) and culture are generally indicated when the probability of a UTI is greater than 2 percent. Thus, they are appropriate in the following pediatric patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74329%7EPEDS%2F75971%7EPEDS%2F59396\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74329 graphicRef75971 graphicRef59396 \">algorithm 1A-C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76804 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-infants-and-children-older-than-one-month-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections in infants and children older than one month: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Decision to obtain'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Girls and uncircumcised boys younger than two years with at least one risk factor for UTI (history of UTI, temperature &gt;39&deg;C, fever without apparent source [particularly if the child will be treated with antibiotics], ill appearance, suprapubic tenderness, fever &gt;24 hours, or nonblack race)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumcised boys younger than two years with suprapubic tenderness or at least two risk factors for UTI (history of UTI, temperature &gt;39&deg;C, fever without apparent source [particularly if the child will be treated with antibiotics], ill appearance, fever &gt;24 hours, or nonblack race)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Girls and uncircumcised boys older than two years with any of the following urinary symptoms: abdominal pain, back pain, dysuria, frequency, high fever, or new-onset incontinence</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumcised boys older than two years with multiple urinary symptoms (abdominal pain, back pain, dysuria, frequency, high fever, or new-onset incontinence)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Febrile infants and children with abnormalities of the urinary tract or family history of urinary tract disease</p><p/><p>UTIs are an important cause of acute and chronic morbidity in children. Long-term complications include hypertension and decreased renal function caused by renal scarring. The accurate diagnosis of UTI in children is necessary to ensure appropriate therapy and follow-up for those who need it, and to avoid unnecessary therapy, hospital admission, and further evaluation in those who do not. The manner in which urine is collected and processed before it is cultured can affect the validity of the culture result.

In infants and children who are not toilet trained, transurethral bladder catheterization is the most commonly performed technique. However, suprapubic aspiration is least likely to result in a contaminated urine culture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H678706456\"><span class=\"h2\">Toilet trained</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who are toilet trained can provide clean voided urine samples for urine dipstick, urinalysis, and urine culture.

We usually perform TUBC in our patients. Although specimen contamination is more likely by TUBC than by SPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/1,3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5,6</a>], urine is also more likely to be obtained by TUBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Contamination of urine obtained by TUBC can be decreased by discarding the initial stream and culturing the subsequent urine stream during catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. Many physicians and parents also prefer TUBC because they view SPA as much more invasive and painful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H678706983\" class=\"local\">'Transurethral bladder catheterization'</a> below.)</p><p>SPA performed by a trained clinician is recommended for sterilely obtaining a urine culture in at least selected circumstances: uncircumcised boys with a tight phimosis or some girls with labial adhesions. While invasive and potentially painful, it represents the gold standard in the diagnosis of UTI because of the low likelihood of urine specimen contamination (approximately 1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/1,5,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,10-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Suprapubic aspiration'</a> below.)</p><p>The practice of obtaining urine specimens by the &quot;clean voided&quot; bag appeals to clinicians and parents because it is noninvasive. However, bag urines should <strong>not</strong> be routinely used to obtain urine samples for culture, especially in situations where contamination of the specimen will complicate further management (eg, young infants or ill-appearing patients who warrant empiric parenteral antibiotics) because contamination occurs in up to two-thirds of specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/1,3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5</a>]. </p><p>Bag urine samples may occasionally have a role for collection in well-appearing older infants and children in settings where urine catheterization is not frequently performed or when the caregiver is reluctant to have the child undergo urinary catheterization. In these situations, a negative urine culture result avoids bladder catheterization. However, given the high likelihood of bacterial growth, close follow-up with the patient needs to be assured and any growth on a bag specimen culture requires collection of a catheterized sample. Thus, presumptive antibiotic treatment should be <strong>avoided</strong> when a bag specimen is obtained. Any positive culture should be carefully interpreted in light of the individual clinical context and simultaneous urinalysis (if available).</p><p>Although use of clean voided urine samples for urine culture have been described in infants younger than six months of age, we do not recommend it because the technique has low yield (specimen obtained in about half of patients) and a contamination rate of 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It was also most successful in infants younger than 90 days of age in whom rapid and more definitive identification of a UTI is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2463845708\"><span class=\"h3\">Specimen for urine dipstick or urinalysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheterization or SPA is also the preferred method of urine collection for dipstick and microscopic examination of the urine in infants and young children who are not toilet-trained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>However, preliminary evidence suggests that a bag urine for a screening urine dipstick <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urinalysis may prevent the need for a catheterized urine culture in selected patients older than 6 months of age at low risk for a UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/5,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13-15</a>]. In an observational study of over 800 previously healthy, well-appearing children 6 to 24 months of age presenting to a pediatric emergency department for evaluation of fever, screening of urine obtained by a bag specimen reduced the number of subsequent urine cultures obtained by TUBC from 63 to 30 percent during the course of the study without prolonging length of stay or increasing rates of revisits or missed UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Follow-up for missed UTI in children who screened negative was only definitely known for 39 percent of patients. If a negative dipstick for leukocytes and nitrites on a bag urine specimen is used to forego urine culture, then close follow-up is needed to assure that fever resolves and no further signs of UTI develop because a negative urinalysis does <strong>not</strong> exclude a UTI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82157 \">table 2</a>).

For example, up to 85 percent of positive cultures from bag urine specimens represent false-positive results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Positive urine screening from a voided or bag urine sample warrant another urine sample for urinalysis and culture collected by TUBC or SPA.

In one trial that compared this method to standard clean-catch collection using no stimulation in infants younger than 12 months of age, suprapubic stimulation resulted in a significantly higher rate of voiding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, urine was obtained in a minority of patients in both groups and contamination occurred in about one quarter of urine specimens obtained by suprapubic stimulation.

However, this risk was assessed by the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on UTI in 1999 and found to be extremely low, and no change was made in the recommendation to perform the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Suprapubic aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although much less commonly used than TUBC, suprapubic aspiration (SPA) is a safe and effective method for obtaining urine specimens in infants and young children (usually not performed in children who are older than two years). The distended bladder, which extends above the level of the pubic symphysis into the lower abdomen, is easy to access percutaneously. </p><p>Success is more likely if the bladder can be visualized by portable ultrasonography, percussed, or palpated and the child has not emptied the bladder within 60 minutes of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/7,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27</a>]. Percussion or palpation of the bladder may stimulate urination in some children. Reported success rates for the procedure range from 45 to 65 percent when ultrasound is not used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] and up to almost 80 percent with ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urine-collection-techniques-in-infants-and-children-with-suspected-urinary-tract-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Although clinicians may have variable thresholds for diagnostic testing, urine samples for urinalysis (dipstick and microscopic examination) and culture are generally indicated when the probability of a UTI is greater than 2 percent.

We typically perform TUBC in these patients. However, SPA by a trained clinician is the recommended method for sterilely obtaining a urine culture in uncircumcised boys with a tight phimosis or some girls with labial adhesions and represents the gold standard in the diagnosis of UTI.
