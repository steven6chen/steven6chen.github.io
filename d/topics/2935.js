It is most commonly absorbed from cigarette smoke. A cigarette contains 10 to 15 mg nicotine and delivers on average 1 mg nicotine to the smoker. Nicotine is also available from smokeless tobacco (snuff, chewing tobacco), pipe and cigar tobacco, waterpipe tobacco, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), and a variety of smoking cessation medications. Nicotine is also present in some insecticides, which may be a source of accidental or intentional poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The peak plasma nicotine concentration during smoking is 10 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> with about 5 percent being protein-bound. The half-life averages two hours. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of nicotine is metabolized by lung, liver, and kidney; the principal metabolite is cotinine, which has a plasma concentration that is 10-fold higher than nicotine. Cotinine has a half-life of 15 to 20 hours and is used as a biomarker of nicotine exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Approximately 17 percent of nicotine is excreted unchanged in the urine. The rate of urinary excretion is pH-dependent, decreasing in an alkaline urine. Nicotine is found in the milk of lactating women with concentrations that parallel those of plasma.</p><p>Racial differences in tobacco-related diseases are not fully explained by cigarette-smoking behavior. Despite smoking fewer cigarettes per day, black smokers have higher levels of serum cotinine. A study comparing the daily intake and rate of metabolism of nicotine in black smokers and white smokers found that the tobacco smoke and nicotine intake per cigarette was 30 percent higher in black smokers, while total and nonrenal clearances of cotinine were significantly lower (by 10 to 15 percent) in black smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, both a higher nicotine intake and slower rate of cotinine metabolism account for the higher serum cotinine concentrations in black smokers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytochrome P450 2A6 gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interindividual variability in the plasma concentrations of nicotine and cotinine is considerable during smoking, even among individuals taking in similar doses of nicotine. Nicotine is metabolized primarily by the liver enzyme cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6). A number of CYP2A6 gene variants have been described, several of which are associated with slower metabolism of nicotine. Some individuals have been described with CYP2A6 gene deletions who metabolize nicotine unusually slowly and generate little cotinine. Gene variants associated with slow metabolism are more prevalent among Asians and blacks. Genetically slow metabolizers tend to smoke fewer cigarettes per day and are able to quit smoking more easily than fast metabolizers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nicotinic receptor genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nicotine acts on nicotinic cholinergic receptors, which are comprised of five subunits. The receptors containing alpha 4 and beta 2 subunits mediate nicotine addiction. The alpha 3 beta 4 containing receptors mediate cardiovascular effects of nicotine. Specific cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit (CHRN) genes, which encode the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits, that are associated with an increased risk for nicotine dependence, heaviness of smoking, and smoking-related diseases such as lung cancer, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms covering the complete family of 16 CHRN genes have been assessed in nicotine-dependent cases and non-dependent controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A significant association between gene loci and nicotine dependence (two distinct loci in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster, one locus in the CHRNB3-CHRNA6 gene cluster, and a fourth in the CHRND-CHRNG gene cluster) have been described. Each of these appears to influence the transition from smoking to nicotine dependence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking interacts with a number of drugs. Most interactions are caused by the effects of combustion products (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) that induce drug metabolism. Although some are mediated by actions of nicotine, the latter are primarily related to sympathetic nervous stimulation and catecholamine release. The following effects may occur with the cessation of smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is de-induction of hepatic enzymes which may require a reduction in dose of certain drugs including caffeine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentazocine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentazocine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, tacrine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increase in absorption of subcutaneous insulin which may require a decrease in dose.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nicotine is a ganglionic and central nervous system stimulant, the actions of which are mediated via nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Nicotine binds to nicotinic cholinergic receptors that are located in the brain, autonomic ganglia, the adrenal glands, and at neuromuscular junctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These receptors, which demonstrate diversity in subunit structure, function, and distribution within the nervous system, presumably mediate the complex actions of nicotine described in tobacco users.</p><p>The major cardiovascular effect of nicotine is sympathetic neural stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Central nervous system-mediated sympathetic stimulation can occur through activation of peripheral chemoreceptors, a direct effect on the brainstem, and effects on caudal portions of the spinal cord. The site that appears to be most sensitive to low levels of nicotine is the carotid chemoreceptor. Peripheral mechanisms include catecholamine release from the adrenal and direct release or enhancement of release of catecholamines from vascular nerve endings.</p><p>Nicotine also enhances the release of various neurotransmitters, including epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, vasopressin, glutamate, nitric oxide, calcitonin growth-related peptide, and beta-endorphin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some of these may contribute to the effects of nicotine on blood vessels.</p><p>Biphasic actions are observed depending upon the dose administered. The main effect of nicotine in small doses is stimulation of all autonomic ganglia; with larger doses, initial stimulation is followed by blockade of transmission. Biphasic effects are also evident in the adrenal medulla; discharge of catecholamines occurs with small doses, whereas prevention of catecholamines release is seen with higher doses as a response to splanchnic nerve stimulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SMOKING AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking is an important and established risk for myocardial infarction and other coronary events, including angina pectoris [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The mechanisms by which cigarette smoking accelerates atherosclerosis and precipitates acute coronary events are complex. The main responsible constituents are combustion products, including oxidizing chemicals, acrolein, butadiene, metals (such as cadmium), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulates, and carbon monoxide. Oxidizing chemicals increase free radicals, increase lipid peroxidation, and contribute to several potential mechanisms of cardiovascular disease, including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and platelet activation.</p><p>Nicotine may also contribute to acute coronary events. There are a number of ways in which nicotine can affect the cardiovascular system to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased myocardial work</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking repeatedly produces a transient rise in blood pressure of approximately 5 to 10 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. This effect is most prominent with the first cigarette of the day in habitual smokers. The hemodynamic effects of cigarette smoking are mediated by nicotine which also increases heart rate up to 10 to 20 beats per minute after an individual cigarette and on average seven beats per minute throughout the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=smoking-and-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Smoking and hypertension&quot;</a>). As a result of the increased myocardial work, myocardial oxygen demands and coronary artery blood flow increase. However, myocardial ischemia may ensue in patients with coronary disease, particularly in the presence of underlying coronary vascular disease when the coronary vasoconstrictive effect of smoking is superimposed. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Coronary vasoconstriction'</a> below.)</p><p>Despite these acute effects, habitual smokers generally have <strong>lower</strong> blood pressures than nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This is seen when blood pressure is measured after a period of nonsmoking, as is usually the case when a smoker is seen in the office or hospital. Ambulatory blood pressure recording shows that smoking increases blood pressure. The mild reduction in blood pressure in smokers may be related to reduced blood volume that is seen as a consequence of nicotine-mediated vasoconstriction and possibly decreased body weight, which reflects a nicotine-induced stimulation of energy expenditure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, a vasodilator effect of cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, also may contribute to the hypotensive response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary vasoconstriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In subjects with coronary disease, Doppler measurements of coronary blood flow demonstrate that cigarette smoking constricts epicardial arteries, increases total coronary vascular resistance, and reduces coronary blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-coronary-artery-pressure-flow-measurements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of coronary artery pressure flow measurements&quot;</a>.) Smoking also reduces coronary vasodilatory flow reserve.</p><p>Smoking has also been associated with an increased risk of vasospastic angina and poorer response of recurrent coronary spasm to vasodilator medication. Smoking can produce acute vasospasm during angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>]. These effects appear to be mediated by increased catecholamines since the acute increase in coronary vascular resistance can be minimized by alpha-adrenergic blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasospastic-angina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasospastic angina&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebral circulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of acute smoking and nicotine on the cerebral circulation are controversial. In an animal model, smoking a single cigarette produced a biphasic effect on cerebral arteriolar tone, resulting in both constriction and dilation; repeated smoking attenuated vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Vasodilatation is most likely an effect of nicotine, mediated, in part, by sympathetic activation, nitric oxide production, and potassium channel activation. Vasoconstriction is partially due to release of thromboxane A2 induced by cigarette smoke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypercoagulable state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking produces a hypercoagulable state associated with platelet activation, increased red blood cell mass, and increased fibrinogen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. Individuals who smoke have increased platelet aggregation, primarily induced by oxidants in smoke and possibly also promoted by elevated catecholamine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Fibrinogen, identified in the Framingham study as a predictor of coronary events, is increased and, in association with elevated red blood cell mass (a consequence of carbon monoxide-mediated functional hypoxemia), will increase blood viscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Upon smoking cessation, plasma fibrinogen levels decrease; however, the full normalization may take several years.</p><p>Thrombosis is a major factor in acute vascular events in smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death much to a greater extent than it increases the risk of angina pectoris. Support for a role for thrombosis comes from studies showing that smokers who died with acute myocardial infarction were more likely to have thrombotic occlusion at autopsy, and smokers with acute myocardial infarction have more extensive thrombosis and less severe underlying coronary artery disease compared with non-smokers. While oxidant chemicals are thought to be most responsible for smoking-induced thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], nicotine has been shown to increase the endothelial cell production of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which is a major regulator of fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Further supporting the role of thrombosis are observations from several studies that smokers who receive a thrombolytic agent for an acute myocardial infarction have a better outcome than nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/33,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36-39</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) II trial, the mortality at 42 days was lower in current and ex-smokers compared with nonsmokers (3.6 and 4.8 versus 8.0 percent, p&lt;0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest trial to evaluate the impact of cigarette smoking on outcome was the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) I trial, which included 11,975 nonsmokers, 11,117 ex-smokers, and 17,507 current smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Non-smokers had a significantly higher 30-day mortality than smokers (10.3 versus 4.0 percent). The lower mortality in smokers could be explained by younger age and less severe underlying coronary artery disease, both consistent with thrombosis playing a major role in acute myocardial infarction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-initiation-of-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Initiation of therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Also supporting the hypothesis that thrombosis is a major mechanism of smoking-related coronary events is the observation that smokers who continue to smoke after thrombolysis or angioplasty have a substantially increased risk of reinfarction or reocclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].

While the mechanisms of this effect are not fully understood, catecholamine-mediated increases in adipocyte lipolysis and increased re-esterification of free fatty acids by the liver are thought to contribute. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers have higher serum levels of triglycerides and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In the screening phase of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bezafibrate-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bezafibrate</a> Infarction Prevention Study Group, for example, the mean serum HDL-cholesterol level was 39.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in nonsmokers, 37.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.97 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in former smokers, and 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.91 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in current smokers of two packs per day or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Smokers may also have higher levels of oxidized LDL, which are believed to promote atherogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

It remains unclear, however, whether these changes contribute to the increased risk of coronary disease. Data from the Lipid Research Clinics trial in which almost 7500 men and women in 10 North American populations were followed for an average of 8.5 years, show the adverse effect of smoking on coronary disease appeared to be independent of LDL and HDL cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Smoking and secondhand smoke exposure also causes an increase in arterial lipid lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Endothelial dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking produces endothelial damage and impairs flow-mediated, endothelium-dependent arterial vasodilation both in coronary and peripheral arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], an effect that is partly reversible after smoking cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Some smokeless tobacco products, such as loose snuff and chewing tobacco, contain large amounts of sodium, part of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> alkaline buffer, enhancing nicotine absorption. The sodium load (30 to 40 excess mEq per day) could potentially aggravate hypertension and heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Some smokeless tobacco products contain significant amounts of licorice. Glycyrrhizinic acid, an active chemical in licorice, has mineralocorticoid activity, which may potentiate hypertension and potassium wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Among &ldquo;one-time&rdquo; users of snuff or chewing tobacco, transient (30 to 60 minutes) increases in blood pressure and heart rate have been observed due to effects of nicotine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Moreover, in data from studies in subjects with a history of tobacco use, the acute effects of smokeless tobacco products include an increase in heart rate and no change or transient increases in blood pressure. A crossover study examined circadian blood pressure and heart rate among cigarette smokers, users of oral snuff, users of chewing tobacco, and nicotine non-users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The nicotine-containing products (cigarettes, oral snuff, and chewing tobacco) were associated with significant increases in heart rate throughout the day but no change in blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23317125\"><span class=\"h3\">Mortality and myocardial infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Population-based studies have reached differing conclusions about whether smokeless tobacco use is associated with increased risks for nonfatal and fatal coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) Epidemiological Follow-up Study found no association between smokeless tobacco products and all-cause or cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. On the other hand, in two other United States studies, Cancer Prevention Study I (CPS-I) and the CPS-II, current smokeless tobacco use was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality as well as mortality related to coronary and cerebrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Some have minimized findings related to CPS-I because the data were collected between 1959 and 1972 when there was a greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>The overall estimated risk of cardiovascular disease in smokeless tobacco users also differs in two meta-analyses that include reports from Sweden and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. One report found that smokeless tobacco use was not associated with a significantly increased risk of heart disease (RR 1.12, 95% CI: 0.99 to 1.27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, in the other report, ever-use of smokeless tobacco products was associated with an increased risk of fatal myocardial infarction (RR of 1.13, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.21) and fatal stroke (RR of 1.4, 95% CI: 1.28 to 1.54) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The increased risk was attributed to the inclusion of the United States studies, which found an increased HR for all-cause coronary and cerebrovascular disease.</p><p>Data derived from the INTERHEART study, a 52 country international study, showed that chewing tobacco alone was associated with significantly increased risk for myocardial infarction (OR 2.23; 95% CI: 1.41 to 3.52) compared with those who never used tobacco [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Furthermore, smokers who also used chewing tobacco had the highest risk for acute myocardial infarction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4332938\"><span class=\"h3\">Stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from two studies (one from the United States and one from Sweden) suggest that smokeless tobacco product use is associated with a slight increase in the risk of stroke mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/73,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,78</a>]. The report from Sweden is supported by two meta-analyses that found smokeless tobacco products were associated with an increased risk of fatal stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. The methodology of these reports has been scrutinized since the smokeless tobacco product users had poorer lifestyle characteristics (eg, tended to be older, less educated, and consumed more dietary fat and fewer vegetables than nonusers), suggesting the potential for other unidentified confounding factors. Additional research is needed regarding smokeless tobacco products to assess the potential relationship between smokeless tobacco use and stroke risk in the United States population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630679574\"><span class=\"h2\">Electronic cigarettes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are little empirical data on cardiovascular events in e-cigarette users. With the exception of nicotine, potentially toxic compounds are present in lower concentrations in e-cigarette aerosol compared with cigarette smoke, and most cardiovascular effects are consistent with sympathomimetic effects of nicotine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=e-cigarettes#H1102655289\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;E-cigarettes&quot;, section on 'Adverse health effects'</a>.)</p><p>A small randomized controlled trial investigating efficacy of e-cigarettes as a tobacco-cessation tool found similar rates of adverse events associated with e-cigarette use at six months in 289 e-cigarette users compared with 73 placebo e-cigarette users (47 versus 49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. However, a small cross-sectional case-control study showed that e-cigarette users had heart rate variability findings and plasma findings that are associated with cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>Although e-cigarettes may pose a potential cardiovascular risk, particularly in those with preexisting cardiovascular disease, the risk is likely lower than the cardiovascular risk of cigarette smoking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION OF SECONDHAND SMOKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondhand smoke exposure is associated with an increased risk of acute coronary events, including acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. The effects of secondhand smoke exposure on the number and function of endothelial progenitor cells, plasma vascular endothelial growth factor, circulating endothelial microparticles, and flow-mediated vasodilation were evaluated for 24 hours after brief exposure of real-world levels of smoke to 10 normal volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Brief exposure not only causes acute vascular injury, as indicated by endothelial dysfunction and microparticle generation, but also leads to sustained changes of the vascular repair system with a mobilization of dysfunctional endothelial progenitor cells. Mechanistically, these effects are linked to an impairment in the function of or no production of endothelial progenitor cells. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that even a very short period of passive smoke exposure has strong, persistent vascular consequences.</p><p>Secondhand smoke may harm the vasculature not only by directly injuring the vascular endothelium but also by interfering with the vascular repair system, which may lead to chronic damage with recurrent exposures. These results indicate that involuntary secondhand smoke exposure constitutes a risk even at low levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">INSULIN RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Patients with insulin resistance have an increased risk of coronary disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X)&quot;</a>). Nicotine, most likely mediated via catecholamine release, contributes to the development of insulin resistance. This was illustrated in one study of 40 non-obese middle-aged men which found that the long-term use of nicotine-containing chewing gum was associated with the presence of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. There was a correlation between the extent of nicotine use and the degree of insulin resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY OF NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risks associated with nicotine replacement therapy in patients with cardiac disease have been of concern. Smokers and ex-smokers are at increased risk for acute myocardial infarction and other coronary events; however, establishing a causal relation between nicotine replacement and cardiovascular events is problematic since acute cardiovascular events are common in smokers and cardiac risk persists beyond the time of smoking cessation.</p><p>Nicotine replacement delivered by nicotine polacrilex gum (eg, Nicorette), nicotine lozenges, nicotine nasal spray, and transdermal nicotine (eg, Habitrol, Nicotrol, NicoDerm) have effects comparable to cigarette smoking with respect to increasing myocardial work. However, the risk of smoking while using nicotine replacement therapy appears no greater than the risk of smoking alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/6,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,85</a>]. The apparent absence of added risk may reflect both the relatively flat dose-response relation for nicotine and the fact that, even with continued smoking during nicotine replacement, the total intake is modest compared with usual smoking because the amount of cigarettes smoked is usually less during nicotine replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>The Lung Health Study cohort of 5887 middle-aged smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were followed for five years compared smokers with those who quit with or without nicotine gum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. There was no increase in hospital admission for cardiovascular events with nicotine gum treatment, regardless of the dose used. Participants who quit smoking successfully and used nicotine gum had a lower hospital admission rate for cardiovascular disease than subjects who did not quit smoking, regardless of whether or not they used the gum.</p><p>The results of two other controlled trials of nicotine replacement and one population-based case-control study of patients with cardiovascular disease also provided no evidence for an increase in coronary events with replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial of 584 patients (almost all men) with at least one diagnosis of cardiovascular disease found no difference in the incidence of primary cardiovascular end points (death, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and admission to the hospital for cardiovascular disease) at 14 weeks between the nicotine and placebo groups (5.4 versus 7.9 percent with placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Overall, the evidence suggests that chemicals other than nicotine are responsible for the elevated risks of myocardial infarction and stroke in smokers. The risks of nicotine medication in patients with cardiovascular disease, if any, are much lower than those of smoking, and the benefits of nicotine medication far outweigh the risks of continued smoking in such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351510472\"><span class=\"h1\">NICOTINE REPLACEMENT AFTER AN ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best strategy for encouraging smoking cessation after an acute coronary syndrome is not known. In an observational study of 663 smokers comparing those who were prescribed nicotine (n = 184) at discharge following acute coronary syndrome to those who were not (n = 479), there were no significant differences in the combined end point of death, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization, or re-hospitalization for angina, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmia at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-nicotine/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351510496\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT OF A SMOKE-FREE WORKPLACE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reductions in admissions for myocardial infarction have been reported where smoke-free workplace laws have been implemented.
