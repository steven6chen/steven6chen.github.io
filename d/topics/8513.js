(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During normal pregnancy, thyroid function tests should be interpreted using population based, trimester-specific TSH and T4 reference ranges for pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Total T4 and T3 levels during pregnancy are 1.5-fold higher than in nonpregnant women due to thyroid hormone-binding globulin (TBG) excess.

Specific findings on physical examination such as goiter and ophthalmopathy suggest Graves' hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H3166170\" class=\"local\">'Graves' disease'</a> below.)</p><p>When there is a clinical suspicion of hyperthyroidism, serum TSH should be measured. If the TSH level is &lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> free or total T4 (or free T4 index) should be obtained. If the free or total T4 is in the normal range for pregnancy, a total T3 should also be measured.</p><p>The diagnosis of overt hyperthyroidism during pregnancy should be based primarily upon a suppressed (&lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> or undetectable (&lt;0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> serum TSH value and a free T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> free T3 (or total T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total T3) measurement that exceeds the normal range for pregnancy.

Although hyperthyroidism from any cause can complicate pregnancy, Graves' disease (occurring in 0.1 to 1 percent of all pregnancies) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-mediated hyperthyroidism (1 to 3 percent of pregnancies) are the most common causes of hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other causes of hyperthyroidism (including silent or subacute thyroiditis, toxic adenoma, toxic multinodular goiter, and factitious thyrotoxicosis) are less common during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hyperthyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4267011769\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary objective is to differentiate Graves' disease from hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism. The two disorders typically can be distinguished based upon clinical findings and laboratory tests. In centers where expertise is available, ultrasound with measurement of thyroidal blood flow can aid in the diagnosis of Graves' disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical findings</strong> &ndash; Although the clinical symptoms are similar, the presence of goiter or ophthalmopathy on physical examination favors the diagnosis of Graves' disease. Goiter is not a classical clinical feature of hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism, but it may be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Graves' disease usually becomes less severe during the later stages of pregnancy due to a reduction in TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) concentrations or, rarely, mediated by a change in the activity of TRAbs from stimulatory to blocking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism may occur transiently in the first half of gestation and is typically less severe than Graves' disease. (See <a href=\"#H3166170\" class=\"local\">'Graves' disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12187099\" class=\"local\">'hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory evaluation</strong> &ndash; In situations where the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, TRAbs, using either a third-generation thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) assay or thyrotropin-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) assay, should be measured. TRAbs are positive in 96 to 97 percent of patients with Graves' disease, and therefore, the presence of TRAbs confirms the diagnosis of Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Imaging</strong> &ndash; In experienced hands, thyroid ultrasound with Doppler flow may be useful to distinguish Graves' disease (high blood flow) from painless or postpartum thyroiditis (low blood flow) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, its utility in diagnosing hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism is unknown. Thyroid radionuclide imaging is typically performed in nonpregnant patients to distinguish Graves' disease from thyroiditis. However, radionuclide imaging is contraindicated in pregnant women.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3166170\"><span class=\"h2\">Graves' disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Graves' disease is a syndrome that may consist of hyperthyroidism, goiter, eye disease (orbitopathy), and occasionally a dermopathy referred to as pretibial or localized myxedema. The terms Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism are not synonymous, because some patients may have orbitopathy but no hyperthyroidism, and there are many other causes of hyperthyroidism in addition to Graves' disease. Hyperthyroidism is the most common feature of Graves' disease, affecting nearly all patients, and is caused by TRAbs that activate the receptor, thereby stimulating thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion as well as thyroid growth (causing a diffuse goiter). The presence of TRAbs in serum and orbitopathy on clinical examination distinguishes the disorder from other causes of hyperthyroidism. The thyroid gland is usually, but not always, diffusely enlarged. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graves-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Graves' disease&quot;, section on 'The thyroid gland in Graves' disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-graves-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Graves' disease&quot;, section on 'Autoantibodies to the TSH receptor'</a>.)</p><p>The importance of measuring maternal serum TRAbs for prediction of fetal and neonatal Graves' disease is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-treatment#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-graves-disease#H2064595301\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of neonatal Graves' disease&quot;, section on 'Prenatal testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12187099\"><span class=\"h2\">hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During normal pregnancy, serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentrations rise soon after fertilization and peak at 10 to 12 weeks gestation, after which time the levels decline. There is considerable homology between the beta-subunits of hCG and TSH. As a result, hCG has weak thyroid-stimulating activity and may cause hyperthyroidism during the period of highest serum hCG concentrations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy#H994022\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroid disease in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'hCG and thyroid function'</a>.)</p><p>There are a number of examples of hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12187126\"><span class=\"h3\">Gestational transient thyrotoxicosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the time of peak hCG concentrations (10 to 12 weeks), total serum T4 and T3 concentrations increase. Serum free T4 and T3 concentrations increase slightly, usually within the normal range, and serum TSH concentrations are appropriately reduced. Thus, in some women, the high serum concentration of hCG during early pregnancy can lead to subclinical or mild overt hyperthyroidism characterized by slightly low serum TSH concentrations and high-normal or mildly elevated serum free T4 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This phenomenon is called gestational transient thyrotoxicosis (GTT). It occurs near the end of the first trimester, and symptoms (if present) and thyroid hyperfunction subside as hCG production falls (typically 14 to 18 weeks gestation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy#H994022\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroid disease in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'hCG and thyroid function'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12187133\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperemesis gravidarum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperemesis gravidarum is a syndrome of nausea and vomiting associated with weight loss of 5 percent or more during early pregnancy that occurs in 0.1 to 0.2 percent of pregnancies. Women who develop hyperemesis gravidarum have higher serum hCG and estradiol concentrations than normal pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; in addition, their hCG has more thyroid-stimulating activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Therefore, their serum TSH concentrations are often lower than those in normal pregnant women (60 versus 9 percent had a low serum TSH in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. A few of these women have high serum free T4 concentrations and, therefore, have overt hyperthyroidism.</p><p>Features that distinguish the transient hyperthyroidism of hyperemesis gravidarum from hyperthyroidism of other causes (which, in a pregnant woman, is most likely due to Graves' disease) are the vomiting, absence of goiter and ophthalmopathy, and absence of the common symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism (tachycardia greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute,</span> hyperdefecation, muscle weakness, tremor). In addition, serum free T4 concentrations are only minimally elevated and serum T3 concentrations may not be elevated in women with hyperemesis gravidarum, whereas both are usually unequivocally elevated in pregnant women with true hyperthyroidism from Graves' disease.</p><p>The thyroid hyperfunction in women with hyperemesis gravidarum usually does <strong>not</strong> require treatment, because it is mild and subsides as hCG production falls (as does the vomiting). Like the thyroid hyperfunction, the vomiting is also proportional to the elevation in serum hCG and estradiol concentrations, and it is thought to be caused by estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. If overt hyperthyroidism persists for more than several weeks or beyond the first trimester, it is probably not hCG mediated.</p><p>The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

A hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy) is benign but may give rise to choriocarcinoma. Both are associated with high serum hCG concentrations and abnormal hCG isoforms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-trophoblastic-disease-pathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational trophoblastic disease: Pathology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the past, approximately 55 to 60 percent of women with trophoblastic disease had clinically evident hyperthyroidism at the time of diagnosis, which could be severe. However, in a review of 196 patients from the United Kingdom treated for gestational trophoblastic disease between 2005 and 2010, biochemical hyperthyroidism was present in 7 percent and clinical hyperthyroidism in only 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperthyroidism-during-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-causes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The difference in prevalence is likely related to earlier diagnosis of trophoblastic disease due to ultrasonography and monitoring of serum beta-hCG.

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy should be based primarily upon a finding of a suppressed (&lt;0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> or undetectable (&lt;0.01) serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) value and elevated thyroid hormone levels (serum free T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> free T3 or total T4 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total T3) that exceed the normal range for pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H994499\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although hyperthyroidism from any cause can complicate pregnancy, Graves' (occurring in 0.1 to 1 percent of all pregnancies) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-mediated hyperthyroidism (1 to 3 percent of pregnancies) are the most common causes of hyperthyroidism. In situations where the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs), using a third-generation thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) assay or a thyrotropin-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) assay, should be measured. TRAbs are positive in 95 percent of patients with Graves' disease, and therefore, the presence of TRAbs confirms the diagnosis of Graves' disease. (See <a href=\"#H4267011769\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism mediated by the effects of hCG include gestational transient thyrotoxicosis (GTT), hyperemesis gravidarum, and trophoblastic hyperthyroidism. Only the last (trophoblastic hyperthyroidism) requires treatment of the hyperthyroidism.
