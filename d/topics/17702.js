Three distinct clinical forms of BL are recognized: endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-associated. Although these differ in their epidemiology, clinical presentation, and genetic features, they are histologically identical and have similar clinical behavior. All three clinical forms are generally treated in a similar fashion.</p><p>BL and Burkitt leukemia are classified as different manifestations of the same disease. Diagnostic criteria have evolved to incorporate immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and molecular diagnostic techniques. As such, many older studies included a heterogeneous patient population that contained many patients that would not be diagnosed with BL by current criteria.</p><p>The treatment of BL is presented here. The epidemiology, clinical presentation, and genetic features are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-burkitt-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oncologic emergencies and treatment-related hematologic toxicities are common in the highly aggressive NHLs. Physicians must always be alert to their potential presence, and be prepared to deal with them urgently and effectively. In particular, patients with BL are at high risk for the development of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Prophylactic therapy for and management of TLS is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-lysis-syndrome-definition-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-etiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor lysis syndrome: Definition, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, etiology and risk factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Oncologic emergencies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretreatment evaluation both determines the bulk of disease and provides information about the individual's comorbidities that are likely to have an impact on treatment options. In addition to a history and physical examination, it is our practice to perform the following pretreatment studies in patients with BL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hepatitis B, HIV, and uric acid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral bone marrow biopsy is recommended for all patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture is recommended for all patients but may be performed at the start of therapy if intrathecal chemotherapy is a component of the treatment regimen. Cerebrospinal fluid should be sent for both cytology and flow cytometry. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'CNS involvement'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnostic positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/computed</span> tomography (CT) examination should be performed prior to initiation of treatment, if possible. CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis are an acceptable alternative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Routine imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of cardiac ejection fraction (eg, echocardiogram or MUGA) should be performed if anthracyclines are used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, monitoring, and diagnosis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of anthracycline cardiotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men and women of child-bearing potential should receive counseling about the potential effect of treatment on their fertility and options for fertility-preserving measures. Given the urgent need for treatment with BL, options for women are limited, but men can often participate in sperm banking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment or gonadal resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>General approaches to the diagnostic work-up and staging of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are presented separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>).

This syndrome is best prevented via appropriate treatment with aggressive intravenous hydration, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasburicase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasburicase</a>, and correction of any prior electrolyte disturbances and elements of reversible renal failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57607 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-lysis-syndrome-prevention-and-treatment#H21712037\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor lysis syndrome: Prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Clinical impact of TLS'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard of care for BL has yet to be defined and our preferred treatment approach is to enroll patients in well-controlled cooperative research trials. However, for patients who are not candidates for such trials or for those who choose not to participate, we use aggressive combination chemotherapy with central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. Dose reduction should be avoided if at all possible and therapy should be initiated quickly. At our institutions, we aim to start therapy within 48 hours of encountering a patient with suspected BL.</p><p>As response to chemotherapy is rapid and disease is inevitably diffuse, there is no role for radiation therapy in BL, even in patients with localized disease. In addition, surgery is no longer employed in BL. Most patients with BL can be treated according to the method outlined below. Patients with AIDS-related lymphoma, cardiac disease, central nervous system involvement at presentation, and older adults require special consideration. Treatment of these patient populations is presented below. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Special scenarios'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with BL require intensive, frequent multi-agent therapy with adequate CNS prophylaxis. Less intensive regimens (eg, CHOP) used in other subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are not adequate therapy as they result in frequent relapses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, approximately 30 to 50 percent of patients will develop CNS relapse if CNS prophylaxis is not given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. With the incorporation of CNS prophylaxis, CNS relapse rates have dropped to approximately 6 to 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Chemotherapy regimens used for adults with BL have been adapted from those used in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. There have been no randomized trials and it is virtually impossible to compare regimens because single-arm trials have differed in their diagnostic criteria, staging, and age of subjects included.</p><p>There are three main treatment approaches that have been used in adults with BL. While initial studies did not include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> therapy, rituximab is now routinely incorporated into the treatment of these patients (beginning with cycle 2). The addition of rituximab to these regimens may improve outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Incorporation of rituximab'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive, short-duration combination chemotherapy (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">R-CODOX-M/IVAC,</span> CALGB 9251, <span class=\"nowrap\">GMALL-B-ALL/NHL2002)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72511\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72511 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76650 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/1,8-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ALL-like therapy with a stepwise induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy lasting at least two years from diagnosis (eg, CALGB 8811 regimen, R-HyperCVAD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67471\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67471 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infusional chemotherapy with dose-adjusted EPOCH plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F88411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88411 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p>Among these treatment approaches, for most adults with BL, we suggest intensive, short-duration combination chemotherapy rather than ALL-like therapy. This is principally because it is quicker and less complicated, and because we have more clinical experience with this treatment approach. Infusional chemotherapy with dose-adjusted EPOCH plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> is an acceptable alternative for patients who may not tolerate more aggressive regimens (eg, older or less fit patients). Details regarding the use of these regimens are presented below.</p><p>There is a paucity of data on these approaches in adult populations. An international retrospective analysis of 543 adult patients with BL (including more than 40 percent &gt;40 years old) examined clinical outcomes from prospective, non-randomized clinical trials that utilized intensive, short-duration combination chemotherapy or ALL-like therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The modest numbers of patients in most of these studies do not permit direct comparison of outcomes between treatment approaches or age groups. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">CODOX-M plus IVAC (&quot;Magrath regimen&quot;)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CODOX-M (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>) with IVAC (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, and intrathecal methotrexate), also called the Magrath regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72511\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72511 \">table 3</a>), has traditionally been the combination chemotherapy regimen most frequently used for the treatment of BL outside of a clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/13,14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,21</a>]. Given the toxicity of <span class=\"nowrap\">CODOX-M/IVAC,</span> some experts suggest the use of dose-adjusted EPOCH in older or less fit patients. (See <a href=\"#H7112340\" class=\"local\">'Dose-adjusted EPOCH'</a> below.)</p><p>One case series and three prospective trials have been reported on the use of <span class=\"nowrap\">CODOX-M/IVAC</span> in patients with newly diagnosed BL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/13,14,21,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,21,28</a>]. Dosing of <span class=\"nowrap\">CODOX-M/IVAC</span> has varied slightly between studies. All of these trials used a risk-adapted approach. In general, patients were considered low risk if they had non-bulky, early stage disease with a good performance status and a normal LDH. Low risk patients were treated with three cycles of CODOX-M. All other patients were considered high risk and were treated with alternating <span class=\"nowrap\">CODOX-M/IVAC</span> twice (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">CODOX-M/IVAC/CODOX-M/IVAC)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72511\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72511 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>All patients received prophylaxis for tumor lysis syndrome. In addition, CNS prophylaxis was administered with intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>. Patients with documented CNS involvement received additional intrathecal therapy. Patients could have received one cycle of a CHOP-like regimen prior to enrollment. Toxicity with <span class=\"nowrap\">CODOX-M/IVAC</span> is severe and virtually all patients require a prolonged inpatient hospital stay and blood product support. With this approach, reported two-year overall survival ranges from 67 to 92 percent, although among adults the rate is approximately 75 percent.</p><p>The following are the three largest reports of the use of <span class=\"nowrap\">CODOX/IVAC</span> in newly diagnosed BL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial report of <span class=\"nowrap\">CODOX-M/IVAC</span> from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) was a series of 41 patients (20 adults, 21 children) with newly diagnosed BL including 34 high risk and 7 low risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Low risk patients were those with a single extraabdominal mass or completely resected abdominal disease and a normal LDH. All others were considered high risk. Ninety-three percent completed protocol. There were no toxic deaths but severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> toxicity included neutropenia (100 percent), thrombocytopenia (96 percent), and mucositis (61 percent). Sepsis occurred in 22 percent of patients. The two-year event-free survival rate was 92 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective multicenter study reported on the use of a risk-adapted <span class=\"nowrap\">CODOX-M/IVAC</span> protocol in 52 patients with newly diagnosed BL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-burkitt-leukemia-lymphoma-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This protocol differed from the NCI protocol by the omission of an injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> on day 15. The trial included 12 low risk patients and 40 high risk patients. Low risk patients had a normal LDH level, WHO performance status of 0 or 1, Ann Arbor stage I-II, and no tumor mass &ge;10cm. All other patients were high risk. Approximately 80 percent of the patients completed protocol. Severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> toxicities were common including neutropenia (100 percent), thrombocytopenia (66 percent), mucositis (42 percent), and diarrhea (8 percent). Two-year overall survival rates for the low- and high-risk patients were 82 and 70 percent, respectively.

This trial included 11 low risk and 42 high risk patients. Low risk patients were those with a normal LDH, WHO performance status 0 to 1, Ann Arbor stage I to II and &le;1 extra-nodal sites.
