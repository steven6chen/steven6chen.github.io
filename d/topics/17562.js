The genus <em>Ebolavirus</em> consists of five species: Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, Tai Forest, and Reston. </p><p>The Zaire species was discovered in 1976 and has been responsible for some dozen outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and neighboring countries, with case fatality rates often approaching 90 percent. In 2014, the Zaire virus appeared in West Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], producing an epidemic in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone that took more than two years to bring under control. There were nearly 29,000 total cases (suspected, probable, or confirmed), of which more than 15,000 were laboratory confirmed, and the overall case fatality rate was approximately 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The Sudan species was also first recognized in 1976, and in four outbreaks in Uganda and Sudan, case fatality rates have averaged 50 percent. The Bundibugyo species has been responsible for small outbreaks in Uganda and the adjacent DRC, while the Ivory Coast virus has caused one nonfatal case. The Reston virus does not cause disease in humans. </p><p>Outbreaks of Ebola virus disease appear to begin when a human comes into contact with an infected animal or its body fluids. Subsequent person-to-person transmission is based upon direct physical contact with the body fluids of a living or deceased patient. </p><p>Patients with Ebola virus disease typically present with a nonspecific febrile syndrome that may include headache, muscle aches, and fatigue. Vomiting and diarrhea frequently develop during the first few days of illness and may lead to significant volume losses. A maculopapular rash is sometimes observed. Despite the traditional name of &quot;Ebola hemorrhagic fever,&quot; major bleeding is not found in the majority of patients, and severe hemorrhage tends to be observed only in the late stages of disease. Some patients develop progressive hypotension and shock with multiorgan failure, which typically results in death during the second week of illness. By comparison, patients who survive infection commonly begin to show signs of clinical improvement during the second week of illness. </p><p>The experience of the 2014-2016 West African epidemic indicates that the mortality associated with Ebola virus disease may be reduced through adequate supportive care. In the future, specific antiviral therapy may further diminish the morbidity and mortality of Ebola and Marburg virus diseases, and virus-specific vaccination may be able to protect humans against these conditions. </p><p>This topic will discuss treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease. Detailed discussions of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease are found elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H1056044081\" class=\"local\">'Infection control precautions during acute illness'</a> below.)</p><p>The mainstay of treatment for Ebola virus disease involves supportive care to maintain adequate organ function (eg, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal) while the immune system mobilizes an adaptive response to eliminate the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/1,7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-13</a>] (see <a href=\"#H344737195\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> below). Whenever possible, such patients should receive care in designated treatment centers and by clinicians trained to care for such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Treating patients with Ebola requires a multidisciplinary approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Several experimental antiviral therapies were used to treat patients during the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa, but their efficacy is unclear, and the availability of these drugs is limited. Thus, decisions about whether to use antiviral therapy, as well as the choice of therapy and the timing of administration, should be made in conjunction with public health agencies.

Fluid and electrolyte replacement can be administered orally (eg, World Health Organization [WHO]-recommended oral rehydration salts) or intravenously (eg, 0.9% sodium chloride solution); the approach depends in part upon the stage of illness and the clinical presentation. As an example, in resource-limited settings, oral therapy to prevent or correct dehydration may be suitable for patients in the early phase of illness who respond to oral antiemetic and antidiarrheal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, patients in shock and those who are unable to tolerate or manage self-directed oral replacement therapy will require intravenous fluids. </p><p>The approach to fluid and electrolyte replacement will also depend upon the availability of resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In resource-limited areas with little or no monitoring and laboratory capacity, qualitative assessments of urine frequency, volume, and color, as well as evaluation of skin turgor and mucous membranes, may assist in guiding volume replacement in the absence of more accurate measures.

Electrolyte replacement should be guided by plasma values since patients can present with a range of abnormalities. As an example, in a cohort study of patients admitted to a hospital in Sierra Leone, 32 of 97 presented with abnormal potassium levels, and the number who had hypokalemia and hyperkalemia were similar (19 versus 13, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Hypotension may sometimes persist despite adequate volume resuscitation, requiring the use of vasopressor infusions such as norepinephrine. Aggressive volume resuscitation may contribute to the development of pulmonary edema, and acute lung injury in the setting of shock may necessitate supplemental oxygen therapy (eg, nasal cannula or face mask).

When considering the management of such patients with Ebola virus disease, clinicians should recognize that some types of respiratory support present a hazard of generating infectious aerosols.

According to the WHO, individuals who no longer have signs and symptoms of Ebola virus disease can be discharged if they have two negative PCR tests on whole blood separated by at least 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

This approach is supported, in part, by a study that evaluated the presence of infectious virus over time in four patients with Ebola virus disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Twenty-eight plasma samples were tested by RT-PCR, and isolation of the virus was subsequently attempted. Ebola virus was not isolated from plasma samples if the cycle-threshold value was &gt;35.5 (higher cycle-threshold values indicate lower RNA levels) or if the sample was taken more than 12 days after the onset of symptoms. </p><p>Regardless of when an individual is discharged from the hospital, patients should receive information to help minimize the risk of transmission in the community (eg, counseling on safe sexual practices) since the virus can persist in a variety of body fluids (eg, urine, semen) for up to several months after the plasma tests negative for Ebola virus by RT-PCR.

However, as a result of the epidemic in West Africa, accelerated paths were developed for vaccine testing and introduction into field use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p>Prior to the epidemic in West Africa, a number of experimental vaccines had successfully protected nonhuman primates against an otherwise lethal Ebola virus challenge. These included a DNA vaccine followed by a recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector encoding the Ebola Zaire and Sudan surface glycoproteins (GP), the recombinant Ad5 vaccine alone, a virus-like particle vaccine, a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vector encoding Ebola surface GP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>], and a chimpanzee-adenovirus type 3 vaccine (ChAd3) encoding Ebola virus GP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. At the time the epidemic was recognized in 2014, the only vaccines that had been evaluated in humans were a multidose DNA vaccine and the recombinant Ad5 vaccine, which had both proven safe and immunogenic in Phase I trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/121-123\" class=\"abstract_t\">121-123</a>]. However, because recombinant Ad5 vaccines may be ineffective in persons with prior immunity to the adenovirus vector, the ChAd3 vaccine was believed to be more promising for human use.</p><p>A WHO expert panel that convened in September 2014 identified both the ChAd3 and VSV vaccines as the most advanced candidates for use in the West African outbreak, principally because both promised to be protective after a single inoculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Both vaccines were evaluated in healthy volunteers during the epidemic, as were an Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine and a recombinant vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine encoding the Ebola glycoprotein (MVA-BN-Filo), and they were all found to be immunogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/124-130\" class=\"abstract_t\">124-130</a>]. A six-month safety study found that the VSV vaccine was generally well tolerated, supporting its use for persons at risk of Ebola virus disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].</p><p>The VSV vaccine was the only specific countermeasure proven to have protective efficacy against Ebola virus during the West African epidemic. In a large trial of ring vaccination in Guinea, the VSV vaccine was safe and effective in inducing rapid immunity against Ebola virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. When a new case of Ebola virus disease was diagnosed, surveillance teams identified all close contacts of the patient and all contacts of those contacts. Each of these clusters was then randomized to receive the VSV vaccine either immediately or after 21 days; 3528 subjects were randomized and 3512 were vaccinated (2014 in the immediate arm and 1498 in the delayed arm). To exclude individuals who were already infected with Ebola virus at entry into the study, only patients who developed disease &ge;10 days after randomization were included in the analysis. Among immediately vaccinated individuals, no Ebola virus disease was seen after day 10, while there were 16 new cases among those assigned to delayed vaccination, indicating a clear benefit of immediate vaccination. In addition, no recipient developed Ebola virus disease more than six days after vaccination in either group. One febrile illness was the only serious side effect attributed to vaccination.</p><p>The recombinant VSV vaccine may also have a role in preventing disease and death when administered promptly after an exposure. This was demonstrated in two laboratory studies in macaques, the first employing challenge with the Zaire Ebola virus, and the second employing the West African Makona strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/133,134\" class=\"abstract_t\">133,134</a>].

During the 2014-2016 West African outbreak, the VSV vaccine was administered as post-exposure prophylaxis on a compassionate use basis to close contacts of a patient with Ebola virus disease, as well as to two health care workers who sustained a percutaneous injury with a needle that had come in contact with a contaminated glove; all recipients remained well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/135-137\" class=\"abstract_t\">135-137</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344738786\"><span class=\"h3\">Public health response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemic in West Africa demonstrated that an effective public health response requires effective communications between government authorities, medical professionals, and the local populace to explain the need for monitoring, sample collection and testing, and isolation and other infection control measures, and to explain the potential benefits of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/138-144\" class=\"abstract_t\">138-144</a>].

Patients may also require evaluation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment of concomitant infections. Several investigational antiviral therapies were used to treat patients during the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa, but their efficacy is unclear, and the availability of these drugs is limited. (See <a href=\"#H344737195\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3026817610\" class=\"local\">'Investigational therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ebola virus disease is associated with a high risk for fetal death and pregnancy-associated hemorrhage. There are no data to suggest whether cesarean or vaginal delivery is preferred or when the baby should be delivered. Thus, decisions regarding obstetrical care must be made on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H3386278978\" class=\"local\">'Considerations during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of care increase the likelihood that a patient with Ebola virus disease will survive. Patients who survive Ebola virus disease typically show signs of clinical improvement during the second week of illness. After discharge from the hospital, patients should be monitored for at least one year. (See <a href=\"#H132411\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H344739817\" class=\"local\">'Recovery and discharge from the hospital'</a> above and <a href=\"#H978107936\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To prevent transmission of Ebola virus, clinicians should follow infection prevention and control recommendations from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When caring for a patient with acute illness, precautions should include: isolation of hospitalized patients with known or suspected Ebola virus disease; hand hygiene; the use of standard, contact, and droplet precautions; and the correct use of appropriate personal protective equipment. (See <a href=\"#H1056044081\" class=\"local\">'Infection control precautions during acute illness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most survivors, only standard precautions are needed when clinical evaluation and care are performed. However, additional precautions are needed for those who present with late stage manifestations of Ebola disease, such as acute neurological or ocular symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3747126540\" class=\"local\">'Infection control precautions during convalescence'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional strategies to prevent the spread of Ebola virus disease include careful monitoring of individuals after a possible virus exposure, educating patients on how to reduce the risk of transmission through sexual contact or breastfeeding, and potentially vaccinating high-risk populations. (See <a href=\"#H2385748235\" class=\"local\">'Additional considerations'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Feldmann H, Geisbert TW.
