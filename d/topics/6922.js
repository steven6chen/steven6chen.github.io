The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of external otitis are discussed elsewhere.

Malignant external otitis, which refers to extension of infection to the skull base, is discussed elsewhere, as are acute otitis media and chronic suppurative otitis media with tympanic membrane perforation, which may result in ear canal inflammation.

The removal of cerumen, desquamated skin, and purulent material from the ear canal greatly facilitates healing and enhances penetration of ear drops into the site of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Ear canal cleaning should be performed through an otoscope that allows direct visualization and use of a wire loop or cotton swab to remove cerumen and debris. If the tympanic membrane is intact, the ear canal can be irrigated with a 1:1 dilution of 3% hydrogen peroxide with water at body temperature.</p><p>Patients with a ruptured tympanic membrane (or those in whom the tympanic membrane cannot be clearly seen) should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further management. Otolaryngologists often clean infected ears under a microscope, which provides binocular magnified vision and allows the use of both hands for cleaning. The ability to use both hands with magnified vision may also facilitate cleaning when the ear is extremely tender.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13312385\"><span class=\"h2\">Treating inflammation and infection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H505257461\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to treatment of inflammation and infection depends on the severity of external otitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F113296\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113296 \">algorithm 1</a>). Topical therapy is the mainstay of management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild disease is characterized by minor discomfort and pruritus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83227\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83227 \">picture 1</a>).

There are no randomized trials directly comparing topical and oral antibiotic therapies. However, the addition of an oral antibiotic to topical antibiotic therapy does not appear to enhance the response in uncomplicated external otitis. One randomized trial in Australia of patients with mostly mild to moderate infection found no difference in the clinical response score comparing a topical ointment (containing an antifungal, a glucocorticoid, and two antibiotics) plus oral placebo with the same topical ointment plus oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In comparison to topical therapy, systemic antibiotics may increase the likelihood of drug resistance and clinical recurrence, possibly related to lower antimicrobial concentrations at the site of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1194185155\"><span class=\"h4\">Mild disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For mild external otitis, we use a topical preparation combination such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetic acid</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> (an acidifying agent and a glucocorticoid) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67418 \">table 1</a>).

The antibiotic should have coverage against <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54268%7EPC%2F70073\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54268 graphicRef70073 \">table 2A-B</a>). Cipro HC (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>) and Cortisporin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a>, polymyxin, and hydrocortisone) are good first-line agents. We generally prefer Cipro HC; it is associated with fewer side effects than Cortisporin but more costly. Preparations containing aminoglycosides should be avoided in ears where the integrity of the tympanic membrane cannot be confirmed (See <a href=\"#H1295111\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3029125012\"><span class=\"h4\">Severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with severe disease, management includes topical therapy, wick placement, and, if there is evidence of deep tissue infection, oral antibiotics.</p><p>We use a topical preparation that is acidic and contains an antibiotic, an antiseptic, and a glucocorticoid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67418 \">table 1</a>).

We generally prefer Cipro HC; it is associated with fewer side effects than Cortisporin but more costly. Preparations containing aminoglycosides should be avoided in ears where the integrity of the tympanic membrane cannot be confirmed. (See <a href=\"#H1295111\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with severe disease should also have a wick placed if swelling may prevent adequate access of topical agents to the medial canal. Wicks are commercially available and made of polyvinyl alcohol sponge. They expand as the ototopical medicine is applied. Wicks allow topical medications to reach the medial aspect of the ear canal; they also facilitate longer retention of topical solution in the affected areas. Wicks should be replaced every one to three days if significant swelling persists. Wicks can be removed once ear canal swelling subsides. Wick placement usually requires referral to an otolaryngologist but can also be performed by a primary care practitioner with previous experience in the procedure.</p><p>For patients with deeper tissue infection (extension of infection beyond the external canal), systemic antibiotics, in addition to topical antibiotics, are indicated because of lack of adequate penetration with local therapy. When systemic antibiotics are necessary, we recommend a quinolone, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>, for coverage of <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>P. aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Ciprofloxacin can be given at a dose of 500 mg twice daily for adults and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/dose</span> twice daily for children (maximum 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dose)</span> for 7 to 10 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4222138789\"><span class=\"h4\">Immunocompromised hosts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the severity of infection, combined systemic and topical antibiotics are also indicated in patients who are immunosuppressed (eg, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, chemotherapy, chronic high-dose corticosteroid therapy, use of other immunosuppressive drugs, neutropenia, advanced human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection). The preferred topical and systemic antibiotics are the same as those used for severe disease. (See <a href=\"#H3029125012\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients who are immunosuppressed with deeper tissue infection may be at risk for malignant external otitis and should be referred to an otolaryngologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-necrotizing-external-otitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant (necrotizing) external otitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2137757361\"><span class=\"h3\">Installation of topical agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct application of topical agents to the infected site is a key element in the treatment of external otitis regardless of severity. Proper installation of ear drops entails tilting the head toward the opposite shoulder, pulling the superior aspect of the auricle upward, and filling the ear canal with drops. In young children, the earlobe should be pulled downward to fill the canal. Patients should lie on their side for three to five minutes or place a cotton ball in the ear canal for 20 minutes to maximize medicine exposure. A common cause of failure for topical treatment is underdosing. Patients should be sure that sufficient medication is placed to adequately coat the entirety of the ear canal.</p><p>Most topical preparations should be administered three to four times daily. Topical fluoroquinolones can be given two times daily.</p><p>It is reasonable to prescribe an initial seven-day course of topical medication with instructions to continue it up to a total of two weeks if symptoms have not resolved. Patients who have mild to moderate disease with symptoms persisting beyond one to two weeks should be reevaluated for treatment failure. (See <a href=\"#H1425377196\" class=\"local\">'Clinical follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H279397\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical therapy is very effective for managing external otitis, delivering a high concentration of medication to the infected and inflamed tissue with few side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>]. Several topical agents are available, including antibiotics, antiseptics, glucocorticoids, and acidifying solutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They come as single agents and in combination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67418 \">table 1</a>). Most preparations are in liquid form, although ointments and powders are also available. One meta-analysis of nineteen randomized trials found no clinically meaningful differences between various topical interventions, except that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetic acid</a> was less effective than <span class=\"nowrap\">antibiotic/glucocorticoid</span> drops for patients whose symptoms had not resolved by one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The overall quality of the studies was low.</p><p>Selection among the different types of topics preparations depends on severity of illness and is discussed elsewhere.

One systematic review found that topical antibiotics increased the cure rate compared with placebo by 46 percent (95% CI 29-63 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There was no difference in cure rates between topical antibiotics and antiseptics or combination <span class=\"nowrap\">antibiotic/glucocorticoid</span> preparations. There was also no difference between quinolone and nonquinolone antibiotics.</p><p>Certain factors should be considered when selecting an ototopical antibiotic: coverage of specific pathogens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54268%7EPC%2F70073\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54268 graphicRef70073 \">table 2A-B</a>), side effect profile (including ototoxicity and risk of contact dermatitis), drug resistance, and cost.</p><p>The ideal antibiotic regimen should have coverage against the most common pathogens, <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>P. aeruginosa</em>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fluoroquinolones <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> provide excellent coverage against both pathogens. In two clinical trials, ofloxacin appeared to be as effective as polymyxin B-neomycin-hydrocortisone (Cortisporin otic suspension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Side effect profile can also influence choice of treatment. Ototoxicity is the most important concern with aminoglycoside drugs, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Aminoglycosides are a significant potential source for iatrogenic hearing loss and balance dysfunction, particularly in the presence of tympanic membrane perforation. Allergic contact dermatitis is commonly associated with neomycin when used for prolonged courses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Topical fluoroquinolones can cause local irritation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Contact dermatitis'</a>.)</p><p>Concerns have been raised about the development of antibiotic resistance, particularly against <em>P. aeruginosa</em> with chronic use of ototopical fluoroquinolones. However, in vitro, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> sensitivity to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norfloxacin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norfloxacin</a> remained high (98 percent) in one study despite long-term antibiotic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The precise mechanism of action for antiseptics is not fully understood, but they make the ear canal less habitable for bacteria and may loosen debris in the ear canal. Acidifying solutions inhibit bacterial growth since <em>S. aureus</em> and <em>P. aeruginosa</em> do not grow as well in environments with a pH lower than 6 to 7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

This can be accomplished by placing a cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly in the ear canal while bathing. Patients with active external otitis should not swim.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Lesions that fail to heal despite antimicrobial treatment, those with unrelenting deep pain, and those with coexisting cranial nerve dysfunction or vertigo should raise suspicion for neoplasia of the auditory canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13312462\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventive interventions should be considered in patients with recurrent external otitis, immunocompromised hosts, and patients with a dermatologic condition affecting the ear. External otitis is a frequent occurrence in individuals who are habitually in the water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Specific measures for those who engage in water sports include use of ear plugs, shaking the ear dry after swimming, and blow drying the ear after water exposure (placing the blow dryer on a low setting 12 inches away from the ears) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Drops containing alcohol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetic acid</a> help to dry the ear, prevent skin maceration, and re-acidify the ear canal, but it is unclear if any type of intervention prevents recurrence of external otitis. Hearing aids should be removed nightly and regularly cleaned.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H569884709\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF OTHER CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of other conditions that present similarly to or complicate bacterial external otitis varies based on the underlying etiology. They should be suspected in patients who fail to respond to initial therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H569884918\"><span class=\"h2\">Otomycosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Otomycosis is a fungal infection of the external auditory canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83226\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83226 \">picture 4</a>). It can occur as the primary infection or can develop along with bacterial external otitis, usually as a result of antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Otomycosis'</a>.)</p><p>The mainstay of therapy for otomycosis is meticulous cleaning of the ear canal and topical antifungal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. All debris and visible fungal elements must be removed by the clinician. This should be done under direct vision with a cerumen loop or cotton swab. Binocular magnified vision facilitates removal of debris that is often present in the medial aspect of the ear canal, coating the tympanic membrane.</p><p>Several topical medications are used to treat otomycosis, including antifungals, antiseptics, acidifying solutions, glucocorticoids, and drying agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Topical antifungals are considered first-line pharmacologic treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75986\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75986 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clotrimazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clotrimazole</a> 1% solution, applied twice daily for 10 to 14 days. Clotrimazole has the greatest zone of inhibition for common fungi. Clotrimazole and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">miconazole</a> also have antibacterial effects against <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> but not <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. Some antifungals are available in liquid form, and others only as a cream or ointment that is either injected into or swabbed in the ear canal.</p><p>After 10 to 14 days of topical antifungal therapy, we reassess the ear canal. If fungal elements are identified, the ear canal should again be meticulously cleaned and undergo a further 10- to 14-day course of topical antifungal with reassessment thereafter. Persistent otomycosis should be managed by an otolaryngologist to ensure optimal cleaning of the external canal (usually with microscopic otoscopy). Ear cleaning followed by topical therapy and reassessment at two-week intervals may be required for several cycles to achieve eradication.</p><p>Oral antifungals may be used in refractory cases. Intravenous antifungals are reserved for patients suspected of having invasive otomycosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H569884925\"><span class=\"h2\">Contact dermatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact dermatitis in the external auditory canal can be caused by ototopical medication, cosmetics, or shampoos and thus can mimic or complicate treatment for external otitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Contact dermatitis'</a>.)</p><p>Initial treatment of contact dermatitis involves eliminating the causative agent. The ear should be thoroughly cleaned. Acidic solutions such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetic acid</a> otic help re-acidify the ear canal, dry weeping lesions, and debride crust. Topical glucocorticoids can be used in combination with acidic solutions to control the inflammatory response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67418 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63949169\"><span class=\"h2\">Periauricular cellulitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periauricular cellulitis without evidence of deep tissue infection is generally treated with oral antibiotics.

Patients with malignant external otitis should be promptly started on antipseudomonal antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> 750 mg orally twice daily for adults and 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/dose</span> twice daily for children [maximum 750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dose])</span> and referred urgently to an otolaryngologist. Rarely, invasive fungal external otitis can occur, and the clinician should keep this in mind if a patient fails to respond to antibacterial agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/external-otitis-treatment/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

The removal of cerumen, desquamated skin, and purulent material greatly facilitates healing and enhances penetration of ear drops into the site of inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H13312378\" class=\"local\">'Cleaning the ear canal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to treatment of inflammation and infection depends on the severity of external otitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F113296\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113296 \">algorithm 1</a>). Topical therapy is the mainstay of management. Many topical antibiotics, antiseptics, glucocorticoids, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acidifying solutions are available alone or in combination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67418 \">table 1</a>). The choice of topical therapy depends on the severity of external otitis (see <a href=\"#H505257461\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild disease is characterized by minor discomfort and pruritus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83227\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83227 \">picture 1</a>). There is minimal canal edema. For patients with mild disease, we suggest a non-antibiotic topical preparation containing an acidifying agent and a glucocorticoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetic acid</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>)</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1194185155\" class=\"local\">'Mild disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate disease is characterized by an intermediate degree of pain and pruritus. The canal may be partially occluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F83228\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83228 \">picture 2</a>). For patients with moderate disease, we suggest a topical preparation that is acidic and contains an antibiotic, an antiseptic, and a glucocorticoid (eg, Cipro HC, Cortisporin) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2791692134\" class=\"local\">'Moderate disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe disease is characterized by intense pain, and the canal is completely occluded from edema. There is usually fever, periauricular erythema, and regional lymphadenopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55712\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55712 \">picture 3</a>). For patients with severe disease, we suggest a topical preparation that is acidic and contains an antibiotic, an antiseptic, and a glucocorticoid (eg, Cipro HC, Cortisporin) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients with severe external otitis require placement of a wick, which allows topical medications to reach the medial aspect of the ear canal and also facilitates longer retention of topical solutions in the affected area. (See <a href=\"#H3029125012\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For patients with deeper tissue infection beyond the external auditory canal, we recommend systemic, in addition to topical, antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Antibiotic coverage should include the most common pathogens, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. Quinolones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofloxacin</a>) are effective first-line options that have few side effects. Patients with evidence of infection outside of the auditory canal may be at risk for malignant external otitis and should be referred urgently to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H63949176\" class=\"local\">'Malignant external otitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Combined systemic and topical antibiotics are also indicated in patients who are immunosuppressed. (See <a href=\"#H4222138789\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ear pain should also be managed with oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); those with intense pain associated with severe disease may require opioid analgesics. (See <a href=\"#H75561633\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ear should be protected from water during recovery from external otitis. This can be accomplished by placing a cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly in the ear canal while bathing. Specific preventive measures for those who engage in water sports include use of ear plugs, shaking the ear dry after swimming, and blow drying the ear after water exposure. (See <a href=\"#H13312462\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients will generally experience some symptom improvement within 36 to 48 hours after treatment is initiated, with full resolution by about six days. For moderate to severe disease, clinical follow-up should be scheduled in one to two weeks or sooner as necessary. In patients who do not respond to treatment, culture of the ear canal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referral to an otolaryngologist is warranted. Patients who do not respond to initial treatment should also be evaluated for other conditions that may mimic or complicate external otitis.
