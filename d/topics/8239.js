It does not usually cause symptoms. But it can be serious.</p><p>When your doctor or nurse tells you your blood pressure, he or she will say 2 numbers. For instance, your doctor or nurse might say that your blood pressure is &quot;140 over 90.&quot; The top number is the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is contracting. The bottom number is the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is relaxed.</p><p>The table shows how doctors and nurses define high and normal blood pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59480 \">table 1</a>). &quot;Elevated blood pressure&quot; is a term doctors or nurses use as a warning. People with elevated blood pressure do not yet have high blood pressure. But their blood pressure is not as low as it should be for good health.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24362996\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I lower my blood pressure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your doctor or nurse has prescribed blood pressure medicine, the most important thing you can do is to take it. If it causes side effects, do not just stop taking it. Instead, talk to your doctor or nurse about the problems it causes. He or she might be able to lower your dose or switch you to another medicine. If cost is a problem, mention that too. He or she might be able to put you on a less expensive medicine. Taking your blood pressure medicine can keep you from having a heart attack or stroke, and it can save your life!</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24363003\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You have a lot of control over your blood pressure. To lower it:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight (if you are overweight)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose a diet low in fat and rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the amount of salt you eat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do something active for at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cut down on alcohol (if you drink more than 2 alcoholic drinks per day)</p><p/><p>It's also a good idea to get a home blood pressure meter. People who check their own blood pressure at home do better at keeping it low and can sometimes even reduce the amount of medicine they take.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24363052\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-high-blood-pressure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for high blood pressure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=checking-your-blood-pressure-at-home-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Checking your blood pressure at home (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-artery-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Carotid artery disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-sodium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-sodium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-emergencies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure emergencies (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-diet-and-weight-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure, diet, and weight (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)</a> </p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
