The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 7.1 percent of abortions were performed between 14 to 20 weeks and 1.3 percent at or after 21 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Second-trimester abortion is associated with more morbidity and mortality and, for some women, more social or emotional challenges than first-trimester abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Legal induced abortion is rarely associated with death; from 2008 to 2012, the CDC reported 36 deaths associated with abortions in the United States, the case-fatality-ratio was 0.80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The mortality risk increases by 38 percent for each successive gestational week after eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Similar to first-trimester abortion, second-trimester procedures can be performed either with dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) or medication. An overview of second-trimester pregnancy termination and the procedure for surgical termination are reviewed here. Second-trimester induction termination and second-trimester D&amp;E, as well as first-trimester pregnancy termination and other topics regarding induced abortion, are discussed separately.

Procedures are often performed in the second trimester because of a delay in diagnosis of the pregnancy or delay in obtaining an abortion. As an example, at one large United States public hospital, 58 percent of patients having second-trimester procedures were already beyond the first trimester by the time they obtained a pregnancy<strong> </strong>test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>For some women, a fetal anomaly or maternal illness (eg, early onset severe preeclampsia) is not recognized or does not present until the second-trimester. Midtrimester preterm premature rupture of membranes may also be an indication for pregnancy termination.</p><p>There are no contraindications to second-trimester abortion, although some women with medical comorbidities have an increased risk of complications. However, ongoing pregnancy and delivery are also usually associated with a risk of complications in these patients. Women with significant medical conditions should be managed by an experienced surgeon and may require consultation with an appropriate specialist (eg, cardiologist, pulmonologist).</p><p>Laws regarding abortion vary by country and by state in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Most states restrict abortion after fetal viability, though the definition of viability varies by state and maternal-fetal exemptions that countermand the viability statute vary by state. Clinicians offering abortion need to become familiar with local restrictions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H652738\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining gestational age is a critical part of providing appropriate care.

Surgical and induction options for the procedure should be reviewed. Women should be counseled about follow-up care and potential complications of the procedure. This discussion should be documented on the procedure consent form and in the medical record. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination#H1837728144\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Counseling regarding pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Overview'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination#H2631578888\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Counseling regarding pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Preprocedure counseling'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination#H432171598\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Counseling regarding pregnancy termination&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12652720\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING DILATION AND EVACUATION VERSUS INDUCTION TERMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second-trimester pregnancy termination can be performed by dilating the cervix and evacuating products of conception (dilation and evacuation; D&amp;E) or by using medication to induce delivery of the fetus and placenta. D&amp;E accounts for the great majority of second-trimester abortions in the United States (US) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, in 2010, uterine curettage was used in 96 to 98 percent of abortions at 9 to 17 weeks of gestation, 94.1 percent at 18 to 20 weeks, and 91 percent at &ge;21 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].</p><p>Historically, in the 1970s to 1980s, D&amp;E was preferred because it was found to result in fewer complications than the method used for induction termination at the time, hyperosmolar instillation or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. Most of the morbidity originally associated with second-trimester induction termination derived from prolonged induction times. The introduction of induction regimens with prostaglandins and progesterone antagonists has narrowed the safety gap between surgical and medical methods by shortening the interval from induction to complete abortion.</p><p>Induction termination and D&amp;E are both safe procedures throughout the second trimester; types of morbidity vary. For example, patients undergoing D&amp;E risk uterine perforation with need for surgical repair, whereas patients undergoing medical abortion confront higher rates of hemorrhage and infection. Patients with different medical histories might have reason to fear one type of complication more than another, influencing their selection of procedure.</p><p>Given the available data and other considerations, the choice depends mainly upon patient preference and the availability of a clinician with the skills and experience to provide one or both approaches. The clinician and patient should engage in shared decision-making to consider all the factors. For women planning second-trimester pregnancy termination, we suggest D&amp;E for those who prefer a procedure with greater control over timing and less experience of the procedure. We suggest induction (medication) abortion for women who place a high value on avoiding surgery or have a reason to prefer an intact fetus and who are willing to accept more discomfort and awareness during the procedure, a larger blood loss, and a chance of additional surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78402977\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both D&amp;E and induction abortion in the second trimester are safe and effective, but D&amp;E is preferred by most women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In addition, approximately 8 percent of women who undergo induction abortion require a surgical procedure for retained placenta. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-induction-medication-termination#H8857880\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-trimester pregnancy termination: Induction (medication) termination&quot;, section on 'Retained placenta'</a>.)</p><p>There are few well-designed studies comparing the two approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Randomized trials are difficult to conduct because women often decline to be randomly assigned due to a strong preference for D&amp;E (eg, in one trial, 38 percent of the women recruited declined randomization and 67 percent of these wanted D&amp;E [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]).</p><p>The only completed randomized trial found that complication rates were comparable, but induction abortion was associated with more adverse effects and a risk of subsequent D&amp;E for retained products of conception. This trial (n = 122) compared D&amp;E and induction abortion (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>) at 13 to 20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In terms of efficacy, 10 percent of women in the induction group underwent a subsequent procedure for retained products of conception. The rate of complications was comparable for surgical and induction procedures (12.0 versus 11.5 percent), but the type of complication varied by the type of abortion: Blood loss &gt;500 mL was more likely in the surgical group and retained placenta in the induction group. As noted, induction abortion was more likely to result in a subsequent procedure (10 percent compared with 2 percent in the surgical group). Women in the surgical group experienced significantly lower rates of some adverse effects: unexpected overnight stay (0 versus 31 percent) and uterine bleeding heavier than menses (4 versus 37 percent); moderate to severe pain was also less common in the surgical group, but this did not reach statistical significance (23 versus 43 percent). Women in the surgical group found the procedure more acceptable (100 versus 53 percent would choose the same procedure in the future). This trial was limited by a lack of statistical power and a low follow-up rate (60 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78402983\"><span class=\"h2\">Advantages and disadvantages</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78403022\"><span class=\"h3\">Dilation and evacuation</span></p><p>Advantages of D&amp;E include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased procedure duration and predictable timing</strong> &ndash; Although patients usually undergo one to two days of cervical preparation, experienced surgeons can perform uterine evacuation in less than 30 minutes once the cervix is dilated. Induction abortion, by contrast, may take as long as 24 hours or longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased cost</strong> &ndash; D&amp;E usually occurs in an outpatient facility. Induction abortion often requires admission to a higher-cost labor and delivery unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medical conditions that required controlled timing of the procedure</strong> &ndash; The controlled timing of D&amp;E permits planned procedures for patients whose medical conditions may worsen peripartum. Patients with bleeding diatheses, cardiac, and other maternal conditions often benefit from scheduled surgical procedures rather than less-predictable induction procedures. Patients with multiple prior uterine surgeries and placenta previa can also undergo safe D&amp;E, reducing risks of uterine rupture or hemorrhage.</p><p/><p>Disadvantages of D&amp;E include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk of uterine perforation</strong> &ndash; Uterine perforation is a potential risk of D&amp;E and requires further surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation#H441158409\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-trimester pregnancy termination: Dilation and evacuation&quot;, section on 'Uterine perforation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78403003\"><span class=\"h3\">Induction abortion</span></p><p>Advantages of induction include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Desire for an intact fetus</strong> &ndash; Some patients choose labor induction to avoid fetal destruction associated with D&amp;E. This may be due to a desire to hold the fetus or to provide an intact fetus for morphologic evaluation (this may be important when congenital anomalies are present). However, this may also be possible with intact D&amp;E. </p><p/><p>Disadvantages of induction include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased experience of the procedure</strong> &ndash; In induction abortion, the patient experiences uncomfortable effects (bleeding, cramping, nausea, vomiting) and these occur over a longer period of time during and after the procedure than with D&amp;E [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The patient also has a greater awareness of the process of terminating the pregnancy. Many patients find that the predictability of D&amp;E and avoiding the memory of prolonged labor make D&amp;E less emotionally burdensome than induction abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unpredictability of the timing of delivery</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk of hemorrhage and infection</strong> &ndash; Second-trimester induction termination is generally associated with a higher volume of blood loss than D&amp;E in most studies, although the opposite was found in the trial described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/18,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23-25</a>]. Induction abortion is also typically associated with a higher risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-trimester-pregnancy-termination-dilation-and-evacuation#H441158617\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-trimester pregnancy termination: Dilation and evacuation&quot;, section on 'Hemorrhage'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H652664\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second-trimester D&amp;E is typically performed in an outpatient setting, either a specialty women's health clinic, a clinician's office equipped with a procedure room, or an ambulatory surgery center.</p><p>Second-trimester induction most commonly occurs in hospitals on a labor and delivery unit or a family planning unit within the hospital. Induction procedures can be performed in outpatient settings, with the appropriate medical staff and equipment to provide ongoing administration of induction agents, analgesia and anesthesia, monitoring of patient status, delivery of the fetus and placenta (timing is often unpredictable), and, if needed, emergency surgical management (in case of a need for immediate evacuation of either fetus or placenta) or emergency transport to an inpatient facility.</p><p>Clinics or hospitals that provide pregnancy termination must have the appropriate medical staff, equipment, and medication to perform the procedure and manage complications and to provide analgesia and anesthesia. The National Abortion Federation, a professional organization of abortion providers in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Colombia, has issued <a href=\"http://prochoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2014NAFCPGs.pdf&amp;token=xpScufR+LN173/wSYmqLfYG2UiJaSvDiZBmmnHXymjS4xrd6p7dqdJPs2Q7plNDalSpsWzViCcsgolA31fYNFA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14194\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">clinical policy guidelines</a> regarding medical personnel and facilities that provide pregnancy termination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These stipulate that abortions should be provided by a licensed practitioner. The minimum requirements for a facility include presence on-site of a medical staff member with updated basic life support certification; an oxygen delivery system, oral airways, self-inflating respirator bags, and bronchodilators; and uterotonics and vasopressors, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>. In settings in which opioids or benzodiazepines are used, appropriate antagonists must be available.</p><p>It is useful for outpatient clinics to have written protocols to address emergencies, particularly indications for emergency transport to a hospital and contact information for personnel who are able to be immediately available to facilitate transport.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78403351\"><span class=\"h1\">ABORTION TECHNIQUES AND PROTOCOLS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9928507\"><span class=\"h2\">Dilation and evacuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second-trimester dilation and evacuation is discussed separately.

This may occur spontaneously and, in some cases, midtrimester rupture of membranes is the indication for pregnancy termination. Alternatively, it may develop after insertion of osmotic dilators or during a prolonged induction procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prelabor-rupture-of-membranes-before-and-at-the-limit-of-viability#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prelabor rupture of membranes before and at the limit of viability&quot;, section on 'Chorioamnionitis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with chorioamnionitis present with fever and other possible findings (pelvic and abdominal pain, uterine contractions, purulent cervical discharge). Uterine evacuation is the cornerstone of treating second-trimester chorioamnionitis. No studies have evaluated the relative benefits of surgical versus medical abortion in this setting.</p><p>For patients who are hemodynamically stable and have early chorioamnionitis, surgical or induction abortion may proceed in the same manner as for other patients. In our practice, if a patient develops a persistent temperature elevation &gt;100.4&deg;F, we treat with antibiotics, in the same manner as chorioamnionitis during obstetric induction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intra-amniotic-infection-clinical-chorioamnionitis-or-triple-i#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intra-amniotic infection (clinical chorioamnionitis or triple I)&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Given high mortality rates associated with septic abortion, evacuation should be expedited for patients who are overtly septic. The best option for the patient must be individualized, and the surgeon should choose the one that best expedites uterine evacuation. Approaches include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place osmotic dilators to prepare for D&amp;E. There is no evidence that use of osmotic dilators exacerbates infection in patients with chorioamnionitis.

(See <a href=\"#H9928484\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for second-trimester abortion include socioeconomic and psychosocial factors (often in cases of a delay in diagnosis of the pregnancy or delay in obtaining an abortion), fetal anomaly, preterm premature rupture of membranes, or maternal illness. There are no contraindications to second-trimester abortion, although some women with medical comorbidities have an increased risk of complications. (See <a href=\"#H449012\" class=\"local\">'Indications and contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second-trimester pregnancy termination can be performed as a surgical evacuation of the uterus (dilation and evacuation; D&amp;E) or by using medication to induce delivery of the fetus and placenta. (See <a href=\"#H12652720\" class=\"local\">'Choosing dilation and evacuation versus induction termination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both D&amp;E and induction methods are safe and effective options for second-trimester pregnancy termination. The choice depends mainly upon patient preference and the availability of a clinician with the skills and experience to provide one or both approaches. For women planning second-trimester pregnancy termination (see <a href=\"#H12652720\" class=\"local\">'Choosing dilation and evacuation versus induction termination'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest D&amp;E for those who prefer a procedure with greater control over timing and less experience of the procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest induction (medication) abortion for women who place a high value on avoiding surgery or have a reason to prefer an intact fetus and who are willing to accept more discomfort and awareness during the procedure, a larger blood loss, and a chance of additional surgical intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be given detailed instructions regarding signs and symptoms of complications, including fever, excessive vaginal bleeding, or severe or persistent pelvic or abdominal pain. Many clinicians schedule a follow-up visit at two weeks after second-trimester pregnancy termination. Options for contraceptives are typically part of counseling before and after the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H12652881\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional expertise or consultation may be required depending upon the clinical context (eg, elective abortion, preterm premature rupture of membranes) and special circumstances (eg, comorbidities, uterine anomaly, low-lying placenta).
