SpA can also be differentiated into axial and peripheral SpA, depending upon the predominant regions of involvement. Axial SpA includes both AS and nr-axSpA, based upon the presence or absence, respectively, of abnormalities of the sacroiliac joints on plain radiography.</p><p>This topic review will focus primarily on the pathogenesis of AS, regarding which the most is known. The pathogenesis of each of the other members of the SpA family, especially nr-axSpA, is probably closely related to that of AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

These elements include interactions in the context of a particular genetic background between the gut microbiome, innate lymphoid cells, and the anatomic structures that are disease targets. Those structures include, for axial SpA, the entheses along the axial skeleton, and for peripheral SpA, the peripheral joints. At the sites of pathology, the major mediators are tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-17A. (See <a href=\"#H620882388\" class=\"local\">'Proinflammatory mediators validated by clinical observations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1468315086\" class=\"local\">'The gut microbiome, gut mucosa, and IL-23'</a> below.)</p><p>The largest single genetic contribution is from the gene for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, but the presence of HLA-B27 is not absolutely essential. Moreover, non-HLA genes and others are also involved. (See <a href=\"#H204843856\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> below.)</p><p>A major challenge for investigators is that at the entheses, where ligaments are attached to the cartilage in the vertebrae, two different processes both occur that may seem paradoxical. One is inflammation, sometimes with destruction of bone (an osteoclastic process), while the other process is new bone formation leading to syndesmophytes (an osteoblastic process). At its worst, the new bone formation can convert the entire vertebral column into a rigid bamboo spine, the hallmark of severe ankylosing spondylitis (AS). A comprehensive hypothesis of SpA pathogenesis needs to address both the inflammatory osteoclastic and the osteoblastic processes. (See <a href=\"#H114573112\" class=\"local\">'Coexisting bone erosion and new bone formation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620882388\"><span class=\"h1\">PROINFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS VALIDATED BY CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyclooxygenase (COX), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-17 are mediators that have all been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis (SpA), based in part upon the efficacy of targeted therapies directed at these mediators in clinical trials []:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cyclooxygenase</strong> &ndash; Inhibition of COX by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is very effective in controlling disease activity in some patients with SpA. This is probably because the COX enzymes are required for the generation of the proinflammatory compounds, the prostaglandins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-pharmacology-and-mechanism-of-action#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Pharmacology and mechanism of action&quot;, section on 'Mechanism of action'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TNF-alpha and IL-17</strong> &ndash; TNF itself is a pleiotropic cytokine and a strong inducer of a host of inflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. IL-17 is produced by a large variety of cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]; like TNF-alpha, it is also an orchestrator for a family of mediators. However, IL-17 by itself is not a potent inflammatory inducer. IL-17 induces the expression of and synergizes with a host of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-alpha, and acts in a positive feedback loop to enhance the production and effects of IL-17. As a result of these interactions, IL-17 has a clinical effect that is as potent as that of TNF-alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H503018377\" class=\"local\">'Overview of pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>IL-17 interactions with IL-23 and IL-22</strong> &ndash; In SpA, IL-17 should be considered a part of an axis of cytokines together with IL-23 and IL-22. IL-23 is responsible for inducing the differentiation of and stabilizing the IL-17 cells through the IL-23 receptor and IL-22 for inducing osteogenesis after the inflammation has faded. All three components are considered essential to SpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Given that an ultimate goal of studying pathogenesis is to provide better therapy, the observations from clinical trials that these three classes of target-specific therapeutic agents are effective in at least some patients with SpA have been important contributions to the identification of critical elements in disease pathogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1468315086\"><span class=\"h1\">THE GUT MICROBIOME, GUT MUCOSA, AND IL-23</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1919747952\"><span class=\"h2\">Presence of mucosal lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gut microbiome has been incriminated as having a role in the pathogenesis of several types of inflammatory arthritis, including spondyloarthritis (SpA), in which defects in the gut mucosal barriers have been implicated in this process. Normally, the microbiome is separated from the host by a gut epithelial barrier and a gut vascular barrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, when the integrity of the barriers is compromised, the microbes become capable of initiating a systemic immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Lesions in the gut mucosa in patients with SpA were first demonstrated in the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Additional evidence supporting a role for these issues in pathogenesis includes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The demonstration by ileocolonoscopy of the presence of subclinical acute or chronic intestinal inflammation in about two-thirds of patients with SpA, with functional breaches in the gut epithelium in SpA</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The correlation between chronic gut inflammation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-demonstrable SpA disease activity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sharing of genes between ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Crohn disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of AS in 4 to 10 percent of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Findings of sacroiliitis on plain radiographs in a significant proportion of patients with Crohn disease, many of whom do not have symptoms of inflammatory back pain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2699185479\"><span class=\"h2\">SpA-specific gut microbiome and damage of intestinal mucosal barriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The composition of the gut microbiome, which is influenced by genetic and other factors, differs in patients with SpA from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and from healthy individuals. Evidence in both humans and more so in animal models supports the view that the gut microbiome plays a vanguard role in the cascade of events leading to inflammation in many patients with SpA.</p><p>The strongest evidence that the gut microbiome is necessary for development of SpA comes from animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In these models, rats and mice develop SpA-like clinical and pathologic features when housed in their usual laboratory environment; however, they fail to develop such features when raised in a germ-free environment, although the SpA-like features do appear when the animals are brought out of the germ-free environment.</p><p>Data in humans also argue for a role of the gut microbiome in disease pathogenesis. The enormous diversity in the trillions of commensal microbial cells in the human gut is affected by multiple factors, including geography, ethnicity, age, gender, and diet. A description, or &quot;census,&quot; of the microbiota in each individual can allow for the characterization of that individual's microbiome by sequencing and analytic techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Using this approach, a core microbiome set can be demonstrated, which is unique for each person at a given point in time and has the capacity to distinguish between different individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Studies of gut microbiome patterns using ileal and colonic microbial samples from a small number of individuals have shown distinctions between patients with SpA and controls, as might be expected if the gut microbiome is responsible for SpA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>The largest study of gut microbiota in AS required the analysis of stool samples. The study, which involved 96 patients with SpA, 32 patients with RA, and 71 healthy controls, found that the microbiota composition of SpA and RA patients was different from the healthy controls and that the microbiota composition of the SpA patients also differed from the RA patients. Among the healthy controls, those who were human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 positive had different patterns from those who were HLA-B27 negative. Notably, there was an increase in the <em>Ruminococcus gnavus</em> species in patients with AS who had active disease. <em>R. gnavus</em> is an anaerobic Gram-positive cocci and is a frequent commensal of the gut that has also been associated with Crohn disease. Because it is a mucolytic bacteria, it might have the capacity to generate breakdown in the epithelial integrity of the gut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Breakdown of the gut epithelial and gut vascular barriers has been shown in a study of HLA-B27-positive patients with AS using ileal biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Breakdowns were demonstrated by immunohistology, findings of the downregulation of junctional proteins, and evidence of increased serum levels of bacterial lipopolysaccharides.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4144062571\"><span class=\"h2\">IL-23 induction by the gut microbiota</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The loss of architectural and functional integrity in the intestinal epithelium allows for passage of microbiota or their metabolites into the systemic circulation (see <a href=\"#H2699185479\" class=\"local\">'SpA-specific gut microbiome and damage of intestinal mucosal barriers'</a> above). The first line of defense is macrophages. While the macrophages in the gut of individuals with SpA are polarized to accommodate the microbes, the IL-23 that is present activates two types of cells which can mediate disease, T-helper 17 (Th17) cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs).</p><p>Th17 cells, a subset of activated CD4-positive cells, promote inflammation by the production of IL-17, TNF-alpha, and other cytokines. By contrast, ILCs are a type of lymphoid cell generated by a process independent of the thymus. ILCs do not undergo rearrangement of their T-cell receptors, and they respond to antigens independently of the major histocompatibility system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The particular ILCs that seem to be involved in SpA are those with receptors for IL-23 (IL-23R) and that can release IL-17 and IL-22. This type of ILC has been designated as a subset termed ILC3 cells. ILC3 cells have the potential to be the mediator of enthesitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1528141582\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential roles of group 3 innate lymphoid cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ILC3 subset of innate lymphoid cells are thought to serve as a link between the bowel and musculoskeletal tissue sites. The AS gut ILC3 express the <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha-4/beta-7</span> integrin, which can function as a homing receptor. The ligand for this integrin is mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MADCAM1), which, in patients with AS, is strongly expressed in the high endothelial venules (HEV) of the gut and bone marrow.</p><p>The gut-derived ILC3 in patients with AS are postulated to migrate into the systemic circulation and to home via this integrin-ligand interaction towards the bone marrow, the peripheral joints, and the entheses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In both the bone marrow and the synovia, the macrophages are polarized towards the subtype which generates IL-23 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F116007\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116007 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3026427007\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible role for IL-23</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several lines of evidence have converged to support a possible role of IL-23 in the pathogenesis of AS, with the gut as a potential site where the process begins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

The mode of inheritance is polygenic with multiplicative interaction among loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 gene was recognized in 1973 and has the strongest association with the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F85593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85593 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

At least 100 subtypes of HLA-B27 have been characterized; differences between these subtypes affect whether they are associated with spondyloarthritis (SpA), including AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/30,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32-34</a>].

The misfolding hypothesis explaining the HLA-B27 association with SpA is based upon a feature of molecular biogenesis peculiar to HLA-B27, by which HLA-B27 could begin to induce SpA before it reaches the surface of the cell due to protein misfolding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. The HLA-B27 misfolding hypothesis can be summarized as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68574\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68574 \">figure 5</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mature HLA-B27 has a quaternary structure with three different components.

Alternately, misfolding can lead to another process termed the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (ERUPR), which can also activate the <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-23/IL-17</span> pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55882\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55882 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, there is no convincing evidence that HLA-B27-activated ERUPR exists in AS patients. The likelihood is that misfolding of HLA-B27 leads only to autophagy, and it is this autophagy which activates the <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-23/IL-17</span> pathway. The cells that undergo autophagy are the Paneth cells in the intestinal epithelial lining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/24,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3002073334\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-HLA genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The search for non-HLA-B27 genes that may be important in SpA pathogenesis has focused almost exclusively on patients with AS and has suggested that non-major histocompatability complex (MHC) genes are also important in disease susceptibility. Since 2010, several large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been carried out in several populations of European [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>] and Han Chinese descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. These studies have identified a total of at least 113 genetic variants. Approximately 20 percent of the heritable risk is from MHC variants, of which HLA-B27 is the major contributor. Approximately 7 percent of the heritable risk is from non-MHC variants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F85593\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85593 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/31,56-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,56-61</a>]. The apparent need for an HLA-B27-positive individual to also carry some of these non-MHC genes in order to develop AS may explain, at least in part, why only 1 to 5 percent of HLA-B27-positive individuals develop AS.</p><p>Even though the total contribution of all these non-MHC genes to AS heritability is relatively small, these associations provide clues about the pathogenesis of AS. In addition, their significance can be amplified by gene-gene interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. These non-MHC AS-causing genes can be grouped into several functional categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">IL-23/IL-17</span> pathway</strong> &ndash; One group of genes associated with AS provides evidence of a role of the <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-23/IL-17</span> pathway in the disease (see <a href=\"#H620882388\" class=\"local\">'Proinflammatory mediators validated by clinical observations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4144062571\" class=\"local\">'IL-23 induction by the gut microbiota'</a> above). GWAS have identified associations with genes for the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R), as well as tyrosine kinase 2 (<em>TYK2</em>) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (<em>STAT3</em>), which are involved in the IL-23R signaling pathway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ERAP1 and ERAP2</strong> &ndash; The two endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases that encode genes related to AS are termed ERAP1 and ERAP2; each of the genes has variants that may increase the risk of AS and variants that are protective. These two enzymes are responsible for the generation as well as trimming and destruction of peptides in the endoplasmic reticulum to achieve the correct length for loading into HLA class I molecules, such as HLA-B27, for antigen presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

These findings may appear paradoxical and are poorly understood. This is in contrast to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), where only bone erosion is observed.</p><p>One clue is provided by longitudinal studies of the spine in the same patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and radiography. Using two different sequences, MRI can visualize both inflammation and repair processes, identified respectively as bone marrow edema and fat metaplasia. New bone formation (for example, syndesmophytes) is best visualized by plain radiography. These studies suggest that the initial change is inflammation. This is then followed to a certain extent by a reparative process at the vertebral corners and other sites of the axial skeleton, and finally by new bone formation (such as syndesmophytes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F116045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116045 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Cross-sectional studies of the histology indicate that only the fat metaplasia which shows fibrous-like granulation tissue will lead to new bone formation, and that new bone formation appears after the inflammation has subsided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Osteoblast differentiation involves use of the bone morphogenic proteins and the Wnt pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Several biomarkers have been identified that seem to mediate or inhibit the process of new bone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>New bone formation does not occur in the vertebral body, where the inflammation has destroyed the microarchitecture; rather, syndesmophyte are formed at the periosteum-cartilage junction. There, mesenchymal stem cells are driven into osteogenesis by interleukin (IL)-22 from the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R)-positive type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The ILC3 observed at the entheseal soft tissues are similar in phenotype to those observed in the synovial fluid of SpA patients.

Other non-gut-related mechanisms may play a role.

At the waning of the inflammation, IL-22 activates an osteogenic process leading to syndesmophyte formation.
