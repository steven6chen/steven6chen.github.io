For this reason, IgE-mediated immunologic pathways have long represented an attractive target for therapeutic agents in asthma and other allergic diseases.</p><p>This review will examine IgE neutralization therapy with anti-IgE monoclonal antibody, with a focus on the treatment of asthma. Other promising approaches to reducing IgE, as well as investigational applications of anti-IgE to other disorders, will be discussed briefly. The role of anti-IgE therapy in the overall management of asthma, as recommended by national and international asthma guidelines, is presented separately. The use of anti-IgE in the management of chronic urticaria is also discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-treatment-of-refractory-symptoms#H22592681\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Treatment of refractory symptoms&quot;, section on 'Omalizumab'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF IgE IN ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most asthmatic patients have elevated circulating immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentrations when levels are adjusted for age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Allergic sensitization results from the formation of specific IgE in response to common inhalant allergens, such as those derived from house dust mites, pollens, animal dander, molds, and cockroaches.</p><p>IgE is produced by B lymphocytes under the direction of two cytokines: interleukin-4 (IL-4) and the closely related interleukin-13 (IL-13), which are produced by several cell types including T helper type 2 (Th2) cells (a subset of T helper lymphocytes prevalent in atopy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. IgE formation is markedly enhanced by the interaction of two costimulatory molecules: CD40 ligand expressed on Th2 cells and CD40 expressed on B cells. Appropriately stimulated B cells mature into plasma cells that secrete allergen-specific IgE, which circulates and binds to high-affinity receptors (Fc-epsilon-RI) on the surface of mast cells, basophils, and other cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Surface receptors and signal transduction&quot;, section on 'High affinity IgE receptor'</a>.)</p><p>Bridging of IgE molecules on mast cells and basophils by protein allergens results in the activation of these cells. Activation leads to release of preformed mediators, such as histamine, and increased synthesis of lipid mediators, such as prostaglandins and cysteinyl-leukotrienes, which in turn results in bronchoconstriction and plasma exudation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Subsequently, mast cells and basophils synthesize and release a number of cytokines important in allergic inflammation. Thus, IgE plays a central role in the mechanism of immediate bronchoconstriction and the late inflammatory response after allergen inhalation challenge of allergic asthmatic subjects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-biology-of-ige\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The biology of IgE&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-relationship-between-ige-and-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The relationship between IgE and allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Circulating IgE also binds to high-affinity receptors on dendritic cells and to low-affinity IgE receptors (Fc-epsilon-RII or CD23) found on B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Allergen may also interact with bound IgE on these cells, although higher concentrations of allergenic proteins may be required to result in cell activation.</p><p>Atopy is the strongest risk factor for developing asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8</a>]. Up to 80 percent of asthmatic patients in the United States and other developed countries are atopic, with one or more positive skin tests to common allergens and detectable allergen-specific IgE concentrations in serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Exposure to allergens to which patients are sensitive can lead to acute and chronic asthma symptoms. A small proportion of asthmatic patients have &quot;intrinsic&quot; asthma with negative skin tests, normal levels of total IgE, and no circulating specific IgE. Others lose their atopic status over time, but not their asthma. However, some of these patients may have local mucosal formation of IgE or may have IgE directed against currently unrecognized environmental allergens, suggesting that IgE may be abnormal in nearly all asthmatic patients, irrespective of whether they are atopic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Subcutaneous immunotherapy is associated with significant risk of systemic reactions in those with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma. However, immunotherapy should be considered in some atopic patients with clear allergic triggers. Successful immunotherapy is associated with a suppression of the usual postseasonal rise in allergen-specific IgE. In some countries, sublingual immunotherapy is preferred for patients with asthma, as the risk of anaphylaxis is less than for injection immunotherapy.

This randomized trial included 328 patients with normal lung function aged 12 to 75 years with incompletely controlled atopic asthma despite inhaled glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. An analysis of responses in patients with high <span class=\"nowrap\">(&ge;300/microL)</span> versus low <span class=\"nowrap\">(&le;300/microL)</span> absolute peripheral eosinophil counts was planned at the study outset. The primary endpoint of the study was a reduction in the rate of asthma exacerbations during the six-month treatment period. Although the exacerbation rate was reduced in the omalizumab group compared with placebo, the difference was not statistically significant in the group as a whole, and thus the primary endpoint was not met. However, in the high eosinophil group, the exacerbation rate was reduced by 45 percent (0.4 to 0.22 <span class=\"nowrap\">exacerbations/patient</span> during the treatment period [95% CI 0.25-1.22]), while there was no change in the low eosinophil group. Preliminary analysis of previously conducted clinical trials suggests that responses to omalizumab are indeed better in patients with higher eosinophil counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In a previous randomized trial of 1070 patients with allergic asthma performed to assess clinical predictors of responsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>, only impaired baseline lung function or frequent exacerbations despite high-dose inhaled glucocorticoid therapy was correlated to a good response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This study did not evaluate peripheral eosinophil count as a predictor of omalizumab responsiveness.</p><p>The importance of allergic triggers in a patient's disease may also be a factor, although the best means of assessing this beyond clinical history has not been determined:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial of 419 inner-city children, adolescents, and young adults (6 to 20 years of age) found the greatest benefit in patients with allergy to prevalent indoor allergens (cockroach and dust mite) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Unexpectedly, this study also found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> reduced seasonal exacerbations in the fall and spring, without altering rates of positive cultures for common respiratory viruses. These findings indicate that, as would be expected, omalizumab does not prevent viral infection, although it may have some indirect effect on the patient's tendency to develop an asthma exacerbation as a result of that infection. Alternatively, it may provide some protective benefit based on its effects on seasonal allergic triggers. These issues require further study.

In a proof-of-concept pilot study of 41 patients with refractory nonallergic asthma, there was a reduction in expression in Fc-epsilon-RI on basophils and a significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) after 16 weeks of therapy, as well as a trend towards reduction in exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Patients were characterized as nonatopic based upon negative allergen skin prick testing and negative allergen-specific IgE immunoassays for a battery of common inhalant allergens. Mean serum total IgE was 150 to 160 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> in both the placebo and active treatment groups. These findings suggest that omalizumab may also have efficacy in nonatopic asthma, although larger trials are needed before it can be recommended in this group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4239623\"><span class=\"h3\">Virus-induced asthma exacerbations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small number of studies have found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> decreases the rate of asthma exacerbations associated with viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29</a>].

In inner-city asthmatic children, the addition of omalizumab prior to the start of school in the fall was more effective in preventing exacerbations than doubling inhaled glucocorticoids in those children with a recent exacerbation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Omalizumab</a> binds to the third constant domain of the IgE heavy chain (C-epsilon-3), which is the same site at which IgE normally binds to both high- and low-affinity IgE receptors on mast cells, basophils, and other cell types. Thus, omalizumab forms complexes with free IgE and prevents its interaction with these receptors. The omalizumab-IgE complexes are subsequently cleared by the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59320\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59320 \">figure 2</a>). The antibody is specific to IgE and does not bind to immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin A (IgA). An important property of omalizumab is that it cannot bind to IgE receptors or to IgE already attached to the alpha chain of Fc-epsilon-RI, and therefore does not interact with cell-bound IgE or activate mast cells or basophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Hypersensitivity reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>Free IgE must be reduced to extremely low levels to achieve clinical efficacy. This is because there are 10,000 to 1,000,000 Fc-epsilon-RIs on mast cells and basophils, and nearly all are occupied by IgE. Only 2000 IgE molecules are needed for half-maximal release of histamine from basophils. Therefore, a marked reduction in IgE is needed to prevent mast cell and basophil activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Omalizumab</a> therapy causes a marked downregulation of Fc-epsilon-RI on the surface of basophils and mast cells, although the time course of this change may differ in the two cell types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/36-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of ragweed-allergic patients with allergic rhinitis, Fc-epsilon-RI on the surface of basophils was reduced by 73 percent after seven days of treatment and correlated with a decreased clinical response to allergen on nasal challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, the downregulation of receptors on cutaneous mast cells occurs more slowly.

The number of cells staining positive for tryptase was unchanged, demonstrating that the mast cells were still present, but receptor expression had decreased.

Disorders included transient ischemic attacks, cardiac ischemia, pulmonary hypertension, venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism. In 2014, the FDA released a statement based upon a combined analysis of 25 randomized trials comparing omalizumab with placebo, which did <strong>not </strong>detect an increased risk of thromboembolic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. However, the FDA noted that the low number of events, young population, and short duration of follow-up could have impaired the ability of the analysis to detect an increase in risk and recommended alterations in the safety labeling. A 2017 analysis of EXCELS data reported a higher incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular serious adverse events in omalizumab-treated patients, compared with non-omalizumab-treated patients (13.4 versus 8.1 per 1000 patient years), with a hazard ratio of 1.32 (95% CI, 0.91-1.91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis</strong> &ndash; Cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss) developing in temporal relationship with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> have been reported, although the coincident reduction in glucocorticoid therapy must also be considered as a possible contributing factor in expression of the disease.

However, a randomized trial of 137 people with allergic asthma who were at high risk for helminth infection and received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> or placebo for one year found a trend toward more infections in the omalizumab subjects, although the difference was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-ige-therapy/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].

The initiation of omalizumab in pregnant women is not recommended, although if a woman becomes pregnant while receiving omalizumab, it is suggested that therapy can be continued if the benefits are estimated to outweigh the potential harms. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) crosses the placenta, so the fetus of a woman receiving omalizumab would be exposed to the drug. In a 2009 review of completed studies of omalizumab therapy, 47 pregnancies had been reported among female participants, 27 of whom were receiving the active drug.

This binding inhibits the attachment of IgE to IgE receptors on mast cells, basophils, and other cell types, thereby reducing surface IgE receptor levels and the ability of these cells to be activated by allergens.
