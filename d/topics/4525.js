The water, cation, and anion contents are continuously regulated by the activity and interactions of several ion transport systems, as summarized in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62852\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62852 \">figure 1</a>). The importance of these systems is indicated by the various diseases occurring when red cell ion transport is impaired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80358\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80358 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The transport systems involved in regulating the volume and composition of red cells, and which affect the cation, anion, and water content of the red cell, will be discussed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A brief discussion of the role of ion transport in the pathogenesis of sickle cell disease will also be presented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Cation content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In human red cells (and other cells), the activity of the sodium-K-ATPase pump maintains a low sodium, high potassium milieu. The outward potassium gradient and the inward sodium gradient can be used by several passive (gradient-driven) transport systems, which are sensitive to changes in pH, volume, or membrane integrity.</p><p>Human red cells have a high content of total magnesium but a lower content of free magnesium. Magnesium is an important regulator of several cellular functions; its export from the red cells is regulated by a gradient-driven Na-Mg exchanger, while little is known about the mechanisms involved in controlling the entry of magnesium into the human erythrocyte.</p><p>A powerful membrane Ca-ATPase is responsible for the extremely low Ca content of human erythrocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Anion content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chloride content of the human red cell varies according to the cation content (permeant cations), the net charge of the non-permeant ions (eg, hemoglobin and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)), and intracellular pH. The chloride-bicarbonate anion exchanger (AE1 or band 3 protein) is the major pathway for the movement of these anions in human red cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Water content</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water can move across the red cell membrane by passive diffusion and also via a specific water channel aquaporin-1 (AQP-1), which is the prototype of the aquaporin family of transporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Passive diffusion and water channels allow the red cell to be in osmotic equilibrium with the plasma. As a result, the water content of the human red cell is determined by the intracellular sodium, potassium, and Cl content and the osmolality of the plasma. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Water channels'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ENERGY-DRIVEN SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two active transport systems in the red cell: the Na-K-ATPase pump and the calcium-ATPase pump.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">N-K-ATPase pump</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sodium-potassium ATPase is an enzyme formed by three subunits: the alpha-1 catalytic subunit (1020 amino acids) involved in ion transport, the beta-1 subunit (302 amino acids) involved in the interaction with membrane and cytoskeletal components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], and the gamma-1 proteolipid subunit. Each red cell contains a mean of 228 to 470 Na-K-ATPase units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The Na-K-ATPase pump extrudes sodium in exchange for potassium with a 3:2 stoichiometry. Tosteson and Hoffman provided theoretical and experimental evidence for the pump-leak model, which explains how active transport works in parallel with passive transport to determine the sodium and potassium content of cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The cell sodium content is determined by the balance between the entry of sodium and its active extrusion by the Na-K pump.</p><p>A demonstration of this model was provided by studies of the red cells of a patient with a 10 to 20-fold increase in the number of pump sites per cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The red cell membranes had normal passive permeability to sodium and, due to increased Na-K-ATPase activity, a reduction in the cell sodium concentration and an elevation in the cell potassium concentration were present.</p><p>Loss-of-function mutations in the nonerythroid alpha-2 subunit gene of the Na-K pump have been associated with familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], while missense mutations in the nonerythroid alpha-3 subunit gene have been associated with rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ca-ATPase pump</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The red cell membrane also contains a Ca-ATPase pump that maintains free cytosolic levels of calcium below 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;mol/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Calcium efflux via the Ca-ATPase pump takes place in conjunction with hydrogen influx, with a 1:1 stoichiometry between ATP consumption and calcium extrusion.</p><p>The intracellular calcium concentration is increased two- to threefold during deoxygenation in sickle cell anemia red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This change is associated with an increase in passive calcium influx and a reduction in Ca-ATPase pump activity. It may contribute to the sickling process by activating a major dehydration pathway via the calcium-sensitive potassium channel (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Calcium-activated potassium channel (Gardos channel)'</a> below).</p><p>There is great variability in the transport capacity of the Ca-ATPase pump within the same subject, with the presence of sub-populations of red cells in which the activity can vary six to ninefold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It has been shown that aging of normal human red cells is associated with a monotonic decrease in Ca-ATPase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PASSIVE GRADIENT-DRIVEN SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several passive, gradient-driven systems, including electroneutral cotransporters and ion- or water-specific channels, utilize the inward sodium and outward potassium gradients generated by the Na-K pump to transport ions across the red cell membrane. Because of the dependence upon the Na-K pump, this process is also called secondary active transport.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Na-K-Cl cotransport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Na-K-Cl cotransport was first described in human red cells in 1974 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and is widely distributed in other cell types, including the apical and basolateral membranes of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. The major erythroid form of this electroneutral transporter, called NKCC, has a 1Na:1K:2Cl stoichiometry. As with its counterpart in the basolateral membrane of the thick ascending limb, it is inhibited with high affinity by loop diuretics, which bind to the Cl site, and belongs to the family of cation-chloride cotransporters (CCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]; other members of this family are the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], the volume-sensitive K-Cl cotransporter (KCC), and the apical Na-K-Cl cotransporter of the renal thick limb NKCC2, which typically has a lower affinity for loop diuretics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In human red cells, Na-K-Cl cotransport results in a small net extrusion of sodium, potassium, and chloride under physiologic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It plays only a minor role in the regulation of human red cell volume.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">K-Cl cotransport</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electroneutral K-Cl cotransporter belongs to the family of chloride-cation transporters (CCC). At least four major isoforms of this transporter have been identified: KCC1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], KCC2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], KCC3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and KCC4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The importance of these transporters has been shown in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The KCC2 <span class=\"nowrap\">(-/-)</span> mouse dies perinatally due to respiratory failure induced by the loss of synaptic inhibitory input [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The KCC3 <span class=\"nowrap\">(-/-)</span> mouse shows impaired cell volume regulation in neurons and kidney tubular cells, with deafness, reduced seizure threshold, peripheral neurologic disease, and arterial hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human KCC3 mutations are associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum and peripheral neuropathy (ACCPN or Andermann syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The KCC4 <span class=\"nowrap\">(-/-)</span> mouse exhibits deafness and renal tubular acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>KCC isoforms 1, 3, and 4 are present in human erythrocytes. K-Cl cotransport mediates extrusion of potassium and chloride from the red cell (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62852\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62852 \">figure 1</a>). The functions of this transporter have been studied in several species (sheep, dog, and duck) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], in red cells of patients homozygous for hemoglobin C disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], in sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], thalassemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], and in normal human reticulocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>The most relevant functional properties of K-Cl cotransport are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume-dependence (with activation by cell swelling)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>pH-dependence (with optimum pH of 6.7 to 7.2)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition by intracellular magnesium and other divalent cations, including zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation by hydrostatic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation by urea and oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation by positively charged hemoglobin variants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/32,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,42-44</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Role in sickle erythrocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythrocyte dehydration is thought to play an important role in the pathophysiology of the chronic organ damage and acute vaso-occlusive events of sickle cell disease. Dehydrated cells have increased cellular hemoglobin (HbS) concentration, which in turn leads to a marked increase in the polymerization of HbS and sickling.</p><p>The K-Cl cotransport system plays an important role in the pathologic dehydration of sickle red cells, either alone or in conjunction with the calcium-activated potassium (Gardos) channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Calcium-activated potassium channel (Gardos channel)'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle hemoglobin polymer: Structure and functional properties&quot;, section on 'Sickle hemoglobin polymerization'</a>.)</p><p>It is believed that every time sickle erythrocytes are exposed to the renal medullary environment with high urea concentrations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to low pH, they lose potassium, chloride, and water via K-Cl cotransport. Sickle erythrocytes exhibit a marked increase in K-Cl cotransport, an effect that is most likely due to interaction between the relatively positively charged HbS and the cell membrane or the regulatory machinery of the transporter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], since this has also been shown for cells containing HbC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>K-Cl cotransport in normal erythrocytes is inhibited by low oxygen tension and is refractory to stimulation by low pH or urea; in contrast, the activity of the transporter in sickle erythrocytes is independent of oxygen tension and retains the ability to be activated by low pH and urea under hypoxic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. As a result, the K-Cl cotransporter in sickle erythrocytes can induce significant potassium, chloride, and water loss even at a low pO2 (as occurs, for example, in the renal medulla). In a transgenic mouse model of sickle cell disease, expression of an activated form of the K-Cl cotransporter <em>KCC1</em> was demonstrated to increase morbidity and mortality substantially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prevention of K-Cl cotransport-induced red cell dehydration is a potential therapeutic strategy for sickle cell disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary magnesium supplements (eg, magnesium pidolate, available over-the-counter in France and other European countries, but not available in the United States) have been used to increase red cell magnesium content, which impairs K-Cl cotransport and reduces dehydration of sickle cells with minimal side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. However, a trial of intravenous magnesium administration to treat acute painful episodes in sickle cell disease did not show a benefit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease#H2870181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Therapies we do not use'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-therapies-for-sickle-cell-disease#H1648547066\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational therapies for sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Reducing HbS polymerization'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, addition of a sulfhydryl-reducing agent normalized the sensitivity of K-Cl cotransport activity to urea in sickle cell red cells, mitigating the urea-stimulated volume decrease in sickle cell reticulocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. This observation suggests that the dysfunctional activity was due, in part, to reversible sulfhydryl oxidation, providing rationale for use of sulfhydryl reducing agents in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Na-H exchanger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The NHE1 sodium-hydrogen exchanger (or antiporter) transports sodium into cells in exchange for hydrogen and accounts for a small fraction of the passive sodium influx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In other cell types, but not in human red cells, Na-H exchange mediates the volume regulatory increase following hypertonic shrinkage and regulates cell pH.</p><p>Na-H exchange is functionally up-regulated in one form of genetically engineered murine spherocytosis, which lacks the cytoskeletal protein 4.1R, where it probably plays a role in determining the abnormally elevated cell Na content of the red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. 4.1R has been shown to bind and regulate NHE1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Na-Mg exchanger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sodium-magnesium exchanger (or antiporter) plays a crucial role in controlling red cell Mg content by exporting Mg from the erythrocyte in exchange for Na [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. This exchanger may be involved in generating the abnormally low Mg content observed in sickle erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The human gene SCL41A1 has been shown to encode for the Na-Mg exchanger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Anion exchanger (band 3)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The protein mediating anion exchange (band 3) in human red cells is encoded by the AE1 gene on human chromosome 17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The 95 kDa human anion exchanger-1 protein (AE1) has two main structural and functional domains: the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, involved in the interaction with the complex ankyrin, band 4.1, and band 4.2 and with hemoglobin and glycolytic enzymes; and the C-terminal membrane-spanning domain involved in ion transport. Each human red cell contains approximately 1.2 million copies of AE1 per cell.</p><p>The AE1 anion exchanger, which primarily functions as a chloride-bicarbonate exchanger, provides the basis for the high permeability of the red cells to chloride and bicarbonate ions. Its physiological function to facilitate CO2 transport from tissues to alveoli may be related to its ability to bind deoxyhemoglobin, but not oxyhemoglobin, with high affinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This interaction mediates the switch in glucose metabolism between the pentose phosphate and the glycolytic pathways, as well as ATP release from the red cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. It also plays an important role in defining red cell shape and membrane stability, as shown by the association of genetic defects in band 3 with hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary stomatocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-red-blood-cell-hydration/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].

The importance of these systems is indicated by the various diseases occurring when red cell ion transport is impaired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F80358\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80358 \">table 1</a>). The following systems are involved:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Water content</strong> &ndash; Water can move across the red cell membrane by passive diffusion and also via the specific water channel aquaporin-1. These allow the red cell to be in osmotic equilibrium with the plasma. As a result, the water content of the human red cell is determined by the intracellular sodium, potassium, and Cl content and the osmolality of the plasma. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Water content'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Water channels'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cation content</strong> &ndash; The low sodium, low calcium, and high potassium milieu of the red cell is maintained by the energy-driven Na-K-ATPase and Ca-ATPase pumps, and by the passive gradient-driven Na-K-Cl transport, K-Cl cotransport, Na-H exchanger, Na-Mg exchanger, Ca-activated potassium (Gardos) channels and possibly the mechanosensitive Piezo-1 channel.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anion content &ndash;</strong> The AE1 anion exchanger (band 3) primarily functions as a chloride-bicarbonate exchanger. Its physiological function to facilitate CO<sub>2</sub> transport from tissues to alveoli may be related to its ability to bind deoxyhemoglobin, but not oxyhemoglobin, with high affinity.
