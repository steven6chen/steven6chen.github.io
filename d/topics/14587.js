Recent observations have opened the broad field of acute risk to study and have highlighted the potential role of psychosocial factors in acute disease onset and prognosis after MI. As an example, ST elevation (Q-wave) MI is now recognized to be preceded by coronary thrombosis, which is in turn associated with plaque fissuring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Plaque disruption and thrombosis frequently occurs at the site of a previously mild stenosis, suggesting that the transformation from a stable to unstable plaque occurs acutely (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77739\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77739 \">algorithm 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

A meta-analysis of 66,635 patients with an acute MI and 19,390 patients with sudden death reported an excess of MIs (relative risk 1.38) and sudden deaths (relative risk 1.29) between the hours of 6 AM and noon compared with the rest of the day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56626%7ECARD%2F59140\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56626 graphicRef59140 \">figure 1A-B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The circadian variation in event frequency suggests that cardiac events may be triggered by external activities, particularly those activating the sympathetic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Support for this comes from one study of 1225 patients which reported an absence of a circadian variation in diabetics, particularly those with evidence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy who have absent heart rate variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and those taking beta blockers or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> at the time of admission for an MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Among patients with stable coronary heart disease, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity peaks in the early morning while tissue plasminogen activator activity is at its nadir; treatment with a beta blocker ameliorated this relatively prothrombotic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Other studies have identified possible triggers in up to 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Life events and other crises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a large cohort of middle-aged widowers, for example, a 40 percent increase in the mortality rate in the first six months was observed following bereavement; more than half of which was attributed to cardiovascular causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is unclear how much of this increase in mortality was due to lifestyle changes during the grieving period rather than to stress per se. Additional information about the association between grief and increased mortality is discussed separately.

In contrast, the San Francisco earthquake of 1989, which occurred in the afternoon, was not associated with an increase in acute MIs; these data suggest that an MI is more likely to occur if an extreme emotional stress is superimposed upon the normal circadian pattern or a second trigger, such as abrupt awakening in the morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the initial eight days after six blizzards in Massachusetts from 1974 to 1978, a 22 percent increase in ischemic deaths per day was reported in comparison to preceding and subsequent control weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the six weeks immediately following the Hanshin-Awaji, Japan earthquake there were 10 cardiovascular or sudden deaths compared with three during the same period in the previous year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A study of 42 elderly patients with well controlled hypertension who lived near the epicenter reported that one to two weeks after the earthquake (when aftershocks were frequent), there were transient increases in blood pressure, blood viscosity determinants, and fibrin turnover.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 1991 Iraq war also provided an opportunity to study the cardiovascular effects of psychological stress.

At a mean follow-up of 21 years, 2731 patients (20 percent) suffered a first cardiovascular event (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke, angina pectoris, or acute coronary syndrome). The risk of a first cardiovascular event was significantly higher for those with moderate or high stress, though the magnitude of the increase was small (adjusted risk ratio 1.14). For women analyzed separately, there was no increase in risk after adjustment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report comparing 130 patients with an acute MI or unstable angina to 102 control subjects hospitalized for acute trauma found that cardiac patients had higher levels of social isolation, self-blame and avoidance, and more painful life experiences compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Patients with a first MI reported significantly more stress in each of these categories than controls. The proportion of MI patients experiencing moderate or severe work or home stress varied widely among regions, from 43.8 percent in North America to 15.6 percent in China and Hong Kong.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Personality and mood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of the role of personality in the etiology of coronary artery disease have yielded controversial results. However, there is increasing evidence that hostility, cynicism, and anger form a critical &quot;toxic&quot; component of type A behavior that is associated with enhanced cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Anxiety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anxiety as a cardiovascular risk factor has not been studied as extensively as other psychosocial factors.

Several potential mechanisms have been proposed; however, their relative contribution requires further elucidation. The potential mechanisms include hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction, inflammatory and prothrombotic changes, dietary factors, low omega-3 fatty acid levels, reduced heart rate variability and adverse behavior including medication nonadherence, smoking, and physical inactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following studies support the relationship between depression and cardiovascular disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest analysis of this issue comes from data on over 93,000 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years participating in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. At baseline, 16 percent of study participants were found to be currently depressed and 12 percent to have a history of depression. At four years, patients with current or previous depression had significantly higher rates of cardiovascular death (0.79 versus 0.52 percent) and all-cause mortality (2.87 versus 2.18 percent) than those without depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the worldwide INTERHEART study, depression was significantly more common among patients with a first MI than among controls (24.0 versus 17.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Heart and Soul study of patients with stable coronary artery disease, baseline depressive symptoms assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) were predictive of subsequent age-adjusted annualized cardiovascular events (10 percent for PHQ score &ge;10 versus 6.7 percent without depressive symptoms, hazard ratio 1.5, p = 0.002). Adjustment for biological factors attenuated the association, which was no longer significant after further adjustment for potential behavioral mediators, in particular physical inactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These findings suggest the need for further investigation of exercise as a possible intervention to ameliorate the link between depression and cardiovascular risk.</p><p/><p>The severity of depression has also been correlated with cardiovascular risk. This was illustrated in a prospective cohort of 4493 elderly subjects (&ge;65 years of age) in the Cardiovascular Health Study who were initially free of cardiovascular disease at baseline and were followed for six years, found that each five-unit increase in depression score was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.15 and 1.16 for the development of coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Those with the highest depression scores had a 40 and 60 percent increased risk of coronary disease and death compared with those with the lowest scores. A similar graded relationship was noted for the occurrence of MI in the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area study; the relationship was independent of coronary risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>A more complex relationship was noted in the Systolic Hypertension in older adults Program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In this trial, 4736 subjects aged 60 years or more with isolated systolic hypertension were followed for an average of 4.5 years, with depressive symptoms being assessed by six-month questionnaires. Baseline levels of depressive symptoms did not predict future cardiovascular events; however there was an increase in depression score prior to MI, stroke or death. One study found that in men, but not women, over 70 years the recent onset of depression, but not chronic depression, was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality (relative risk 1.75), cardiovascular and coronary heart disease events (relative risk 2.07 and 2.03, respectively), and all-cause mortality (relative risk 1.4) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64348\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64348 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Anger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anger appears to have a deleterious effect on the cardiovascular system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Patients with trait anger have a relatively stable personality, but manifest rage and fury more often, more intensely, and have longer-lasting episodes. The relationship between anger and coronary heart disease was evaluated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities trial of 12,986 men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Compared to normotensive subjects with low trait anger, normotensive subjects with high trait anger were at higher risk for all coronary heart disease events, including acute MI, cardiac mortality, silent MI, or coronary revascularization (hazard ratio 2.2), and for hard cardiac events of acute MI or cardiac mortality (hazard ratio 2.7).

The level of anger corresponded on a scale to the subjects feeling &quot;very angry, body tense, clenching fists or teeth.&quot; The most frequent causes of anger were arguments with family members (25 percent), conflicts at work (22 percent), and legal problems (8 percent).

After a median follow-up of 36 years, those with the highest level of anger, compared with those with lower levels, had an increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease developing before the age of 55 (adjusted relative risk 3.1), coronary heart disease (adjusted relative risk 3.5), and MI (relative risk 6.4).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Seasonal pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several series have demonstrated a seasonal pattern of deaths from MI, with more fatal events (20 to 30 percent variation) occurring in the winter than the summer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. As an example, a recent report from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction evaluated 259,891 cases of acute MI from 1474 hospitals during a 25-month period; approximately 53 percent more MIs occurred in the winter or spring compared with the summer (p &lt;0.05) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82538\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82538 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The trends were independent of gender, geographic location, age, and the type of MI (ST elevation or non-ST elevation). In-hospital fatality rates for MI also followed a seasonal pattern, with a peak of 9 percent in winter and a nadir in the spring (8.4 percent). However, a seasonal pattern is absent in diabetics or those taking beta blockers or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, suggesting an important role for the sympathetic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A similar association between the season and death from MI was also noted in another study of 300,000 deaths from MI or stroke in the Canadian Mortality database; however, in this study there was a relationship between mortality and age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-factors-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].
