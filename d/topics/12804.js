Intact phrenic nerve function is required for effective pacing. The typical approach has been to pace the diaphragm via stimulation of the phrenic nerve at the level of the neck or thorax. However, pacing of the phrenic nerve at the level of the diaphragm may also be used in some patients.</p><p>Patient selection, evaluation for pacemaker candidacy, implantation technique, postoperative recovery, and complications of pacemaker placement will be reviewed here. The etiology, diagnosis, and management of patients with bilateral and unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are discussed separately.

This population of patients has traditionally been ventilated invasively with a mechanical ventilator, or noninvasively with positive pressure support. However, diaphragmatic pacing can be used in a select group of patients who cannot tolerate, have a desire to be liberated from, or have a desire to delay the need for noninvasive or invasive ventilatory support, the details of which are discussed in the sections below. (See <a href=\"#H277252\" class=\"local\">'Upper cervical spinal cord injury (above C3)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H277264\" class=\"local\">'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2764172470\" class=\"local\">'Other patient populations'</a> below.)</p><p>Importantly, <span class=\"nowrap\">paralysis/paresis</span> of the diaphragm can be due to muscle, nerve, or central nervous system disease, and only patients with intact phrenic nerve function are amenable to pacing. Notably, diaphragmatic pacing should be avoided in patients with evidence of a denervated diaphragm. (See <a href=\"#H277252\" class=\"local\">'Upper cervical spinal cord injury (above C3)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H277264\" class=\"local\">'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2764172470\" class=\"local\">'Other patient populations'</a> below.)</p><p>It should be recognized by physicians and patients that only small case series have demonstrated benefits from diaphragmatic pacing including a reduction or a delay in the need for ventilatory support. Randomized trials are needed to validate these and other clinically important outcomes, including the effect of pacing on lung function and overall survival, compared with standard forms of ventilatory support (invasive or noninvasive ventilation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory complications in the adult patient with chronic spinal cord injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-physiologic-changes-following-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory physiologic changes following spinal cord injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The biologic rationale for pacing in this population is that phrenic nerve function is usually intact and can be stimulated at the level of the neck, thorax, and diaphragm. The nerve cell bodies of the phrenic nerve are located in the anterior horns of C3 to C5. Thus, ideal candidates are those with injury above C3 (ie, a central cause for bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis). In contrast, patients with trauma to the midcervical spine (C3 through C5) or with concurrent direct trauma to the phrenic nerve (eg, ischemia or crush injury) are less suitable as candidates for phrenic nerve pacing because phrenic nerve function at the lower motor neuron level is disrupted. Importantly, the diaphragm <strong>cannot</strong> be paced if it is completely denervated. The assessment of phrenic nerve function is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Intact phrenic nerve function'</a> below.)</p><p>Traditionally, the diaphragm was paced in this population using phrenic nerve stimulation at the level of the neck (cervical approach) or thorax (thoracic approach). A more advanced technique of stimulating the phrenic nerve at the level of the diaphragm (direct diaphragmatic pacing stimulation; DPS) has since been reported in this population. Data that supports each of these approaches include the following (see <a href=\"#H182312341\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> below): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cervical or thoracic approach</strong> &ndash; The efficacy of bilateral phrenic nerve stimulation at the cervical or thoracic level is derived from case reports and retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/2-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-10</a>]. As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One center reviewed their experience with phrenic nerve stimulation in 22 children and young adults, most of whom had ventilatory failure secondary to high level SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Successful pacing of the diaphragm was reported for 11 years in one patient, 10 years in four patients, and five years or less for 17 patients. Only two patients failed all efforts at diaphragmatic pacing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Another single center study of 20 patients with posttraumatic quadriplegia reported that 18 patients were successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation with phrenic nerve stimulation performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A 15-year retrospective analysis of 12 quadriplegic patients who underwent cervical or thoracic phrenic nerve pacemaker placement reported that, despite prior concerns, chronic pacing was <strong>not</strong> associated with progressive phrenic nerve damage or loss of diaphragmatic function over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Half of the patients were paced for 15 years with the remainder undergoing pacing for two years or more. Pacing was well tolerated, and reasons for discontinuation included intercurrent medical illness and lack of social support. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diaphragmatic approach</strong> &ndash; Preliminary studies report successful phrenic nerve stimulation at the diaphragmatic level (ie, DPS) in patients with upper level SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. Stimulation at this level is directed to phrenic nerve branches at their points of insertion into the diaphragm; the muscle is not stimulated directly. As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One multicenter prospective evaluation of a laparoscopic DPS system was conducted in 50 adults with upper level SCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Time from SCI to implantation ranged from three months to 27 years. There were no perioperative deaths or infections. DPS resulted in adequate diaphragmatic contraction in all patients and reduced the time spent on mechanical ventilation (decrease by four or more hours). Almost half of the group was weaned off ventilatory support completely. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A retrospective multicenter study of 22 patients with upper level SCI treated with DPS within 40 days of the original injury reported that most patients (76 percent) were ventilator-free after ten days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. One-third of patients had resumption of spontaneous breathing over a similar time period such that pacing was no longer required. These data should be interpreted with caution as most patients were paced within the first three months following injury, a period during which spontaneous recovery of phrenic nerve function may have occurred. &#160; </p><p/><p>Phrenic nerve stimulation has been combined with intercostal nerve stimulation as a means to augment inspiratory effort in quadriplegic patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis who have only one functionally intact phrenic nerve (ie, only one diaphragm can be paced). One case series studied unilateral phrenic nerve stimulation (using the thoracic approach) <strong>combined</strong> with bilateral intercostal nerve stimulation in four quadriplegic patients who only had one functionally intact phrenic nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The combination resulted in increased maximum inspired volume such that all patients could be maintained off mechanical ventilation for 16 to 24 hours a day. Intercostal muscle pacing requires intact intercostal nerve function and a hemilaminectomy to access the thoracic spinal cord where the nerve roots are located. Intercostal muscle pacing with or without concurrent phrenic nerve stimulation remains investigational. </p><p>Pacing devices for each approach are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in patients with upper level SCI who have ventilatory failure due to bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. </p><p>The surgical implantation of cervical, thoracic, and diaphragmatic pacemakers are described separately.

With disease progression, the lower motor neurons that innervate the diaphragm via the phrenic nerve degenerate, resulting in muscle denervation and diaphragmatic paresis and paralysis. Thus, this population is not suitable for diaphragmatic pacing via the thoracic or cervical approach since the phrenic nerve conduction is not fully intact.

We believe that patients with ALS are <strong>not</strong> suitable candidates for DPS. This belief is based upon the rationale that not only is it not a viable strategy if the number of innervated muscle fibers is insufficient to drive contraction of the diaphragm, data derived from two randomized trials have reported potential harm in association with its use. Data that describe the use of DPS in patients with ALS include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/11,24,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,24,26-28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two randomized trials showed no benefit or harm associated with DPS:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One multicenter randomized trial of 74 patients with respiratory failure from ALS reported reduced survival when DPS was used in combination with NIV compared with patients treated with NIV alone (11 versus 23 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

There were no device-related major adverse events, and DPS resulted in thicker diaphragms (3.9 versus 4.8 mm) and a slower decline in FVC (-2.4 versus -1.3 percent predicted per month).

For example, when compared with patients with upper level SCI, DPS-induced diaphragmatic contraction is typically weaker in patients with ALS because of progressive muscle atrophy, suggesting that this population is less responsive to pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

These include the demonstration of apnea or severe hypoventilation from diaphragmatic paralysis or paresis, as well as the demonstration of intact phrenic nerve function. (See <a href=\"#H29484904\" class=\"local\">'Apnea or severe hypoventilation due to diaphragmatic dysfunction'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Intact phrenic nerve function'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, patients should be assessed for medical issues that may increase surgical complications or limit the potential benefit from pacing. (See <a href=\"#H29485758\" class=\"local\">'General medical issues'</a> below.)</p><p>The timing of the evaluation should be individualized according to the population studied. In general, patients with upper level spinal cord injury are evaluated three months or more following the initial injury because spontaneous phrenic nerve recovery may occur during this period.

As an example, benefits such as phonation and olfaction are not feasible in patients who are severely neurocognitively impaired, in a coma, or obtunded. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absence of severe underlying primary pulmonary disease</strong> &ndash; Diaphragmatic pacing is contraindicated in patients with severe underlying lung disease because ventilatory impairment in this population is typically not responsive to this intervention. Patients should be assessed for evidence of prior pulmonary disease by performing a thorough history and examination, obtaining prior and current chest imaging, and pulmonary function testing (when feasible). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-physiologic-changes-following-spinal-cord-injury#H12087727\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory physiologic changes following spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Assessment of pulmonary function'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Good chest wall mechanics</strong> &ndash; Cases have been reported of failure of diaphragmatic pacing due to rib cage stiffening from ankylosing spondylitis. Patients should be assessed to assure normal chest wall movement. Obesity leading to excessive mechanical inspiratory loads also has been cited as a cause for DPS failure, and some suggest that obesity should be considered a contraindication to pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/22,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absence of contraindications to surgery</strong> &ndash; A comprehensive history and examination should be performed to evaluate patients for medical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical contraindications to cervical, thoracic, or laparoscopic abdominal surgery when choosing cervical, thoracic, or direct diaphragmatic pacing, respectively. Each approach has an associated risk, the details of which are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-minimally-invasive-thoracic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of minimally invasive thoracic surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Patient age is not considered an exclusion criterion, such that children and adults may be candidates for pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, a lengthy period of time from injury to pacing (among those with spinal cord injury) is not considered an absolute contraindication. Clinical experience and case reports demonstrate phrenic nerve recovery by two to three years following injury as well as successful pacing in those in whom injury occurred many years prior (up to 27 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/2,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,37</a>]. </p><p>Although the presence of a cardiac pacemaker or a feeding tube may make pacemaker placement technically more challenging, neither are considered a contraindication to pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328153584\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal timing of the evaluation is unknown. For patients with upper level spinal cord injury, most experts agree that a minimum of three months should elapse following the initial injury before performing a formal evaluation, particularly for functional testing of the phrenic nerve. The rationale for this approach is that phrenic nerve function may partially or completely recover in the weeks following injury in conjunction with recovery of the patient&rsquo;s medical condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/2,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,38-41</a>]. Some patients may resume spontaneous breathing and reduce or eliminate the need for mechanical ventilation during this period. Clinical experience and small case series also suggest that some patients may benefit from periodic retesting of the phrenic nerve up to two or three years after the injury to determine whether or not late recovery has occurred, but this is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

For example, these goals may not be achieved in patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis who are only eligible for unilateral phrenic nerve stimulation, or in patients with severe malnutrition, multiple comorbidities (eg, aphasic stroke), poor motivation, or poor psychosocial support. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient values and preferences </strong>&ndash; For patients and clinicians to make an informed decision, the benefits of diaphragmatic pacing listed above (eg, independence and phonation) should be weighed against the disadvantages of pacing which include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complications of the surgery and the pacemaker (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Potential for catastrophic effects of sudden hardware malfunction, and consequently, the continued need in many patients for a tracheostomy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tracheostomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tracheostomy&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Continued need for assistance with cough and secretion clearance (diaphragmatic pacing improves inspiratory effort but it has no effect on the muscles of expiration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous noninvasive ventilatory support for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Cough assistance'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;, section on 'Expiratory aids'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The cost</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three locations for phrenic nerve stimulation: the neck (cervical approach), the chest (thoracic approach), and the diaphragm (diaphragmatic approach; diaphragmatic pacing stimulation [DPS]). For cervical and thoracic approaches, two electrodes are needed, one for the right and the other for the left phrenic nerve. For the diaphragmatic approach, typically four electrodes are needed (one for each point of insertion on the diaphragm). Patient selection for specific approaches and details of each surgical technique are discussed in the sections below.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H573440404\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of approach/pacemaker type</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H573440411\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with upper level spinal cord injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with upper level spinal cord injury (ie, above the third cervical level) are suitable candidates for all three approaches (cervical, thoracic, diaphragmatic). The rationale and data that support the efficacy of pacing in this population are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H277252\" class=\"local\">'Upper cervical spinal cord injury (above C3)'</a> above.) </p><p>Choosing among the options is usually individualized and dependent upon institutional expertise. The advantages and disadvantages associated with each approach can be used to facilitate this choice. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The advantage of the cervical approach is that it avoids the morbidity and mortality associated with chest surgery that are required for the thoracic approach. In addition, bilateral phrenic nerve electrodes can be placed with one operative procedure, rather than the two procedures that are needed for thoracic pacemaker implantation. The second procedure is usually performed two weeks later after recovery from the first procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The disadvantage of the cervical approach is that, in a small proportion of patients, the amplitude of current necessary to stimulate the phrenic nerve results in transmission of current through the soft tissues. This stimulates the functioning portions of the brachial plexus, leading to rhythmic jerking motions of the upper extremities. (See <a href=\"#H29484851\" class=\"local\">'Complications of cervical pacemakers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main advantage of the thoracic approach is that it avoids brachial plexus stimulation associated with the cervical approach. It is also thought that the pacing stimulus is more effective when using the thoracic approach because a lower branch of the phrenic nerve joins the main nerve trunk only after it enters the chest cavity. As a result, a larger portion of the phrenic nerve may be stimulated by the thoracic approach. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The disadvantage of the thoracic approach is the greater associated morbidity and mortality, particularly if an open thoracotomy needs to be performed. (See <a href=\"#H1831305\" class=\"local\">'Complications of thoracic pacemakers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main advantages of direct diaphragmatic pacing (DPS) are that it is performed laparoscopically, device implantation can be performed in one procedure, and it avoids brachial plexus stimulation as well as the potential for phrenic nerve damage that is associated with both the cervical and thoracic approaches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, compared to the cervical and thoracic approach, patients are at risk of the complications of laparoscopy including viscus and diaphragmatic perforation. In addition, expertise with this approach is limited to a small number of centers. (See <a href=\"#H29484857\" class=\"local\">'Complications of direct diaphragmatic pacemakers'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H573440425\"><span class=\"h3\">Other patient populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to patients with upper level spinal cord injury, patients with a central cause for their diaphragmatic paralysis are suitable candidates for cervical and thoracic pacing systems, and theoretically for diaphragmatic pacemakers. Similarly, patients with lower motor neuron diseases other than ALS (eg, idiopathic or trauma-related phrenic nerve neuropathy) may be candidates for direct diaphragm pacing stimulation. However, there is a paucity of evidence to support these indications. (See <a href=\"#H2764172470\" class=\"local\">'Other patient populations'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cervical and thoracic phrenic nerve stimulation is not effective. Direct diaphragmatic pacing (DPS) may be feasible if there are a sufficient number of functional phrenic nerve motor fibers at their points of insertion into the diaphragm. However, DPS is potentially harmful in patients with ALS and not recommended at this time.

Details of the techniques and instruments used in intra-abdominal laparoscopic surgery are discussed separately.

The diaphragm is then formally &lsquo;mapped&rsquo; to identify rapid motor points of maximal contraction for optimal placement of the stimulating electrodes. Mapping involves both qualitative (ie, direct visualization) and quantitative (changes in abdominal pressure) assessment of diaphragm contraction. In addition, identifying motor points for posterior leaflet contraction is important for the avoidance of postoperative lobar collapse and atelectasis. Once the sites are identified, two electrodes are placed on each diaphragmatic leaflet (anterior and posterior) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77888\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77888 \">figure 6</a>). Connecting wires are brought out through the epigastric port and tunneled to a receiver that is created in a subcutaneous pocket located in the chest or abdomen. The connections are made, the pacemaker is tested to ensure good diaphragmatic contraction, and wounds are closed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H182312382\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraoperative anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because visualization or imaging of diaphragmatic contraction is required intraoperatively, neuromuscular blocking agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vecuronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vecuronium</a>) and long acting muscle relaxants (eg, valium) should be avoided in most patients during diaphragmatic pacemaker surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>].

In contrast, most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can be extubated postoperatively, although some will require short periods of mechanical ventilation or noninvasive pressure support in the immediate postoperative period. </p><p>After two weeks, patients can begin an escalating regimen of diaphragmatic pacing to strengthen and condition the diaphragm, the details of which are discussed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDITIONING OF THE DIAPHRAGM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every patient should undergo a period of diaphragmatic conditioning. Conditioning is required because in patients with diaphragmatic <span class=\"nowrap\">paralysis/paresis,</span> the diaphragm undergoes disuse atrophy, a feature that is particularly prominent in those who have had <span class=\"nowrap\">paralysis/paresis</span> for prolonged periods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1312515\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial pacemaker settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with upper level spinal cord injury, an initial amplitude setting of three to six milliamps (mA) is usually required to provide a tidal volume that is 15 percent above basal need, particularly if the patient has had no diaphragmatic function for six months or more (basal need is typically 5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span>. </p><p>In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, there is less disuse atrophy, and therefore higher initial amplitudes can be tolerated. We suggest an initial amplitude setting of 25 mA, a frequency below 20 Hertz, and pulse width below 200 microseconds. &#160;</p><p>Settings can be altered to optimize ventilation and gas exchange while simultaneously avoiding patients discomfort during the diaphragmatic conditioning period, the details of which are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Conditioning of the diaphragm'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1312603\"><span class=\"h2\">Conditioning regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conditioning may begin immediately after surgery but we typically wait for a period of healing around the nerve to occur for one to two weeks prior to starting a conditioning regimen. Conditioning takes weeks to months but may be prolonged (six months to one year) in those in whom diaphragmatic paralysis was present for two years or more prior to pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications/abstract/3,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,51,52</a>]. Pacemaker settings are adjusted according to parameters that indicate adequate minute ventilation (tidal volume x respiratory rate), adequate gas exchange, and comfort level. Conditioning can occur at home or as an inpatient in a rehabilitation facility depending upon the comfort level of staff and caregivers with the equipment. </p><p>The regimen for diaphragm conditioning should be individualized as it varies from patient to patient and with the population studied. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with spinal cord injury, we use the following regimen:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pacing should commence slowly with a set duration of pacing time allocated to each hour during waking hours (eg, five minutes per hour while awake followed by 10 to 12 hours of nocturnal rest on mechanical ventilation). The pacing duration is extended on a daily or weekly basis (eg, 10 minutes per hour, 15 minutes per hour, etc) during waking hours until the patient is ventilator-free for the maximum amount of time that it is tolerated. The goal is to be ventilator-free for at least the awake period of the day and preferably for 24 hours a day. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The patient should be monitored during pacing for respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, as well as for comfort level and pain. The tidal volume of a paced breath should also be followed intermittently to ensure that the minimum target goal of 15 percent above the basal tidal volume is reached (basal tidal volume is usually 5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulse oximetry and arterial blood gases are monitored frequently (eg, initially daily and eventually weekly). In our experience, hypercapnia is one of the more common problems encountered during the conditioning period and may be responsible for the feeling of dyspnea during the transition period. It can usually be avoided by adjusting the ventilatory rate on the pacemaker. Alternatively, some experts will reduce the respiratory rate and tidal volume on the mechanical ventilator for several days prior to the initiation of pacing. This allows mild permissive hypercapnia and bicarbonate buffering, which resets central chemoreceptors, thereby avoiding acute hypercapnic acidosis during pacing hours and reducing the sensation of dyspnea. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although many patients may be weaned off ventilatory support for 24 hours a day, some only partially meet this goal and still require a tracheostomy for supplementary ventilation. For those who successfully wean off completely, many need a tracheostomy as a backup in the event of equipment failure. For those who choose to remove their tracheostomy, an Ambu bag should be available for the same reason. Once a plateau is reached settings can be altered according to planned daily activities. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of diaphragmatic pacing include those related to the surgery and those related to the pacing system.

Importantly, <span class=\"nowrap\">paralysis/paresis</span> of the diaphragm can be due to muscle, nerve, or central system disease, and only patients with intact phrenic nerve function are amenable to pacing. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Selection of potential candidates'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diaphragm can be paced using phrenic nerve stimulation at the level of the neck (cervical approach), thorax (thoracic approach), or diaphragm (direct diaphragmatic pacing stimulation [DPS]). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Surgical technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with apnea due to bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis from complete upper cervical spinal cord injury (SCI, above the third cervical level) are the most suitable candidates for diaphragmatic pacing. Traditionally, cervical or thoracic pacemakers have been used in this population; however, DPS is also feasible. (See <a href=\"#H277252\" class=\"local\">'Upper cervical spinal cord injury (above C3)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H573440404\" class=\"local\">'Selection of approach/pacemaker type'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with central causes for bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis other than upper level SCI, or patients with select lower motor neuron disorders (with the exception of ALS) may be candidates for diaphragmatic pacing (cervical, thoracic, diaphragmatic) or for DPS, respectively. Data to support pacing in these populations are limited. (See <a href=\"#H2764172470\" class=\"local\">'Other patient populations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H573440404\" class=\"local\">'Selection of approach/pacemaker type'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who have ventilatory failure due to severe bilateral paresis of the diaphragm are <strong>not</strong> suitable candidates for diaphragmatic pacing (cervical, thoracic, diaphragmatic). Some trials have suggested harm in association with DPS in this population and until future trials show clear benefit we prefer to avoid DPS in this population. (See <a href=\"#H277264\" class=\"local\">'Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H573440404\" class=\"local\">'Selection of approach/pacemaker type'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients are evaluated at specialized centers with expertise in diaphragmatic pacing. In order to ensure successful pacing, clinicians should demonstrate <span class=\"nowrap\">apnea/severe</span> hypoventilation from diaphragmatic <span class=\"nowrap\">paralysis/paresis</span> and a functionally intact phrenic nerve. Clinicians should also identify medical conditions that may limit the potential benefit of pacing. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients, pacing improves diaphragmatic function. In some patients it reduces the time spent on mechanical ventilation (eg, patients with spinal cord injury) thereby allowing phonation and improving quality of life. However, it has not been conclusively shown to improve survival.

The electrode is connected to a subcutaneous receiver. An external transmitting box emits radiofrequency signals to the receiver via an antenna that is taped over the surface of the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F97707\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97707 \">figure 1</a>).
