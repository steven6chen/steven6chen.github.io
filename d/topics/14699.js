Q fever can present as an acute or more chronic disease.</p><p>Persistent localized infections (eg, endocarditis, infection of aneurysms or vascular grafts, bone and joint infections) can develop in a patient after symptomatic acute Q fever or following asymptomatic infection. Endocarditis, which is the most common manifestation among those with persistent infection, can be severe and even fatal. However, diagnosing Q fever endocarditis is difficult and primarily relies upon nonspecific cardiac findings, the presence of peripheral manifestations (eg, liver, kidney, and splenic involvement), the results of serologic or molecular tests, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the findings on imaging studies. </p><p>This topic reviews the diagnosis and treatment of patients with endocarditis associated with persistent Q fever infection. Discussions of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of acute Q fever (including endocarditis associated with acute infection), as well as an overview of culture-negative endocarditis, are found elsewhere.

However, only 20 to 40 percent of patients who develop endocarditis have symptoms of acute infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-q-fever#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Q fever&quot;, section on 'Acute infection'</a>.)</p><p>Q fever endocarditis occurs primarily in men over the age of 40, and in those who are immunocompromised, pregnant, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have underlying valvular damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 302 patients diagnosed with acute Q fever, which noted the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-existing valvular disease was much more common in the 102 patients who developed endocarditis compared with those who did not develop endocarditis (93 versus 3 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated risk of endocarditis was 39 percent among patients who had preexisting valve disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the seven patients with endocarditis but no valvulopathy, five had active cancer.</p><p/><p>Among patients with valvulopathy, the underlying heart disease may be congenital, rheumatic, degenerative, or syphilitic. Some patients who develop Q fever endocarditis after symptomatic acute Q fever have clinically silent and previously undiagnosed valve disease. As an example, in a cohort study of 72 patients with acute Q fever, approximately 30 percent had undiagnosed valvulopathy when Q fever was diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1086871415\" class=\"local\">'Preventive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of subacute or chronic Q fever endocarditis has changed over time. Patients currently present with less severe disease, due perhaps to earlier diagnosis of the infection. As an example, patients who presented with endocarditis in 1999 to 2000 had less severe disease manifestations and a decreased interval to diagnosis (mean of six months) compared with those who were diagnosed in 1987 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Nevertheless, Q fever endocarditis remains a very serious consequence of acute infection, with one long-term survey reporting a mortality rate of approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H313806\"><span class=\"h2\">Constitutional symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients present with constitutional symptoms, which may include malaise, weakness, weight loss, fatigue, chills, anorexia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> night sweats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. Fever is present at the beginning of the disease in two-thirds of cases.

Findings include splenomegaly, digital clubbing, and a purpuric rash. The rash generally occurs on the extremities and the mucosa (eg, conjunctivae). When biopsied, the purpuric lesions show an immune complex vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Other manifestations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatomegaly &#9472; The liver is generally hard and may be considerably enlarged. Most cases of Q fever hepatitis in patients with persistent infection are associated with endocarditis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal involvement &#9472; The renal manifestations of Q fever endocarditis include microscopic hematuria, which occurs in up to one-half of patients, and renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As in other forms of endocarditis, the most frequent pathologic finding is an immune complex glomerulonephritis, which, if the diagnosis is delayed, can lead to significant kidney injury. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolic manifestations &#9472; Emboli commonly occur and may be recurrent. The emboli can involve cerebral or peripheral vessels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and outcome of infective endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Although uncommon, pulmonary and pleural manifestations may be observed as a complication of Q fever endocarditis. Neurologic manifestations are rare except for embolic stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY DATA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory findings are largely nonspecific. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is usually elevated. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hematuria are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>]. Other frequent findings include elevations in serum aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase, and globulins.</p><p>There are also several serum markers that are not specific for Q fever, but are often seen in individuals with Q fever endocarditis. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hyperglobulinemia</strong> &mdash; Hypergammaglobulinemia can support a diagnosis of Q fever endocarditis, especially when the globulins represent more than 50 percent of the total protein concentration. The longer the diagnostic delay, the higher the globulin concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoantibodies </strong>&mdash; Rheumatoid factor, as detected by the latex test, is frequently present, as are circulating immune complexes and cryoglobulins. Antismooth muscle antibodies (in low titers), antiphospholipid antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies, and a positive Coombs test have also been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. High levels of anticardiolipin antibodies have been associated with the rapid progression from acute Q fever to endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A discussion of antiphospholipid antibodies and endocarditis associated with acute Q fever is found elsewhere.

These pathologic features can be confused with noninfectious valvular degenerative damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H280550874\"><span class=\"h1\">ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with subacute or chronic infection, vegetative lesions are rarely visualized by either transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The mitral and aortic valves are most commonly affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. When lesions are present, they are often small, can be difficult to detect, and are often missed. Other echocardiographic findings include valvular thickening, calcification, cardiac abscess, stenosis, prosthetic leakage or avulsion, or pericardial effusion. As with the diagnosis of endocarditis due to other pathogens, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more sensitive that transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), but both modalities have limited sensitivity in Q fever endocarditis.

This delay often results from the presence of non-specific symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs, serial negative conventional blood cultures, and vegetations that are rarely seen by echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a 1995 review, the mean reported interval from onset to diagnosis was 12 to 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, a subsequent study found that the time to diagnosis had decreased to a mean of six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>We initiate an evaluation for Q fever endocarditis in the following patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with a recent history of acute Q fever, especially among those with underlying valvular diseases, as well as those who are pregnant or immunocompromised. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients without a history of acute Q fever but who have risk-factors for <em>C. burnetii</em> infection (eg, persons in contact with farm animals; individuals living downwind from farms and contaminated manure, straw, or dust; laboratory personnel working with <em>C. burnetii</em>; abattoir workers) <strong>and</strong> who present with the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Culture negative endocarditis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=culture-negative-endocarditis-epidemiology-microbiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Culture-negative endocarditis: Epidemiology, microbiology, and diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nonspecific findings (eg, constitutional symptoms, hepatomegaly, hematuria) of unclear etiology and valvular abnormalities (see <a href=\"#H1086871214\" class=\"local\">'Non-cardiac manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H313806\" class=\"local\">'Constitutional symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H280550874\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiographic findings'</a> above)</p><p/><p>The initial assessment for Q fever endocarditis includes a combination of laboratory and imaging studies.

In addition, patients should be informed about photosensitivity associated with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and counselled to take appropriate protective measures (eg, hat, long sleeved shirts, sunscreen). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1382850257\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients usually become afebrile within one week of initiating effective antibiotic therapy. The peripheral manifestations (eg, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly) disappear slowly within 2 to 12 weeks. Other parameters such as elevated serum aminotransferases and thrombocytopenia also slowly return to normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1382850263\"><span class=\"h3\">Serologic response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic testing should be performed during therapy. We usually obtain titers after one month and then every three months after that. The serum levels of antibodies decrease very slowly. IgM antibodies, when present, disappear first and then IgA; however, IgG antibodies remain positive for years. Serologic testing is used to help determine the ultimate duration of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1139224381\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The minimum duration of therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> is 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>]. For those with prosthetic valves, we usually treat for 24 months. Treatment can then be stopped if the titer of IgG antibodies against phase I antigens decreases by at least fourfold. The frequency of serologic monitoring during treatment is described above. (See <a href=\"#H1382850263\" class=\"local\">'Serologic response'</a> above.)</p><p>The recommendation for at least 18 months of treatment is based upon the presence of viable <em>C. burnetii</em> in tissue despite prolonged antibiotic treatment. As an example, in a study of 28 patients with Q fever endocarditis, the detection of <em>C. burnetii</em> in cardiac valves (using immunohistochemical analysis, culture, and PCR) decreased significantly only after individuals received at least one year of antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/q-fever-endocarditis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical valve replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery to replace a damaged valve in Q fever endocarditis is generally indicated for hemodynamic reasons.

Endocarditis occurs primarily in men over the age of 40, and in those who are immunocompromised, pregnant, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have underlying valvular damage. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients have a previously known valvulopathy and present with symptoms of heart failure or worsening valve dysfunction. Non-cardiac manifestations of endocarditis are also frequently noted and include splenomegaly, digital clubbing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a purpuric rash. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vegetative lesions are rarely visualized by echocardiography (either transthoracic or transesophageal). When lesions are present, they are often small, can be difficult to detect, and are often missed.

We also evaluate patients without a history of acute Q fever if they have risk-factors for <em>Coxiella burnetii </em>infection (eg, persons in contact with farm animals; individuals living downwind from farms and contaminated manure, straw, or dust; laboratory personnel working with <em>C. burnetii</em>; abattoir workers) <strong>and </strong>present with a syndrome consistent with endocarditis. (See <a href=\"#H484243965\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We diagnose Q fever endocarditis in patients who fulfill certain pathologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical criteria. The principal criteria are evidence of endocarditis plus confirmation of infection with <em>C. burnetii</em>. An IgG titer &gt;800 against phase I IgG is indicative of persistent infection. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with Q fever endocarditis, we suggest treatment with the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Doxycycline is dosed as 100 mg twice daily and hydroxychloroquine is dosed as 600 mg once daily or 200 mg three times daily. Pregnant women should initiate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (160 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> and 800 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily).
