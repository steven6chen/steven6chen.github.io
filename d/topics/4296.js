The pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells required for this procedure are usually obtained from the bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood of an allogeneic (non-self) related or unrelated donor. In some situations where extensive myeloablative chemotherapy is required to treat a malignancy not involving the bone marrow, autologous (self) stem cells may be used.</p><p>Engraftment and survival rates following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are optimized when the donor and recipient are genetically compatible. The risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) correlates with the level of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity. Unfortunately, finding an HLA-matched donor is not always possible, especially for minorities. While autologous hematopoietic stem cells provide perfectly compatible tissue, this type of transplantation is not appropriate in many cases, due to the presence of the disease to be treated in the collected autologous stem cells. Each full sibling potential donor has only a 25 percent chance of being fully HLA-matched with a sibling who requires a transplant. Therefore, many patients do not have an HLA-identical relative.</p><p>When a suitable related donor is not available, a search is conducted to identify a potential unrelated HLA-matched donor. Finding an appropriate donor through a national registry is a lengthy process that is not always successful, especially for individuals who are not of Northern European descent. As a result, many patients who might benefit from HCT are not afforded this opportunity, or die during the extended process of securing a donor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Unrelated donors'</a>.)</p><p>Because of the lack of matched related donors and the risk of severe GVHD that accompanies mismatched unrelated bone marrow or peripheral blood HCT, alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells have been sought. Umbilical cord blood, the blood remaining in the umbilical cord and placenta following the birth of an infant, has emerged as a potential alternative source of hematopoietic stem cells in allogeneic HCT. Collection, storage, and ethical issues regarding the use of cord blood for HCT will be discussed here. Other issues related to umbilical cord blood transplantation are discussed separately, including the advantages and limitations to cord blood as a stem cell source and the administration of cord blood transplantation in adults using myeloablative and non-myeloablative preparative regimens.

Limitations to umbilical cord blood include an increased risk of graft failure, delayed immune reconstitution, limited stem cell number, and unavailability of the donor for additional donations (ie, donor lymphocyte infusions). This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H61604479\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of an umbilical cord blood graft for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Advantages and limitations of cord blood'</a>.)</p><p>Cord blood units that are privately banked for potential autologous use have only a remote chance of being used for the intended purpose. A very low percentage of umbilical cord blood units that are collected and stored privately are used for the child or a family member. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Estimating need for cord blood'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CORD BLOOD BANKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two main types of cord blood banks exist for the purpose of storing cord blood for potential future transplantation: public cord banks and private cord banks. It is estimated that several hundred thousand cord blood units are stored in such banks worldwide (<a href=\"http://www.bmdw.org/&amp;token=wfx3kcWyrg6bNgWPt4iiM4uzARzkfgtzAXitMNlWykw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3531\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.bmdw.org</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition to these two main types of cord blood banks, some private and public cord blood banks provide a service called directed cord blood banking in which cord blood is reserved for a sibling or family member with a known potentially transplant-treatable disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Public cord blood banks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Public cord blood banks collect and store cord blood units for use by any individual who has a medical indication for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and for whom a suitably matched unit is available. These banks perform collections at a limited number of hospitals throughout the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>], meaning that a mother can choose to donate her infant's cord blood to a public cord blood bank only if the infant is delivered at a hospital with access to such a bank. California, Connecticut, and a number of other states have developed more disseminated collection programs. More recently, programs have been developed that allow for the remote site collection of cord blood units with shipment to centralized banking facilities, thereby providing additional options for families to donate cord blood. Following collection, each cord blood unit is characterized, and the parameters (eg, HLA profile, total nucleated cell count) are placed in a public database accessible to health care providers. Public cord blood banks are usually non-profit, although a few for-profit cord blood banks bank both privately and publically. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Processing and preservation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Private cord blood banks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Private cord blood banks are for-profit enterprises that facilitate the collection of cord blood for families who are willing and able to pay for such a service [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Typically, families decide to bank their infant's cord blood so that it might serve as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for the child or another member of the family should the need arise. Private cord blood banks supply the family with a collection kit, and then generally depend on the mother's obstetrician or midwife to collect the umbilical cord blood upon delivery and transport it to the company's stem cell processing laboratory. The cord blood unit is reserved for use by the family, which pays a fee for the initial collection and processing and then annually for the continued storage of their child's cord blood unit. However, given the lack of experience or interest on the part of those collecting the cord blood, the collection volume may be inadequate for transplantation purposes despite their subsequent storage. Information regarding the stem cell count in the collected cord blood unit is often not provided to the family.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Directed cord blood banking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to these two main types of cord blood banks, private as well as public cord blood banks provide a service called directed or sibling cord blood banking for families who currently have a child or other family member with a potentially transplant-treatable disease and who are expecting another child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A program providing such a service either facilitates or performs the cord blood collection, and then processes, characterizes, and cryopreserves the unit, which is reserved for exclusive use by the donor's family. These collection and banking services for medically indicated families, either private or public, are most often performed free of charge. (See <a href=\"#H3967635\" class=\"local\">'Additional information sources for parents'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR RECRUITMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strategies for donor recruitment and consent depend on the type of program performing the banking. For public banks, it is vital that high standards of selection are employed in order to ensure the safety and quality of the cord blood supply. To this end, many banks utilize a maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family history questionnaire similar to that conducted for blood donation in the United States. This questionnaire serves to screen potential donors and their sexual partners for risk factors for infectious diseases, inherited immunologic and hematologic diseases, certain genetic diseases, cancer, and other conditions that could be transmissible by blood or hematopoietic stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Staging procedures for obtaining consent in public banks are under consideration to eliminate the time and cost of obtaining consent on cord blood units that have an insufficient volume to bank. In these procedures, the first step is to obtain approval for collection. The second step, which includes the complete medical history and laboratory screening, is done only on the 30 to 50 percent of units that have sufficient volume to bank.</p><p>In addition to historical medical information, maternal blood testing is performed to screen for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV-1 and -2, HIV p24, cytomegalovirus, syphilis, and in some programs human T-lymphotropic virus <span class=\"nowrap\">(HTLV)-I/II,</span> malaria, Chagas disease, and West Nile virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Finally, upon delivery of the infant, the mother's and neonate's hospital charts are reviewed for signs or symptoms of congenitally acquired infection and for labor and delivery factors that could put the infant donor, and thus the collected stem cell product, at risk for infection.</p><p>For private banks, and for those medically indicated sibling directed donations, in which cord blood is reserved for use by the family alone, a unit may be banked regardless of the results of the maternal history, serologies, and infant evaluation. In this case, if the unit is requested for release, the transplant center makes a determination regarding the safety and adequacy of the unit for transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal (donor) consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During their pregnancies, many expectant parents become aware of the possibility of banking their infant's cord blood for potential future use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. They are encouraged to call upon their health care providers to help them decide whether or not to donate their infant's cord blood, or to pay to preserve it for private use. If the infant will be delivered at a hospital providing philanthropic donation to a public, non-profit cord blood bank at no cost to the family, such donation is encouraged. Donation is also encouraged for full siblings of a child with a potentially transplantable illness.</p><p>The parents, however, may want to consider the following privacy issues associated with public banking:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How will infectious and genetic disease testing results be conveyed to the donor's family?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What measures does the bank take to protect donor confidentiality?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the quality of the collected cord blood?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How is the unit collected and stored?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many units have been released for transplantation and what has been the outcome of the transplantation?</p><p/><p>The process of obtaining informed consent from donors differs among banks. Private banks utilize a standard consent process that is completed during the prenatal period. Public banks, on the other hand, employ a variety of consent procedures in order to optimize expense and logistic variables. Some seek consent for cord blood donation during prenatal care; others utilize a phased consent process, in which mothers are preliminarily consented during labor, the cord blood is collected following delivery of the placenta, and complete signed consent is obtained after collection. In some hospitals, the placenta and umbilical cord are considered discarded material allowing for the collection of cord blood following delivery of the placenta with consent obtained only after successful collection is performed. Each of these consent protocols has financial and ethical ramifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In all cases, the bank has the legal and ethical responsibility to provide adequate information to the mother so that she can make an informed, appropriate decision. Consent information should be provided in the mother's preferred language. At a minimum, the consent process for public banks should review the maternal testing required, the altruistic nature of the donation, and the potential laboratory or research use of samples that are not suitable for clinical use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=informed-procedural-consent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Informed procedural consent&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CORD BLOOD COLLECTION AND PROCESSING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61610752\"><span class=\"h2\">Cord blood collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protocols for umbilical cord blood collection are designed to avoid interfering with the delivery of the baby, while still preserving the sterility and maximizing the volume, and thus the number of hematopoietic stem cells collected in the cord blood unit. Importantly, cord blood collection should <strong>never</strong> compromise the safety of the mother or infant during childbirth. Standard obstetric procedures for determining the mode of delivery and timing of cord clamping should not be altered in an attempt to optimize cord blood collection. Delayed cord clamping improves infant iron stores, but compromises the size and cell dose of collected cord blood units. As such, delayed cord clamping is usually avoided in term infants when collection of cord blood is planned.</p><p>Collection may be performed either prior to (&quot;in utero&quot;) or following (&quot;ex utero&quot;) delivery of the placenta. An example of each type of collection procedure is described below. Ex utero collection is preferred because it is technically easier and safer for the clinician obtaining the sample, without compromising sample volume or sterility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Regardless of the technique employed, the earlier the blood is collected, the less likely it is that clotting will occur and the greater the chance of obtaining a maximal volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Of importance, especially in the anemic or hypovolemic newborn, immediate cord clamping reduces the volume of placental blood transfused to the infant, which can have deleterious effects (eg, low blood volume and worsening anemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Importance of unit volume'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of normal labor and delivery&quot;, section on 'Cord clamping'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>In utero collection</strong> &ndash; For &quot;in utero&quot; collection, the obstetrician or midwife receives the collection supplies in the form of a kit weeks before delivery. The kit is opened and the contents are surveyed in order to confirm that they are complete. Following delivery of the infant, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut in the usual manner. Prior to delivery of the placenta, a four- to eight-inch area of the cord is cleansed with an antiseptic solution provided in the kit. A 16 gauge needle, connected to a cord blood collection bag containing an anticoagulant solution, is inserted into the umbilical vein at the cleansed site, and the blood is allowed to drain into the bag by gravity. In utero collection can be performed by the obstetrician in the course of vaginal delivery or cesarean section.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ex utero collection</strong> &ndash; For &quot;ex utero&quot; collection, the collection supplies are kept in a room outside the delivery room. Following delivery of the placenta, it is immediately taken to the collection room, suspended from a collection stand, and the clamped umbilical cord is cleansed with antiseptic solution. A 16 gauge needle, connected to a cord blood collection bag containing an anticoagulant solution, is inserted into the umbilical vein at the cleansed site, and the blood is allowed to drain into the bag by gravity. Ex utero collection is usually performed by trained technicians.</p><p/><p>Some kits provided by for-profit companies utilize a syringe to collect the cord blood. If necessary, the needle may be repositioned, turned, or even removed and reinserted more proximal to the placenta in order to maximize the volume of blood collected. If the needle is reinserted, the new insertion site must be thoroughly cleansed prior to insertion.</p><p>With either in utero or ex utero collection, when all the residual blood has been collected, the flow stops and the cord appears empty and mostly white. This usually occurs after a minimum of two to four minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. At this point, the tube between the needle and blood bag is clamped, the needle is removed from the umbilical cord and cut from the tubing and the bag is sealed and labeled. Ideally, at least 40 to 60 mL of blood (in addition to anticoagulant) will be collected. A volume below 40 mL is unlikely to contain sufficient numbers of cells to be used for transplantation. The cord blood is stored at room temperature in order to preserve cell viability until it is shipped or otherwise transported to the processing laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A maternal blood sample is obtained within seven days of cord blood collection to screen for infections that might be transmitted to the infant and therefore might be found in the cord blood. This examination commonly includes testing for maternal HLA type, HIV (antibody and polymerase chain reaction), hepatitis C, hepatitis B (surface antigen, core antigen, and polymerase chain reaction), human T-lymphotropic virus <span class=\"nowrap\">(HTLV)-I/II,</span> treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay, West Nile virus, and cytomegalovirus IgG. Some cord banks also require testing for malaria and Chagas disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This testing is restricted to publically banked cord blood units.</p><p>Some public banks also require a saliva swab from the infant in order to screen for the presence of cytomegalovirus. Some also request a follow-up examination at six months to determine such relevant factors as seroconversion, the infant's postnatal history, or existence of potentially transmittable genetic disease. These conditions might lead to discarding of the stored cord blood unit or using it for research purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of unit volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transplantation outcome is significantly affected by the number of hematopoietic stem cells present in the cord blood unit as measured by the total number of nucleated cells (TNC) or the number of CD34+ stem cells. Importantly, the collection volume roughly correlates with both the TNC and the number of CD34+ stem cells present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. It is not clear whether the collected cord blood volume, the TNC, or the number of CD34+ stem cells is significantly altered by the mode of delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H61604500\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of an umbilical cord blood graft for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Cell dose'</a>.)</p><p>Collection volumes and cell counts vary greatly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A study of 542 umbilical cord blood collections at several hundred hospitals throughout the United States found that the mean collection volume was 103 mL, including 35 mL of anticoagulant solution, with a mean of 9 x 10<sup>8</sup> nucleated cells per collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Individual public cord blood banks use different TNC cutoffs to determine whether a particular unit will be stored for clinical use. Larger units with higher TNC numbers are preferred and a cutoff of 1 x 10<sup>9</sup> TNC per unit is commonly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Various predictors of cord blood unit volume and cell count have been investigated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-25</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal and fetal characteristics &ndash; Heavier babies, larger placentas, and women with fewer previous live births had higher cell counts, while longer gestation correlated with greater TNC counts but lower CD34+ cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/20,21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal distress &ndash; One study has suggested that umbilical cord blood collected following cesarean delivery performed because of nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing increases the number of mobilized stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similarly, umbilical cord blood from newborns with meconium-stained amniotic fluid also contains higher TNC counts and CD34+ cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mode of delivery &ndash; In one study, the average volume of cord blood obtained in 29 cesarean deliveries versus 126 vaginal deliveries was 104 and 84 mL, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Since the percent of CD34+ cells was similar in the two groups, cord blood collected during cesarean deliveries had a higher absolute number of CD34+ cells per unit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical aspects of collection &ndash; In other studies, a shorter time between delivery of the infant and clamping of the umbilical cord resulted in larger collection volumes and greater cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. A shift towards more routine delayed cord blood clamping would therefore be expected to result in smaller cord blood units and lower cell counts. Leaving a longer length of umbilical cord attached to the placenta may result in the collection of larger blood volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It is unclear whether larger volumes are obtained when cord blood collection is performed prior to delivery of the placenta. Some studies report that in utero collection provided larger volumes and increased cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/13,32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,32-34</a>], while others have shown no significant difference between in utero and ex utero collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,35</a>].

The mechanism responsible for this is not known, but it is likely similar to that which explains the low neutrophil count in African-Americans compared with Caucasians.</p><p/><p>Cord blood collection should <strong>never</strong> compromise the safety of the mother or infant during childbirth. In general, ex utero collection is preferred, especially for public banking, because it is technically easier and safer for the clinician obtaining the sample, without compromising sample volume or sterility. In utero collection is often used for private collections. Standard obstetric procedures for determining the mode of delivery and timing of cord clamping should not be altered in an attempt to optimize cord blood collection. (See <a href=\"#H61610752\" class=\"local\">'Cord blood collection'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Processing and preservation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After collection, cord blood units should be tested, processed, and stored for future use, typically within 48 hours of collection. Because of the relatively unregulated nature of cord blood banking, cord blood unit characterization and processing procedures vary. In general, public cord blood banks must perform more extensive testing in order to maintain databases searchable by transplant centers. Procedures and quality standards for the safe collection, processing, testing, storage, selection, exchange, and clinical use of cord blood are provided by various organizations. New regulations developed by the US Food and Drug Administration will insure standardized procedures for cord blood safety. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Regulatory aspects'</a> below.)</p><p>Complete characterization of a cord blood unit should include the following assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unit volume and weight, total nucleated cell count with differential, as well as an assessment of the unit's hematopoietic potential (eg, CD34+ cell count or colony forming unit count) after processing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">ABO/Rh</span> blood type and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I (-A, -B) and class II (-DRB1) haplotypes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV-1 and -2, HIV p24, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and bacterial culture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin electrophoresis to screen for the presence of a hemoglobinopathy in the donated specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/8,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At public banks, mononuclear cells, plasma, and DNA from the cord blood unit may be stored in an aliquot separate from the main unit for future infectious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic disease testing.</p><p/><p>While some banks store cord blood units with little or no processing, others remove the majority of the plasma and red blood cells in order to store the units in a smaller volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/37,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39-41</a>]. In general, processed units are preferred. This is principally because cord blood samples that have not had their red cells removed require washing prior to administration to remove red cell debris and free hemoglobin that may cause significant infusion reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. While the exact cause of the infusion reactions in such cases is not known, dilution in human serum albumin-dextran 40 may play a role in these infusion reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. In addition, unprocessed cord blood units will typically contain more dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), which can result in hypersensitivity reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. When possible, a split product should be collected. After testing and processing are completed, the viability of the hematopoietic stem cells is preserved by storing each unit in either liquid or vapor-phase nitrogen.</p><p>Processing and storage can be successfully performed at remote sites. Accordingly, a network of community collection sites targeted at particular ethnic groups and serviced by a central processing and storage facility could maximize the genetic diversity of banked cord blood units in a cost-effective fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].

If an appropriate cord blood unit is located and a decision is made to proceed with transplantation, the unit is shipped to the transplant center in its cryopreserved state and thawed and infused into the recipient according to the standardized protocols.

This is likely to change with new US Food and Drug Administration requirements. Establishments that are involvement in the collection, processing, testing, storage, and distribution of unrelated donor cord blood must register with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are subject to FDA inspection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].

However, any increase in regulatory scrutiny carries financial implications for cord blood banks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Costs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Private banking fees vary greatly. Typically, companies in the United States charge families approximately $2000 for processing the initial specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In general, this fee does not include reimbursement for the collection procedure performed by the mother's obstetrician or midwife. Each company also charges a storage fee of approximately $125 per year per unit.</p><p>It is difficult to assess the per-unit cost of public cord blood banking, as the financial model of these banks is quite different from that of private banks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. It is certain, however, that the high cost of public cord blood banking raises the question of financial viability. Public banks are sometimes able to obtain compensation from cord blood transplant recipients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their insurance companies upon release of a cord blood unit, but may rely on financial support from an external source (eg, an affiliated organization or a grant from the federal government). Unfortunately, less than 50 percent of cord blood units collected publically have cell counts that are sufficient for banking.

However, a number of these issues are illustrated via the questions posed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Who owns a given cord blood unit, the child or the parents?

What should be done with a privately banked unit if the family stops paying the storage fees?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a cord blood unit is donated to a public bank, how can the privacy of the donor be protected without compromising the safety of the unit? Should a long-term link be maintained between units and donors, so that donors can alert the bank if they develop a disease that could be transmitted via the unit? Should the recipient be able to contact the donor in case additional blood cells may be needed (eg, hematopoietic stem cells, donor lymphocytes)? Alternatively, should all identifying links be destroyed, in order to preserve donor confidentiality?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How shall the conflict of interest between donation for public banking purposes and banking for autologous use be resolved? What are the ethical implications of the fact that many families are economically unable to bank their children's cord blood through a for-profit company, but do not have access to a bank that stores blood for public use?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When infectious disease (eg, HIV and other viral testing) and genetic testing is required for banking purposes, who should be informed of the results (eg, mother, father, child)?

They may call upon their health care providers to help them decide whether or not to donate their infant's cord blood, or to pay to preserve it for private use. In particular, many parents confront the question of whether to bank their infant's cord blood through a private, for-profit company. Many pediatricians relate a general lack of knowledge with regards to counselling parents about cord blood banking. Given the current uncertainties of this technology, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend that parents routinely store their infant's umbilical cord blood for future use unless there is an immediate medically indicated use for a sibling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/14,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,69</a>]. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that patients who request information on umbilical cord blood banking should be provided with &quot;balanced and accurate information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of public versus private banking&quot; and be informed that the chance that a child or family member will develop a condition that could be treated with autologous unit of umbilical cord blood is low and that the routine storage of umbilical cord blood as &lsquo;biologic insurance&rsquo; against future disease is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Parents should be warned that autologous cord blood will not be selected if the donor child develops leukemia as the cord blood will have genetic markers of leukemia. Private cord banking is not allowed in Italy and France, and other European committees (eg, European Commission's Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, World Marrow Donor Association) have indicated their concern about the ethical status of private cord banks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/5,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,66</a>].</p><p>The emotional vulnerability of parents who want to do &quot;everything possible&quot; to ensure the future welfare of their children must be recognized while helping families make this decision. The promotional literature from private for-profit companies often does not accurately convey the potential benefits and limitations of cord blood banking and transplantation. Most of the reported cases of successful cord blood transplants utilizing cord bloods banked in private banks, as indicated on websites and not in peer reviewed publications, have been when a sibling is transplanted with the banked cord blood.</p><p>Parents considering private cord blood banking should be informed of the following issues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications for cord blood transplant are limited to certain genetic, hematologic, and malignant disorders.

However, at the present time, the data from these studies are extremely preliminary and do not support a recommendation for private cord blood banking.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-an-umbilical-cord-blood-graft-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H61604472\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of an umbilical cord blood graft for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Demand for cord blood'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two main types of cord blood banks exist for the purpose of storing cord blood for potential future transplantation: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Public cord blood banks collect and store cord blood units for use by any individual who has a medical indication for HCT and for whom a suitably matched unit is available. These banks perform collections at a limited number of hospitals throughout the world, meaning that a mother can choose to donate her infant's cord blood to a public cord blood bank if the infant is delivered at a hospital associated with such a bank. Several of these banks also have outreach programs supporting public cord blood donation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Public cord blood banks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Private cord blood banks are for-profit enterprises that facilitate the collection of cord blood for families who are willing and able to pay for such a service. Typically, families decide to bank their infant's cord blood so that it might serve as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for the child or another member of the family should the need arise. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Private cord blood banks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of public and private cord blood banks provide a service, called directed cord blood banking, for families who presently have a child or other family member with a potentially transplant-treatable disease and who are expecting another child. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Directed cord blood banking'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cord blood collection should <strong>never</strong> compromise the safety of the mother or infant during childbirth. Standard obstetric procedures for determining the mode of delivery and timing of cord clamping should <strong>not</strong> be altered in an attempt to optimize cord blood collection. While collection may be performed either prior to (&quot;in utero&quot;) or following (&quot;ex utero&quot;) delivery of the placenta, ex utero collection is generally preferred because it is technically easier and safer for the clinician obtaining the sample, without compromising sample volume or sterility. (See <a href=\"#H61610752\" class=\"local\">'Cord blood collection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After collection, cord blood units should be tested, processed, and stored for future use within 48 hours of collection. Because regulations regarding cord blood banking are relatively new, cord blood unit characterization and processing procedures still vary. A maternal blood sample should be obtained within seven days of cord blood collection to screen for infections that might be transmitted to the infant and therefore might be found in the cord blood. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Processing and preservation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents considering private cord blood banking should be informed of the following issues (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Counseling expectant parents'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The indications for cord blood transplant are currently limited to certain genetic, hematologic, and malignant disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Routine storage of umbilical cord blood as &quot;biologic insurance&quot; against future disease is not recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cord blood banked by families is much more likely to be used by the donors' siblings than by the donors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Private storage of umbilical cord blood should be considered if there is a family member with a current or probable future need for transplantation.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Barker JN, Wagner JE.
