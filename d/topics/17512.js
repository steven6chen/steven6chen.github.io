While transvaginal synthetic mesh slings have become the standard of care for surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence, concerns have been raised about the safety of synthetic mesh in treating POP. When treating POP, the durability of surgical repair with synthetic mesh must be balanced against the risk of mesh-related complications.</p><p>This topic will discuss issues related to transvaginal mesh for surgical treatment of POP.

Nonabsorbable synthetic materials are generally described by type, a classification based on pore size and weave [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Type 1 macroporous monofilament polypropylene mesh is typically preferred for reconstructive pelvic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In a meta-analysis of three trials that compared native tissue repair with a variety of mesh kits for surgical prolapse repair, of the women who received a mesh kit, 18 percent had a mesh exposure and 9 percent underwent surgical correction of mesh exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The total reoperation rate was three times greater for women with mesh kits than women with native tissue repair (relative risk [RR] 3.1, 95% CI 1.3-7.3). While the prolapse recurrence rate on examination was higher for the native tissue group than the mesh group (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.1), there was no difference in patient perception of prolapse between the groups (RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.6-1.7). Thus, the women receiving mesh kits had higher complication rates but similar outcomes from the patients&rsquo; assessments. Challenges to definitive conclusions based on the body of evidence include a limited duration of follow-up and limited data on nonsurgical patient outcomes (ie, a woman may have a recurrent bulge but not elect repeat surgical repair).</p><p>Mesh kits involve insertion of precut graft material between the vaginal epithelium and underlying fascia. However, this approach results in split-thickness of the overlying vaginal tissue, which may contribute to mesh erosion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-complications-and-risk-factors#H1362158104\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transvaginal synthetic mesh: Complications and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Surgical technique'</a>.)</p><p>The graft is suspended in a tension-free manner with polypropylene mesh arms that are typically passed through a supportive connective tissue structure (eg, arcus tendineus fascia, obturator membrane, iliococcygeus fascia, or sacrospinous ligaments) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F85544\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85544 \">figure 1</a>). Transvaginal mesh kits are available in different versions that treat one or multiple anatomic sites within the same procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103235343\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not use allograft or xenograft slings in our practice for POP treatment. They do not appear to mitigate complications and have mostly underperformed compared with synthetic materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Other types of reconstructive materials (autograft, allograft, xenograft) are reviewed elsewhere.

The optimal combination is not known; therefore, the surgical approach is tailored to the individual. We take the following approaches:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a typical risk of recurrent prolapse and who are undergoing a primary repair, we perform transvaginal prolapse repair using native tissue. We counsel women that, while native tissue repairs are associated with higher rates of recurrent prolapse and repeat prolapse surgery, the overall risk for repeat surgery is lower because women with native tissue repairs will not have synthetic mesh complications, such as mesh exposure, requiring reoperation. We believe the body of evidence, exemplified by the studies below, favor limiting the use of mesh-based primary repairs outside of clinical trials. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-management#H21524727\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In an observational study from a New York state database including over 41,000 women that compared the rates of clinically significant mesh complications and repeat surgery to treat mesh-related complications within 12 months of the original surgery, vaginal mesh repairs had higher rates of mesh erosion and repeat surgery compared with nonmesh vaginal repairs, regardless of concomitant sling surgery for stress urinary incontinence (SUI; percentages of women having repeat surgery were 5.6 percent for vaginal mesh plus sling, 4.3 percent for vaginal mesh alone, 3.8 percent for nonmesh prolapse repair with sling, and 2.5 percent for sling alone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Strengths of the study included the large number of women, use of a state-wide database (which helps capture women who change providers), and use of repeat surgery as an end point (and thus focuses on erosions that require intervention and not asymptomatic mesh exposures). Of note, women with a history of prior POP or SUI surgery were excluded from this study. Importantly, this study also reconfirmed the relative safety of synthetic mesh suburethral slings for urinary incontinence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A European trial including over 1300 women reported that mesh-augmented repairs for POP were associated with a greater than 1 in 10 risk of mesh-related complications but demonstrated no improvement in outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who have increased risk of recurrent prolapse (eg, women with procidentia or with a known connective tissue abnormality) or who have failed a primary repair, we offer synthetic mesh surgical repair because synthetic mesh repair is associated with lower rates of recurrent prolapse and repeat prolapse surgery compared with native tissue repair. We also counsel these women that the risk of mesh-related complications and overall repeat surgery rates for mesh-related complications are higher with synthetic mesh repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Our approach is based on evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing transvaginal mesh or grafts with native tissue repair for vaginal prolapse that reported the following outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the analysis of 21 trials comparing synthetic transvaginal mesh with native tissue repair for POP, the risk of recurrent prolapse, defined as stage 2 or greater prolapse on examination at any vaginal site, was lower in women undergoing synthetic mesh repairs than for native tissue repairs (relative risk [RR] 0.40, 95% CI 0.30-0.53, n = 2494 women). When the subanalysis was limited to women with anterior compartment repair, synthetic mesh repairs were associated with an even lower risk of recurrent prolapse compared with native tissue repairs (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.26-0.40, 15 trials, n = 1748 women).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the analysis of 12 trials assessing repeat prolapse surgery, repeat surgery for any prolapse was less common in women undergoing synthetic mesh repairs than for native tissue repairs (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31-0.88, n = 1675 women).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the analysis of seven trials assessing the combined rates of repeat surgery (ie, repeat surgery for prolapse, urinary incontinence, or mesh exposure), women with synthetic mesh repairs had more than double the risk of repeat surgery compared with women with native tissue repairs (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.51-3.81, n = 867) because of the increase in mesh-related complications that required surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One major limitation of the studies in the above meta-analysis is their relatively short period of follow-up. Data are needed comparing the long-term cumulative risk of surgery for mesh-related complications with the risk of repeat surgery for recurrent prolapse after a native tissue repair. It is possible that the risks will cross at some future time point. It is also important to note that a number of the trials included in the above meta-analysis did not allow for concomitant apical repair in the native tissue arm; hence it remains unclear if, and by how much, this omission contributed to the above findings. Lastly, the studies did not include information on surgeon volume. As with other gynecologic surgeries, it is possible that surgeon volume will impact complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prolapse repair with synthetic mesh can be performed via transabdominal or transvaginal routes. The choice of route partly depends on the anatomic defects that are present. For women with apical prolapse, we prefer abdominal repair (open, traditional laparoscopic, or robot-assisted prolapse repair). Discussion of the benefits and risks of abdominal and vaginal repair is presented elsewhere.

In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration reclassified surgical mesh for <strong>transvaginal</strong> POP repair as a class III (ie, high risk) device and required manufacturers to submit premarket approval applications to support the safety and effectiveness of synthetic mesh use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This change in classification was based upon the increase in reported adverse events from mesh-based transvaginal POP repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This modification did not apply to transvaginal mesh used in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence or to transabdominal mesh for prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The FDA also ordered 522 postmarket surveillance studies to further assess risk of transvaginal mesh; results of these studies are not yet available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2017 draft recommendations went a step further and stated that transvaginal mesh for the surgical treatment of POP should only be performed in the context of research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>A subsequent review of the original FDA approval process for 61 mesh POP devices reported approval for all was based on claimed equivalence to the 1985 Mersilene Mesh (Ethicon) and the 1996 ProteGen Sling (Boston Scientific) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. No clinical trial data was available at the time of the approval of the 61 devices. Published trial data was reported a median of 5 years after device approval (range 1 to 14 years). Since the request for the 522 postmarket surveillance studies, 79 manufacturers (66 percent) have stopped device distribution and 26 (22 percent) have changed the device indication. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15375039\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations to health care providers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regulatory agencies around the globe have released recommendations on the use of synthetic mesh in treating POP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/1,20-25,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20-25,30</a>].

The utility of antibiotic prophylaxis is based upon indirect data from other procedures involving mesh. Mesh use in inguinal or femoral hernia repair is the most similar clinical use. A meta-analysis of six randomized trials in which reconstructive material was used for inguinal hernia repair demonstrated that infection rates were significantly lower when antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transvaginal-synthetic-mesh-use-in-pelvic-organ-prolapse-pop/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

A vaginal incision is classified as a clean-contaminated procedure, which is associated with a 2.4 to 7.7 percent rate of surgical site infection, and antibiotic prophylaxis is typically used for this risk of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H3142409\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Wound classification'</a>.)</p><p>Use of reconstructive materials does not affect the need for antibiotic prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis.

Materials with microporous structure are associated with increased complications rates and should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H103235368\" class=\"local\">'Synthetic mesh'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Biologic materials (xenograft and allografts) are less commonly used because they are less effective for treatment of POP compared with synthetic materials yet have comparable rates of complications. (See <a href=\"#H103235343\" class=\"local\">'Biologic materials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Commercial transvaginal mesh kits for POP (referred to as mesh kits or trocar-guided mesh kits) are rarely used because of high complication rates. (See <a href=\"#H314234\" class=\"local\">'Transvaginal mesh kits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of synthetic mesh or native tissue in gynecologic surgery varies by procedure indication and surgical approach. (See <a href=\"#H2852365385\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with a typical risk of recurrent prolapse who are undergoing primary transvaginal POP repair, we suggest native tissue reconstruction rather than synthetic mesh repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Although native tissue repairs are associated with higher rates of recurrent prolapse on examination and repeat prolapse surgery compared with synthetic mesh repairs, native tissue surgery does not have synthetic mesh complications and thus has lower overall reoperation rates. (See <a href=\"#H2852365385\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who have failed prior reconstructive surgery or have high future risk of prolapse, we suggest synthetic mesh repair rather than native tissue repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We offer abdominal or robot-assisted prolapse repair (eg, sacrocolpopexy) with synthetic mesh because synthetic mesh repairs are associated with lower rates of recurrent prolapse and repeat prolapse surgery. We believe the risks of mesh-related complications and increased overall repeat surgery rates are acceptable for select women after appropriate counseling. (See <a href=\"#H2852365385\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regulatory agencies have issued statements regarding use of synthetic mesh in gynecologic surgery and made recommendations for health care providers on training, mesh use, patient counseling, and postoperative follow-up.

The informed consent includes information regarding (1) benefit and risk of complications with mesh use, (2) permanence of polypropylene mesh, (3) alternative nonsurgical options and other surgical treatments, and (4) potential complications of synthetic mesh, which may require additional intervention and may not completely resolve with mesh removal.
