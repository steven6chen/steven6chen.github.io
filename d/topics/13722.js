The widespread use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a decline in the incidence of glandular infiltration by opportunistic infections and neoplasms and has generated increased attention toward the metabolic complications of HIV therapy, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and alterations in body fat distribution.</p><p>This topic review will address the assessment and management of pituitary and adrenal disorders in HIV-infected patients. Issues related to HIV lipodystrophy including metabolic syndrome, bone and calcium disorders, and thyroid dysfunction in this population are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of HIV-associated lipodystrophy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-and-calcium-disorders-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone and calcium disorders in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-gland-dysfunction-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid gland dysfunction in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the diagnosis and treatment of a specific endocrinopathy in a patient with HIV infection does not differ from that in an immunocompetent individual. There are, however, some special considerations. HIV infection may cause changes in pituitary and adrenal function that are adaptive and do not require treatment. Furthermore, many of the signs and symptoms of pituitary and adrenal dysfunction are nonspecific and can overlap with other non-endocrine disorders that are common in HIV-infected patients. Finally, many medications that are used to treat HIV infection and its complications can induce endocrine dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83250\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83250 \">table 1</a>), including affecting pituitary and adrenal hormones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND CANCERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the era of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), infections and malignancies (ie, Kaposi sarcoma and lymphoma) in the adrenal and pituitary glands are rare in HIV-infected patients though they may be observed in patients not receiving ART and those with antiretroviral drug-resistant infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72716 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Tissue is generally required for a definitive diagnosis. When technically feasible, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the adrenal gland provides a less invasive alternative to open biopsy. Pheochromocytoma must always be excluded before FNA biopsy of the adrenal gland is performed. Standard functional testing should also be performed since clinically significant endocrine dysfunction may accompany glandular infection or infiltration of the pituitary or adrenal glands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PITUITARY GLAND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pituitary gland secretes and releases hormones that directly affect the functions of the thyroid gland, the adrenal gland, and the gonads as well as influencing growth, milk production, and water balance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothalamic-pituitary-axis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothalamic-pituitary axis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The specific effects of HIV infection on pituitary function are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Alterations in pituitary function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior pituitary functional reserve is usually maintained, as evidenced by studies administering hypothalamic releasing hormones (ie, gonadotropin-, thyrotropin-, and corticotrophin-releasing hormones) to HIV-infected patients at various stages of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Post-stimulation peak levels of growth hormone (GH), prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) may even be modestly increased, suggesting enhanced pituitary responsiveness due to subclinical target organ dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Despite the normal response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which excludes significant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or luteinizing hormone (LH) deficiency, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is commonly observed in patients with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] as a consequence of hypothalamic dysfunction. This abnormality is likely due to a variety of factors, including the presence of chronic systemic illness, which suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.</p><p>Published reports have demonstrated conflicting results as to whether or not prolactin levels are increased compared with HIV-seronegative controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-9</a>]. In a large study of 192 clinically stable HIV-infected men, 21 percent were found to have hyperprolactinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although there was no HIV-seronegative control group in this study, this prevalence is greater than would be expected in the general population. The cause for elevations in prolactin is unknown but is hypothesized to be related to immunologic dysregulation. Other researchers have suggested that these higher serum prolactin levels are due to increases in macroprolactin, a glycosylated isoform of prolactin that is not biologically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the anterior pituitary gland, posterior pituitary function is often abnormal in patients with AIDS. In a study of 103 hospitalized AIDS patients, 36 were found to have serum sodium less than 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Hyponatremia was attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion (SIADH) in 23 subjects. There was no definitive evidence, however, of a primary pituitary disorder since there were other confounding factors, including pulmonary infection (most notably <em>Pneumocystis </em>pneumonia) and treatment with medications known to affect fluid and electrolyte metabolism (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a>).

Exogenous glucocorticoids, given by any route, should be used with caution and careful monitoring among patients using protease inhibitors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1041013389\"><span class=\"h3\">Other medications used in HIV-infected patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adrenocortical function can be altered by other medications used in the treatment of HIV infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ketoconazole</a> inhibits adrenal steroidogenesis and can lead to glucocorticoid deficiency in patients with impaired adrenal reserve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> can lower circulating cortisol levels through enhanced clearance of cortisol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Megestrol acetate</a>, a synthetic progestin with intrinsic glucocorticoid-like activity, can suppress both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axes when administered chronically for appetite stimulation.

A post-stimulation peak cortisol level greater than 18 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> generally excludes adrenal insufficiency. Clinicians should note that since the standard stimulation test employs a supraphysiologic dose of ACTH, it is not sensitive in patients with partial or acute pituitary dysfunction. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia or the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> test are sometimes necessary to confirm the diagnosis of suspected secondary adrenal insufficiency in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], although these tests are challenging to perform in routine clinical practice. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Assessment of clinically significant adrenal insufficiency in patients with HIV can be further complicated by hypoalbuminemia since total cortisol levels are typically measured. In a study of 66 critically ill patients, the 36 patients with albumin &lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and subnormal ACTH-stimulated total cortisol concentrations were subsequently found to have normal adrenal function and elevated free cortisol concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>With the above caveats, a standard ACTH test should be performed initially. If this test is normal, but adrenal insufficiency is still suspected, we recommend consultation with an endocrinologist.</p><p>If adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, a baseline ACTH level is useful to distinguish between a primary and secondary etiology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high ACTH level indicates primary adrenal insufficiency, which in an HIV-infected patient is most often due to an infiltrative process of the adrenal glands, such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or cytomegalovirus adrenalitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low or normal ACTH level usually implies central adrenal insufficiency. In the latter group, without a known exposure to an exogenous agent that can suppress the HPA axis (eg, glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a>), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the pituitary should be obtained to exclude an anatomic abnormality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The approach to the treatment of the HIV-infected patient with glucocorticoid insufficiency is the same as in the HIV-seronegative patient. Glucocorticoid replacement therapy should be initiated using the lowest possible doses (typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> that relieve clinical symptoms. Patients with documented adrenal insufficiency require higher doses of glucocorticoids during periods of stress, such as acute illness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery. The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a> may be necessary in the setting of primary adrenal failure with concomitant mineralocorticoid deficiency (usually manifested biochemically by hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis).</p><p>It is not clear whether patients who have elevated basal cortisol levels with a blunted response to standard ACTH stimulation testing require replacement therapy, since some will respond to prolonged (72-hour) ACTH infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These challenging cases must be evaluated individually, taking into account the potential benefits on clinical symptoms and the risks of adverse effects. Some practitioners advocate treating these patients with glucocorticoids only during periods of stress, limiting steroid exposure as much as possible.

In the era of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), there has been a decline in opportunistic infections and malignancies but an increased incidence of metabolic complications, some related to medications. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, the diagnosis and treatment of pituitary and adrenal disorders in a patient with HIV infection does not differ from that in an immunocompetent individual. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior pituitary functional reserve is usually maintained, whereas posterior pituitary function may be abnormal in a patient with AIDS. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Alterations in pituitary function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The somatotropic axis is influenced by nutritional status and body composition, leading to characteristic abnormalities in patients with AIDS wasting and HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'The somatotropic axis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the prevalence of glucocorticoid deficiency appears to be greater than in the general population, clinically significant adrenal insufficiency is rare but should be considered in the patient with AIDS, hypotension, and critical illness. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Alterations in adrenal function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels and elevated cortisol to DHEA ratios are found in HIV infection, particularly in the setting of body composition changes due to either lipodystrophy or malnutrition. We suggest <strong>not</strong> routinely using DHEA replacement therapy in this setting (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The available clinical trials of DHEA replacement therapy in HIV-infected patients are limited, and the efficacy and safety of this therapy remain unproven. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Dehydroepiandrosterone replacement therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medications can lead to cortisol insufficiency or excess. Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome can result from the coadministration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a> and nasal or inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a>, whereas medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> can lower circulating cortisol levels through enhanced clearance of cortisol. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Antiretroviral drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A standard adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test should be ordered as the initial approach for evaluation of adrenal function. If adrenal insufficiency is confirmed, an ACTH level should be drawn to help differentiate between primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and treatment of adrenal dysfunction'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pituitary-and-adrenal-gland-dysfunction-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dobs AS, Dempsey MA, Ladenson PW, Polk BF.
