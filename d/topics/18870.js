An overview of specific forms of SCID and a general overview of SCID are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-specific-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): Specific defects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17674562\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a cohort of 42 severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) infants diagnosed prospectively by newborn screening in the US, nine (21 percent) had X-linked SCID (SCIDX1 or X-SCID, MIM 300400) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. X-SCID is a smaller proportion of SCID in regions of the world where parental consanguinity is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) is caused by defects in a gene on the X chromosome encoding the cytokine receptor subunit gamma-c (the interleukin receptor common gamma chain [IL2RG]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This receptor subunit is shared by at least six different cytokine receptor complexes: the receptors for interleukins-2, -4, -7, -9, -15, and -21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Mutations in this gene lead to profound derangement of the immune system via the blockade of multiple cytokine pathways important for lymphocyte development and function.</p><p>The gamma-c subunit is also involved in growth hormone receptor signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, growth failure seen in children with X-SCID may be due to both the underlying genetic defect and to recurrent infections and nutritional deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This could explain why many patients continue to have growth failure with severe short stature after partial correction of the defect with hematopoietic cell transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17674605\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These male patients usually have the classic clinical severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) phenotype, presenting in the newborn period with recurrent severe infections, chronic diarrhea, and failure to thrive. However, some patients have an atypical presentation, such as an Omenn syndrome phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] or a polymorphous lymphoproliferative disorder with Hodgkin-like features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics#H3809878233\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T-B-NK+ SCID: Pathogenesis and genetics&quot;, section on 'Omenn syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the large majority of patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID), peripheral T cells are absent or very low (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL),</span> and the absent or small thymus is devoid of lymphocytes and is not visualized on a posterior-anterior chest radiograph. However, there are reported cases of X-SCID in which subpopulations of T cells have somatic reversion of the interleukin-2 receptor gamma (IL2RG) mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. This somatic mosaicism results in variant phenotypic expression, including attenuated disease in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Natural killer (NK) cells are usually also severely reduced in numbers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow cytometry for the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Immunoglobulin is virtually nonexistent, except for transplacental immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the first months of life, despite the presence of normal numbers of B cells. This is largely due to the absence of T cell help for antibody production. However, autologous B cells are not normal, since they have at least six abnormal cytokine receptors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) is likely in males with SCID and normal or elevated numbers of B cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69679\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69679 \">table 1</a>). However, X-SCID must be differentiated from autosomal recessive Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) deficiency, which is clinically and immunologically indistinguishable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-with-jak3-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with JAK3 deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A functional signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) tyrosine phosphorylation assay can be used to rapidly distinguish X-SCID and JAK-3 SCID from other forms of SCID. The presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT5, detected by flow cytometry after interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulation, indicates a functional <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-2/JAK-3</span> signal transduction pathway; its absence indicates a defect in this pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The assay accurately predicted IL-2 receptor gamma (IL2RG) and JAK-3 mutations in 94 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(16/17)</span> of patients. Mutations in these genes were not found in one patient with negative pSTAT5.</p><p>The diagnosis of X-SCID may be definitively established by demonstrating the absence of the common gamma chain on lymphocyte surfaces by flow cytometry. However, in many cases, a nonfunctional gamma-c may be surface expressed. The diagnosis of X-SCID may also be established by a skewed pattern of X-chromosome inactivation in maternal T cells, but this pattern cannot detect the 30 percent of cases resulting from new mutations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In rare cases, the only way to make the diagnosis is by mutation analysis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a>). As an example, many features of the SCID phenotype were absent in three patients with an X-linked mutation in the common gamma chain that resulted in normal numbers of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells and antibody levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These children had normal-appearing thymus glands and peripheral lymphoid tissue but suffered severe infections during the first year of life. Specific antibody response was severely impaired, and their lymphocytes failed to respond to IL-2 in vitro, suggesting a defect in IL-2 receptor expression or signaling. A single amino acid substitution was identified in the extracellular portion of the gamma-c. The pathophysiologic basis for the remarkably normal laboratory phenotype of such patients has not been elucidated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary therapy available for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) is hematopoietic cell transplantation. For full function to be restored, both T and B cell engraftment must occur. If only donor T cells engraft, abnormal host B cells are still unable to make antibody, and patients usually need to receive immunoglobulin G (IgG) replacement in this circumstance. The possible role of gene therapy continues to evolve, with evidence of effectiveness demonstrated, but concerns about insertional oncogenesis remaining.
