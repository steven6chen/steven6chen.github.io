It is also known as &quot;sweat rash,&quot; &quot;prickly heat,&quot; or &quot;heat rash.&quot; There are three main types of miliaria &ndash; crystallina, rubra, and profunda &ndash; which are distinguished by clinical appearance as well as histologic findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102826%7EDERM%2F76069%7EDERM%2F102847%7EDERM%2F102849\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102826 graphicRef76069 graphicRef102847 graphicRef102849 \">picture 1A-D</a>). The type of miliaria that develops depends upon the level at which the duct is blocked.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of miliaria will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444596713\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Miliaria occurs most commonly under conditions of sweating. It is found in both children and adults. All types are found in all races. Miliaria occurs in both sexes, though in some studies men were more commonly affected due to outdoor activities or occupations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria crystallina</strong>, also known as sudamina, is very common in neonates. Incidence peaks at approximately one week of age. Reports of frequency range from 4.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] to 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It has also been reported in adults. Congenital miliaria crystallina has been described.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria rubra</strong> is the most common type. It has been reported in 4 percent of neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and in up to 30 percent of people of all ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria profunda</strong>, also known as tropical anhidrosis or mamillaria, is rare. It is most common in adult males, especially military personnel stationed in tropical climates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Subclinical miliaria has been postulated to be an initial step in the development of atopic dermatitis; however, this is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444596719\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occlusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammation of the eccrine sweat duct are the cause of all types of miliaria. Overhydration of the corneocytes is thought to cause them to swell and block the duct. Skin cells and other debris can also block the duct. Deeper involvement of the duct and gland can cause inflammation and rupture.</p><p>Neonates are particularly susceptible, mainly to miliaria crystallina and miliaria rubra. This has been postulated to be due to underdevelopment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed patency of the eccrine sweat duct after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Anything that causes sweating can lead to miliaria in infants, children, and adults. Common causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hot and humid environments</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Strenuous physical activity</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Febrile illness</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Occlusion of the skin</strong></p><p/><p>Hot and humid environments are particularly common causes, especially soon after moving to a tropical climate. The condition usually resolves with acclimatization. Occlusion of the skin with non-porous clothing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] or bandage wrappings may cause miliaria, as may transdermal medication patches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Other associations have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medications </strong>&ndash; Miliaria crystallina has occurred with medications that affect follicular epithelia, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Sweating is under the control of the sympathetic autonomic system, but the postsynaptic neurotransmitter is acetylcholine. Sweat has been demonstrated to be inhibited by anticholinergic agents and stimulated by cholinergic drugs. Miliaria has been reported in patients treated with alpha-sympathomimetic drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, and in patients treated with opiates, beta-blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bethanechol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bethanechol</a>, and other medications that influence the sympathetic or cholinergic systems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cutaneous diseases that disrupt the epidermis </strong>&ndash; Miliaria crystallina following staphylococcal scalded skin and Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disorders associated with increased salt in the sweat </strong>&ndash; Miliaria crystallina has occurred in patients with hypernatremia but without fever; direct desiccation of the corneocyte by excess sodium is thought to be causative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, miliaria rubra has been reported in type I pseudohypoaldosteronism, in which increased concentration of salt in the eccrine sweat has been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultraviolet or ionizing radiation </strong>&ndash; Ultraviolet exposure may disrupt the duct and has been associated with miliaria crystallina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Radiotherapy also has been reported to precipitate miliaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bacteria </strong>&ndash; Bacteria, particularly staphylococci, have been found in lesions of miliaria, and treatment with antibiotics has been helpful in prevention of experimentally induced miliaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The periodic acid-Schiff-positive material in pathologic specimens of miliaria rubra is reported to be an extracellular polysaccharide substance produced by <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

PHA type I is usually diagnosed in the neonatal period with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Cutaneous symptoms may include miliaria rubra, folliculitis, and atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444596725\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of miliaria crystallina, miliaria rubra, and miliaria profunda are reviewed below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria crystallina</strong> results from superficial blockage of the sweat duct (within the stratum corneum) and is characterized by superficial, clear 1 to 2 mm vesicles that resemble water droplets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102826%7EDERM%2F76069%7EDERM%2F102844%7EDERM%2F102845%7EDERM%2F103013\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102826 graphicRef76069 graphicRef102844 graphicRef102845 graphicRef103013 \">picture 1A-B, 1E-G</a>). The vesicles may coalesce. Due to their superficial location, the vesicles rupture easily and do not cause a significant inflammatory response. Hence, there is no surrounding erythema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The vesicles are often widely spread and are most common on the head, neck, and upper trunk of neonates and on the trunk of adults. The involved areas are generally asymptomatic. The vesicles appear in crops within days to weeks of appropriate environmental exposure and resolve within hours to days with superficial desquamation that is described as &quot;branny.&quot; Congenital cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria rubra</strong> results from blockage of the duct, usually within the epidermis, although it can occur in the dermis. Leakage of sweat causes inflammation in the periductal tissue. Miliaria rubra is characterized by erythematous 2 to 4 mm papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102847%7EDERM%2F102848%7EDERM%2F102865\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102847 graphicRef102848 graphicRef102865 \">picture 1C, 1H-I</a>). They may be papulovesicular or pustular, and background erythema is often seen. It is important to note that the papules are not follicularly based. When pustular, miliaria rubra is called <strong>miliaria pustulosa</strong>. Bacteria, particularly staphylococci, may be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In infants, miliaria rubra is most common in the skin folds of the neck, axilla, or groin. In adults, miliaria rubra is often seen in areas of friction with clothing: upper trunk (especially the back), scalp, neck, and flexural areas. The face, palms, and soles are spared. Rare cases of confluent patches similar to sunburn have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Unlike miliaria crystallina and miliaria profunda, miliaria rubra is typically associated with itching or stinging that is worsened by sweating. Anhidrosis can occur in affected areas. Miliaria rubra can become superinfected, usually with staphylococci, resulting in impetigo or multiple abscesses known as periporitis staphylogenes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria profunda</strong> is caused by blockage deeper within the sweat duct (at the dermal-epidermal junction). It usually occurs after repeated episodes of miliaria rubra. Escape of sweat into the surrounding tissues results in erythematous to skin-colored, firm papules 1 to 4 mm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102849\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102849 \">picture 1D</a>). The papules are nonfollicular.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Seen most commonly in adults, miliaria profunda usually occurs on the trunk but can be seen on the extremities as well. Because sweat is obstructed deeply within the skin, affected areas show little or no sweating. The eruption is typically asymptomatic. It may also be subtle and become more visible when the patient sweats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A rare type of miliaria profunda, &quot;giant centrifugal miliaria profunda,&quot; has been described in infants as well as a granulomatous variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p>When miliaria rubra or miliaria profunda is severe or recurrent, sweat glands may temporarily malfunction or be completely destroyed; anhidrosis in affected areas may result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This can be accompanied by compensatory hyperhidrosis in non-affected areas, particularly the face, axillae, and inguinal areas. It can also lead to inefficient thermoregulation and may be accompanied by hyperthermia, heat exhaustion, weakness, malaise, dyspnea, tachycardia, and cardiovascular collapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444596751\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histopathologic findings in miliaria reflect the depth of occlusion of the sweat duct.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria crystallina</strong> &ndash; Displays an intracorneal or subcorneal vesicle within the acrosyringium of the sweat duct; a sparse neutrophilic infiltrate may be seen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria rubra</strong> &ndash; Characterized by spongiotic vesicles in the stratum malpighii that communicate with the sweat duct; surrounding inflammation is predominantly lymphocytic within the dermis and periductal tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F103032\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103032 \">picture 2</a>). There is often a periodic acid-Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant cast within the eccrine duct. Bacteria are often observed as well. Neutrophils predominate within the sweat retention vesicle in miliaria pustulosa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria profunda</strong> &ndash; Demonstrates similar histologic findings as miliaria rubra along with rupture of the intradermal duct and significant lymphocytic infiltrates and spongiosis of the intraepidermal portion on the duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102850\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102850 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444596775\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is usually made based upon the clinical appearance in a neonate or in a patient who has a recent history of sweating. In miliaria crystallina, the physical examination should reveal multiple, superficial clear vesicles without associated inflammation. The erythematous papules, papulovesicles, or pustules of miliaria rubra should not be follicularly based, a feature that aids in distinguishing this disorder from folliculitis. The skin-colored papules of miliaria profunda also should be non-follicular.</p><p>Biopsy to confirm the diagnosis may be necessary in severe or recurrent cases. In vivo imaging studies using high-definition optical coherence tomography are able to localize the blockage of the sweat duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, this procedure is not necessary for diagnosis in the clinical setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444596781\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of miliaria includes other disorders that may present with multiple small vesicles, papules, or pustules on the skin. In general, the clinical evaluation is sufficient to distinguish miliaria from these disorders. Microbiological studies, skin biopsy, or other tests can be helpful when needed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Viral infections</strong> (herpes simplex virus or varicella (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55533 \">picture 4</a>))</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fungal infections</strong> (<em>Candida</em> or <em>Pityrosporum </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86998%7EDERM%2F86997\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86998 graphicRef86997 \">picture 5A-B</a>))</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bacterial folliculitis</strong> (especially staphylococci, <em>Pseudomonas</em>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50187\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50187 \">picture 6</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Viral exanthems </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58169\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58169 \">picture 7</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acne </strong>(including neonatal acne (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F56615\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56615 \">picture 8</a>)) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-skin-and-scalp-lesions-in-the-newborn-and-infant#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign skin and scalp lesions in the newborn and infant&quot;, section on 'Neonatal acne'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sterile folliculitis</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Erythema toxicum neonatorum </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F70785\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70785 \">picture 9</a>)<strong> </strong>(see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-skin-and-scalp-lesions-in-the-newborn-and-infant#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign skin and scalp lesions in the newborn and infant&quot;, section on 'Erythema toxicum neonatorum'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug eruptions</strong> (such as acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis [AGEP] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F56807\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56807 \">picture 10</a>)) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-generalized-exanthematous-pustulosis-agep\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arthropod assault </strong>(see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insect bites&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria-type lymphocytoma cutis</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-t-cell-pseudolymphomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous T cell pseudolymphomas&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444596790\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria crystallina</strong> is self-limiting and asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Miliaria rubra</strong> tends to resolve with removal of the cause (acclimatization, recovery from illness, removal of occlusive clothing) but can recur.

(See <a href=\"#H444596719\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miliaria can occur in children and adults. Miliaria is most commonly seen in the neonatal period and in hot environments. Miliaria can also occur in association with fever. (See <a href=\"#H444596713\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H444596719\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miliaria is divided into three types, depending on the level at which the duct is compromised:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Miliaria crystallina</strong> is the most superficial form of miliaria. Clear vesicles form at the orifices of eccrine sweat ducts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102826%7EDERM%2F76069%7EDERM%2F102844%7EDERM%2F102845%7EDERM%2F103013\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102826 graphicRef76069 graphicRef102844 graphicRef102845 graphicRef103013 \">picture 1A-B, 1E-G</a>). Miliaria crystallina is most common in neonates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Miliaria rubra</strong> is the most common form of miliaria. It is characterized by erythematous, non-follicular papules and most commonly involves the upper trunk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102847%7EDERM%2F102848%7EDERM%2F102865\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102847 graphicRef102848 graphicRef102865 \">picture 1C, 1H-I</a>). Miliaria rubra can occur at any age and may be accompanied by pruritus. Miliaria rubra may lead to damage of the eccrine gland and miliaria profunda.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Miliaria profunda</strong> is uncommon. Blockage deep within the duct causes asymptomatic, skin-colored papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102849\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102849 \">picture 1D</a>). When damage to the sweat gland from miliaria profunda or miliaria rubra is severe, anhidrosis may develop in affected areas resulting in hyperthermia and heat exhaustion. (See <a href=\"#H444596725\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of miliaria revolves around minimizing exposure to factors that stimulate sweating and occlusion of eccrine sweat glands. The following measures are recommended:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Movement of the patient to a cooler environment, if possible</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wearing of breathable clothing (such as cotton) that does not occlude the skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Removal of occlusive bandages in the affected area and use of more porous alternatives, if needed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treatment of fever with antipyretics (see <a href=\"#H444596809\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/miliaria/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hidano A, Purwoko R, Jitsukawa K.
