Nowhere else in the body is it more important to achieve good functional reconstruction matched with perfect cosmetic appearance than in the head and neck, and specifically the face.</p><p>Following resuscitation and stabilization, management of the burn wounds becomes the next priority. The later effects of burns, which are related to loss of normal tissue and scarring, include limitation of movement, pain, disfigurement, and social embarrassment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The following are the basic tenets for reconstruction of burns to the face, scalp, and neck regions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Replace like tissue with like tissue (eg, the best replacement for scalp tissue is the scalp) when possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multidisciplinary, realistic, well-timed reconstructive plan discussed with the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prioritize function over cosmesis, but combine whenever possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reconstruct areas of paramount functional importance first, specifically those surrounded by sphincters such as the mouth and lips to avoid microstomia, and the eyelids to avoid exposure keratopathy and cicatricial ectropion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consider early release and reconstruction of the neck with pliable tissue to avoid further secondary contracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respect the principle of cosmetic subunits in the face.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue expansion increases the amount of skin available for reconstruction.

Burns to the face, with the exception of a sunburn, are never considered minor as even small burns affect function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cosmesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-burn-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of burn injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111243691\"><span class=\"h1\">BURNS TO THE FACE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burns to the face are particularly challenging because of the functional impairments and aesthetic disfigurements caused by the burn. Burns to the face are best managed initially by daily gentle washes, followed by the application of a topical cytoprotective or moisturizing agent. Excessive drying or desiccation of the wound should be avoided. Dermal regeneration templates (biosynthetic skin substitutes) can be used, especially for intermediate partial-thickness wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. These issues are discussed in detail separately. Evidence for reconstruction of the face and its components is based upon observational studies and the clinical setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-procedures-used-in-the-management-of-burn-injuries#H8044936\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical procedures used in the management of burn injuries&quot;, section on 'Use of skin substitutes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care#H2088109107\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care&quot;, section on 'Dressings'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-grafting-and-skin-substitutes#H1248765685\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin grafting and skin substitutes&quot;, section on 'Skin substitutes'</a>.)</p><p>Facial transplantation procedure, a controversial reconstructive technique, offers hope to patients with severe facial burns or other deformities. Facial transplantation remains predominantly an experimental technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Restrictions to this procedure include a limited availability of fascial tissue allografts, inherent complexity of the technique, required presence of a skilled multidisciplinary surgical team, and a lifelong requirement for immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Postoperative sensory recovery is reported to occur between three and six months, and acceptable motor recovery occurs between 9 and 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a review of 28 procedures performed worldwide, episodes of acute skin rejection have been able to be controlled with conventional immunosuppressive agents with no cases of chronic rejection reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111243698\"><span class=\"h2\">Ear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The skin covering the ear frame is firmly bound to the cartilage as the ear lacks a subcutaneous layer and vascularity is dependent on the blood supply from branches of the superficial temporal, occipital, and posterior auricular arteries. Therefore, there is little protection or insulation of the cartilage from injury. Burns distort the delicate cartilage and create scars, deformities, and loss of elasticity. Reconstruction of ear burns is more difficult than other types of ear trauma. In a large retrospective review of reconstruction in 249 patients with traumatized ears, those with burned ears had worse results compared to other mechanisms of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Burns to the ear are initially managed conservatively. This includes shaving the hair around the ear, assessing the burn depth, daily cleansing, and application of a topical ointment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Topical antimicrobial ointments, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mafenide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mafenide</a> acetate, are advocated to prevent infection from converting a superficial partial-thickness to a deep partial-thickness burn. Mafenide acetate has a broad spectrum of activity and penetrates eschar. In a retrospective review of 76 patients with ear burns treated with conservative management and mafenide acetate, only two patients (2.6 percent) developed chondritis, a painful and destructive process of the cartilage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. External pressure and overzealous debridement of the ear should be avoided to minimize tissue loss. </p><p>Reconstruction of the burned ear is complex and depends mainly on the depth, not necessarily the extent, of the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Reconstruction should provide skin coverage and cartilage support if it is damaged or exposed. The following procedures are available to reconstruct the burned ear: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burns restricted to small areas of skin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cartilage loss are amenable to a primary direct closure, provided the closure will not alter the projection or shape of the ear. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial burns to the ear that do not damage or expose the cartilage are treated with topical antimicrobial ointments and dressing changes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deeper burns that expose <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> damage the cartilage are debrided to the level of healthy, unburned tissue and protected from desiccation and necrosis by coverage with vascularized tissue (eg, unburned full-thickness skin graft, temporoparietal fascial flap). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For total or near-total destruction of the ear, reconstruction can be performed as a single procedure or as staged procedures with various local flaps, such as the temporoparietal fascial flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. When unburned local or regional skin is not available for coverage, distant free flaps can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. When autologous tissue is limited, a bone-anchored prosthesis is an option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conchal cartilage may be used for small defects, and autologous costal cartilage may be used for defects that involve more than 25 percent of the helical rim or more than two ear planes (helix, antihelix, and scapha) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, in a retrospective review of 25 burned ears reconstructed with a costal cartilage framework, only six ears had an excellent cosmetic result, and seven had a good result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Successful outcome of reconstruction of the burned ear depended on the degree of damage to the surrounding tissues. Coverage of the cartilage framework by unburned mastoid skin was a critical factor for an acceptable outcome in this study. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defects of the helical rims can be covered by local helical advancement techniques (Antia-Buch flap) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], or by tube pedicle flaps from the retroauricular skin. Local flaps and helical advancement flaps may provide sufficient coverage for defects that involve the upper or middle third of the ear, but autologous conchal or costal cartilage may be necessary to reconstruct the auricle. Skin cover can be provided by tube pedicles, or a combination of temporoparietal fascial flap and skin grafting.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111243705\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burns to the eyelid, periorbital region, sclera, conjunctiva, and cornea are classified as ocular burns. The eyes must always be evaluated in burns to the face, and an ophthalmologist should be consulted<strong> </strong>and a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> test is performed to assess the presence of corneal damage. Thermal and chemical ocular burns may result in exposure keratopathy, infection, and loss of central <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. </p><p>Immediate and copious irrigation with sterile saline solution should be performed for chemical burns. A topical ophthalmologic anesthetic can be used in the eyes to facilitate irrigation, and a non-steroid-containing topical antimicrobial ointment can be applied to the eyes.</p><p>Burned eyelashes and eschar should be debrided. An eye patch may be needed in the case of a thermal injury or lid retraction from a splash injury. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Artificial tears</a> are used if the lacrimal ducts are burned. For pain relief, oral or systemic analgesics are effective, and cool saline compresses can be applied to the eyelids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111243712\"><span class=\"h3\">Eyelid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eyelid burns occur in approximately 10 percent of all thermal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The eyelid is composed of an anterior and a posterior lamella. The anterior lamella consists of skin, subcutaneous tissues, and the striated orbicularis muscle. The posterior lamella includes the tarsal plate, a layer of smooth muscle (M&uuml;ller's palpebral muscle), and the bulbar conjunctiva.<strong> </strong>Reconstruction of the eyelid multilamellar structures present formidable challenges, due to the lack of pliable tissue for cover, mucosal tissue for lining, and support tissue for mechanical integrity, and delayed scar maturation. There is no consensus on the best reconstructive procedures for eyelid burns.</p><p>Because of the complexity of the anatomy and the inflammatory response to the burn, reconstruction should be delayed for at least nine months following the injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Prior to reconstruction, the eye is protected from trauma using topical antibiotics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blepharitis#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blepharitis&quot;, section on 'Topical antibiotics'</a>). Reconstruction of the anterior lamella with tarsal involvement may be performed with split- or full-thickness graft; however, multiple procedures to release recurrent contractures may be required. Reconstruction of anterior lamellar defects without tarsal involvement includes direct closure of small burns, full-thickness or partial-thickness skin grafts, and local flaps.</p><p>Reconstruction of full-thickness defects involving both lamellae depends on the size of the defect. Defects involving one-third to one-half of the upper lids can be reconstructed with direct closure or myocutaneous flaps. For more extensive defects, the options include bridging techniques (occlusive or eyelid-sharing) or non-bridging techniques with lamellar flaps and posterior lamellar graft (hard palate, nasal or buccal mucosa) or bilamellar grafts with orbicularis mobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Free tissue transfer (eg, radial forearm flap, anterolateral thigh flap) is an option to reconstruct upper and lower eyelids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Reconstruction of the eyelid depends on the depth of the burn and the amount of unburned pliable tissue available. Any eyelid burn, with the exception of a very superficial burn, will create eyelid retraction and cicatricial ectropion. The following illustrates our algorithm for reconstructing eyelid burns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <strong>superficial</strong> burns of the anterior lamellar structures, the reconstruction involves simple release of the contracture and full-thickness skin grafting. Hooding of the medial canthus is usually addressed with a 5-flap plasty or a V-M plasty, which combines the principles of the V-Y plasty and the Z-plasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <strong>deeper</strong>, more extensive defects of the anterior lamellar structures, we use tissue from the lower lid, with or without skin grafts to provide support if the tarsal plate is missing, if it is available and unburned. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The main concern to take into account is to provide cover for the cornea to avoid exposure keratopathy and desiccation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The main problem faced is to replicate the delicate thin, mobile structure represented by the eyelid lamellae. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If no local tissue is available, distant reconstruction with regional flaps (eg, temporoparietal flap, forehead flap) or free flap (eg, posterior auricular chondrocutaneous, anterior lateral thigh, radial forearm flap) may be necessary. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111243719\"><span class=\"h3\">Eyebrow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burns to the eyebrow destroy the hair-bearing potential of this skin. The eyebrow can be reconstructed with use of superficial temporal artery island flap, composite graft from scalp, or mini or micrografts from scalp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In our practice, we use mainly strip grafts with occasional use of micrografts as these offer minimal morbidity with good outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16666805\"><span class=\"h3\">Eyelashes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hair follicular unit transplantation offers the most delicate and cosmetically pleasing outcomes for reconstruction of burned eyelashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The techniques that we use are similar to the hair-bearing options discussed in eyebrow reconstruction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111243726\"><span class=\"h2\">Lip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reconstruction of the burned lip is performed to improve functional and aesthetic outcomes. Microstomia is a complication of the burn and causes limitations of speech, jaw movement, tongue movement, oral intake, oral continence, and oral hygiene as well as facial distortion. Injury to the commissures is particularly debilitating. No ideal method of reconstruction has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In contrast to reconstruction for burns to the eyelid after scar maturation, early surgical intervention before scar maturation may be necessary to reestablish oral competence. In a retrospective review of 18 patients suffering with microstomia from facial burns, reconstruction of the oral commissures performed by scar excision and local mucosal flap advancement, wound closure with full-thickness or partial-thickness skin grafts, or rhomboid mucosal flaps resulted in acceptable aesthetics and good functional recovery in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Mucosal advancement flaps provided better aesthetic and functional results than skin grafts. The use of a trapeze-flap plasty has been reported to achieve a normal size oral opening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Other innovative options include the use of cervical tubed flaps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], pre-expanded scalp tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], or procedures based on oncologic techniques. All local advancement procedures are limited by availability of perioral unburned skin. Free flap reconstruction can be used when no unburned skin or oral mucosa is available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-procedures-used-in-the-management-of-burn-injuries#H843899998\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical procedures used in the management of burn injuries&quot;, section on 'Burn wound coverage'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111243733\"><span class=\"h2\">Nose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nose is a central, prominent, and frequently deformed structure in the burned face. Cosmetic and functional embarrassment for the patient is considerable. The secondary reconstruction starts only when scars are mature, usually after two years. The nose is a tridimensional tissue pyramid consisting of three tissue layers: inner lining, framework support, and soft tissue cover. Depending on the depth of the burn, all three layers may require reconstruction. There is no consensus on the best reconstructive or aesthetic procedure to use to reconstruct the burned nose.</p><p>Full-thickness or partial-thickness skin grafts or a combination of grafts and a dermal substitute may be used for partial-thickness defects with intact framework and lining. Local flaps (eg, bilateral nasolabial) or regional flaps can be used for larger defects. Regional flaps include forehead flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], deltopectoral flaps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], cervical tube pedicle flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], flaps based in the temporal artery territory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], or complex options such as a pre-expanded scalp skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Framework reconstruction is mandatory for deep burn defects with loss of the tridimensional projection. Full reconstruction is needed to support, augment, or enhance the nasal projection. Reconstructive options include costal cartilage, bone grafts from the radius or ulna, and split calvarial bone graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Alloplastic materials can be used to increase the nasal projection; however, extrusion, infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prosthesis displacement are complications of this technique.</p><p>The classic aesthetic rhinoplasty procedures are applicable to burns involving the nose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a retrospective review of 13 patients with complete or subtotal nasal burns and severely burned or grafted skin, there was no necrosis of the tissues following aesthetic procedures. The use of free flaps (eg, prelaminated osteocutaneous radial forearm flap) combines tissue for lining, support, and coverage of the burn defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Scar contractures occluding the nostrils are usually managed with a combination of release, local flaps, and full-thickness skin grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111243740\"><span class=\"h2\">Cheek</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burns to the cheek are treated conservatively with local topical agents (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care&quot;</a>). If conservative management will result in early scarring or distortion of surrounding sphincter structures (eg, nose, eye canthi) because the burn is deep, or if the burn is not healed in three weeks, primary reconstruction can be performed with skin grafts from the scalp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Burn scars mature between 12 and 24 months following the injury. Secondary reconstruction is planned following full scar management therapy to obtain as much supple tissue quantity as possible. The full-thickness scalp graft provides the best match in terms of texture and color for the cheek. The size of the graft from the donor site is limited due to excessive scarring and alopecia.

However, dermal regeneration templates cannot be used without subsequent autografting. Early reconstruction with Integra does not offer results superior to grafting.

The first stage involves placing a single rectangular tissue into a subcutaneous pocket created in the anterior neck and the port in the infraclavicular area. The expander is inflated intraoperatively. The second stage involves inflating the expander. Once maximum insertion is achieved, the expander is removed, the burn defect is excised, and the tissue flap is advanced to cover the defect.

Free tissue transfer allows for complete skin reconstruction and can be performed in one stage. If the superficial temporal vessels are damaged, arterial branches of the external carotid artery and internal jugular vein may be used. The latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap has a long pedicle and provides the best coverage. However, muscle flap atrophy can result in delayed exposure of the calvarium. Other options for coverage of the near-total defect of the scalp include radial forearm flap, parascapular and anterolateral thigh perforator flaps, and omentum. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1943265\"><span class=\"h3\">Exposed calvarium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An exposed calvarium can by covered with either a free flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>] or tissue expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. If the integrity of the calvarium is compromised by damage to the bone tables of the skull leaving exposed meningeal or neural tissue content, neurosurgical consultation is necessary prior to burn reconstruction. If only the outer table is compromised, the area can be induced to granulate with the use of carefully performed burring of the outer table to the diploe, with or without postoperative topical negative pressure therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=negative-pressure-wound-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Negative pressure wound therapy&quot;</a>.)

Exposed dura presents an additional risk to patient recovery, and a neurosurgical consultation is necessary prior to burn reconstruction.

Secondary reconstruction of the burned neck aims to import pliable tissue to this delicate area. Burns can result in contractures that foreshorten the mentocervical distance, decrease cervical movement, and fix the head and neck in the flexion position. In severe cases, the dense scars can lead to complete fusion of the chin and the chest skin. The inferior pull of the contracture on the chin and adjacent tissues leads to an open-mouth appearance, with redundant lower lip and gum showing. This rigid deformity complicates oral continence, the ability to eat, and an intubation. Evidence for reconstruction of the neck is based upon observational studies and the clinical setting. </p><p>Scar maturation occurs in approximately 12 to 24 months. Once scars are mature, management of the scar is completed through splintage and occupational therapy intervention, followed by secondary reconstruction of cervical contractures. Choice of reconstruction procedures should be based on tissue availability, degree of restriction of movement, and neck zones involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>Small linear contracture bands can be released with Z-plasty-type procedures in order to realign or release scars. Transposition flaps will cover small to moderate neck burn defects satisfactorily, providing that the neck fascia and the platysma muscle are incorporated into the design. Postburn neck contractures can be lengthened 100 to 200 percent using the trapeze-flap plasty technique, described as the opposite transposition of trapezoid scar and fascial flaps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Both flaps include scars, adipose tissue, platysma muscle, and deep cervical fascia. This procedure can eliminate the contracture and restore the mentocervical angle and head movement. In one series, functional results were good in 24 of 26 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. </p><p>Other options to release burn scar neck contractures include split thickness skin grafts (STSGs), full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs), and dermal regeneration templates. STSGs are not the ideal option, as contractures can recur due to the lack of dermal elements that provide pliability. In patients with extensive burns, the availability of FTSGs may be limited. When available, FTSGs are an ideal option as they are more pliable and develop fewer contractures in comparison with STSGs. Dermal regeneration templates provide improved pliability and better cosmetic results than STSGs. In a retrospective multicenter review of 89 burn patients with 127 contracture release procedures, the dermal regeneration templates (Integra) resulted in favorable functional outcomes and a high rate of patient satisfaction, similar to those of full-thickness grafts without the donor-site morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Negative pressure dressings provide an excellent option to control graft position and reduce the formation of hematomas. Grafted areas can also be bolstered with tie-over dressings consisting of nanocrystalline silver to provide local infection control.

Reconstruction based on an undamaged superficial cervical artery with tissue expansion and the superficial transverse cervical artery combined with the bilobed flap principle resulted in a significant improvement in neck range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>A complex algorithm was described for reconstruction of cervical burn defects by classifying the neck into different territories and applying a free flap option to each territory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The reconstructive territories were classified as central above, central below, central above and below, and lateral. The functional outcome of improved range of motion was best in the central above territory, while etiology of the burn and time between injury and reconstruction had no impact on the functional outcome.</p><p>Free flaps (eg, inguinal region, scapula, anterolateral thigh) can be used to resurface wide contractures in the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/71,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,74</a>]. Optimal neck contouring is difficult to obtain because of the bulkiness and the limitations in the size of the flaps. To improve aesthetic and functional results, free flap donor sites in the groin and scapular regions were prepared by controlled tissue expansion prior to transfer to the neck in eight patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-face-scalp-and-neck/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. All eight patients demonstrated full neck extension and a good aesthetic result; five required minor secondary flap revisions. The advantages of the pre-expansion of the donor site include an increase in tissue for reconstruction; an increase in vascularity, pliability, and elasticity of the donor flap; and minimal donor site scarring. The disadvantages are that this is a two-staged procedure, and the risks associated with tissue expansion.

Following resuscitation and stabilization, management of the burn wounds becomes the next priority. The later effects of burns, which are related to loss of normal tissue and scarring, include limitation of movement, pain, disfigurement, and social embarrassment. The type of reconstruction procedure selected depends on the location of the burn, the extensiveness of the injury, and the availability of donor skin and tissue. The optimal reconstructive procedure will vary from patient to patient.
