This topic reviews the etiologies of abdominal pain in adults. The emergent and non-urgent evaluation of abdominal pain of adults discussed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-abdominal-pain-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute abdominal pain in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ABDOMINAL PAIN</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic basis for abdominal pain</strong> &ndash; Pain receptors in the abdomen respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli. Stretch is the principal mechanical stimulus involved in visceral nociception, although distention, contraction, traction, compression, and torsion are also perceived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Visceral receptors responsible for these sensations are located on serosal surfaces, within the mesentery, and within the walls of hollow viscera. Visceral mucosal receptors respond primarily to chemical stimuli, while other visceral nociceptors respond to chemical or mechanical stimuli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The events responsible for the perception of abdominal pain are not completely understood, but depend upon the type of stimulus and the interpretation of visceral nociceptive inputs in the central nervous system (CNS). As an example, the gastric mucosa is insensitive to pressure or chemical stimuli. However, in the presence of inflammation, these same stimuli can cause pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The threshold for perceiving pain may vary among individuals and in certain diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Localization</strong> &ndash; The type and density of visceral afferent nerves makes the localization of visceral pain imprecise. However, a few general rules are useful:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most digestive tract pain is perceived in the midline because of bilaterally symmetric innervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. Pain that is clearly lateralized most likely arises from the ipsilateral kidney, ureter, ovary, or somatically innervated structures, which have predominantly unilateral innervation. Exceptions to this rule include the gallbladder and ascending and descending colons which, although bilaterally innervated, have predominant innervation located on their ipsilateral sides.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Visceral pain is perceived in the spinal segment at which the visceral afferent nerves enter the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As an example, afferent nerves mediating pain arising from the small intestine enter the spinal cord between T8 to L1. Thus, distension of the small intestine is usually perceived in the periumbilical region.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Referred pain</strong> &ndash; Pain originating in the viscera may sometimes be perceived as originating from a site distant from the affected organ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61375 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Referred pain is usually located in the cutaneous dermatomes sharing the same spinal cord level as the visceral inputs. As an example, nociceptive inputs from the gallbladder enter the spinal cord at T5 to T10. Thus, pain from an inflamed gallbladder may be perceived in the scapula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61375 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The quality of referred pain is aching and perceived to be near the surface of the body. In addition to pain, two other correlates of referred pain can be detected: skin hyperalgesia and increased muscle tone of the abdominal wall (which accounts for the abdominal wall rigidity sometimes observed in patients with an acute abdomen).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">UPPER ABDOMINAL PAIN SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper abdominal pain syndromes typically have characteristic locations: right upper quadrant pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F106199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106199 \">table 1</a>), epigastric pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F106200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106200 \">table 2</a>), or left upper quadrant pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F106201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106201 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629460690\"><span class=\"h2\">Right upper quadrant pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biliary and hepatic etiologies cause right upper quadrant pain syndromes.</p><p>Biliary etiologies include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F106199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106199 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gallstones</strong> &ndash; Symptoms of biliary colic classically include an intense, dull discomfort located in the right upper quadrant, epigastrium, or (less often) substernal area that may radiate to the back (particularly the right shoulder blade).
