People can also have pain from other conditions, such as arthritis, that have nothing to do with their cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568113\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To feel better, first try to avoid doing the things that make your pain worse. You can also try to relax. For example, you can do relaxation exercises or meditate.</p><p>If you have pain, it's important to keep track of your pain and how you treat it. That way, your doctor can use this information to treat your pain better. Keep a list of the medicines you take, how much they ease the pain, and how long the pain relief lasts. When you describe your pain, you can give it a number from 1 to 10. 1 would be &quot;no pain,&quot; and 10 would be &quot;unbearable&quot; (the worst pain ever) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58567\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58567 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568120\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any change in the type of pain you have or where the pain is located</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain that is new</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term pain that gets worse or does not get better with treatment</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568127\"><span class=\"h1\">Which medicines work best on cancer pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors usually use medicines called &quot;opioids&quot; to treat cancer pain. Opioids are also sometimes called &quot;narcotics.&quot; They are a group of medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">morphine</a> (sample brand names: MS Contin, MSIR), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">oxycodone</a> (sample brand names: OxyContin, Oxy IR), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fentanyl</a> (sample brand names: Duragesic, Fentora).</p><p>Opioids can work in different ways. They can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start to work slowly and have effects that last a long time, treating pain over many hours &ndash; These medicines usually come as a slow-acting (called &quot;sustained release&quot;) pill, or as a patch that goes on the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start to work quickly and have effects that last a short time, to treat pain that starts or gets worse suddenly &ndash; These medicines usually come as a fast-acting (called &quot;immediate release&quot;) pill, liquid, tablet that melts under the tongue, or spray that can be used under the tongue or in the nose.</p><p/><p>Doctors usually prescribe both types of opioids to treat pain in people with cancer. Most people use a slow-acting opioid every day to prevent pain. If they have episodes of pain while they are taking the slow-acting opioid, then they can also take a fast-acting opioid to control the pain.</p><p>Depending on your symptoms and other conditions, your doctor might prescribe other types of medicines to treat pain. Most of the time, people take these medicines in addition to their opioids. Other medicines can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Acetaminophen</a> (brand name: Tylenol) or a group of medicines called &quot;NSAIDs&quot; &ndash; NSAIDs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that are usually used for other conditions &ndash; Some medicines that treat other issues can also help with certain types of cancer pain. Examples include steroids, antidepressants, and medicines used to treat bone problems. These medicines are usually used along with opioids in people with cancer pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568134\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know about my pain medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should know that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It's important to take your slow-acting opioids as prescribed, even if you aren't in pain. The goal of treatment is to keep your pain under control all the time, and not just treat it when it happens. If you aren't in pain, it means that the pain medicines are working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You need to let your doctor or nurse know if your medicine isn't helping enough with your pain, or if the effect isn't lasting long enough between doses. Your doctor can increase your dose, increase how often you take your medicine, or prescribe a different medicine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioids can have side effects. Common side effects include constipation, sleepiness, and nausea. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any side effects. That way, he or she can treat your side effects or change your medicine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You need to keep your opioids in a safe place so that people don't steal them. People might try to steal your opioids so that they can make money by selling them illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You will not get addicted to your opioids. People often worry that they are getting addicted to their medicine when they need higher and higher doses to treat their pain. This is not the case. Your body might need higher doses because your condition is getting worse, or because you have a higher &quot;tolerance&quot; for the medicine. Tolerance is when a body gets used to a medicine, so the medicine doesn't work as well as it used to. Tolerance is not the same as addiction.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568141\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there other kinds of treatments that can help with pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your medicines don't ease your pain enough, talk with your doctor or nurse about other possible treatments. Depending on your symptoms and the cause of your pain, he or she might recommend a procedure. This could include getting a shot of medicine into the painful area, or a procedure to &quot;deaden&quot; the nerve that leads to the painful area.</p><p>He or she might also recommend that you work with a physical therapist, mental health expert, or alternative medicine expert. Alternative medicine includes treatments such as acupuncture and massage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568148\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioids-for-short-term-treatment-of-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Opioids for short-term treatment of pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
