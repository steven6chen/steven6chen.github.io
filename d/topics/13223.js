This group proposed the term CKD-MBD, which has been broadly accepted, to define the broad clinical syndrome that develops as a systemic bone disorder due to mineral, skeletal, and vascular abnormalities that occur in association with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Renal osteodystrophy is one aspect of CKD-MBD that refers to the bone pathology alone. Changes that occur in the homeostatic mechanisms that regulate serum concentrations of calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) lead to the development of CKD-MBD and renal osteodystrophy.

As a result, several societies have advocated developing a staging system to identify patients in whom interventions might delay CKD progression. In 2012, the KDIGO pediatric working group revised the 2002 classification of pediatric CKD by the KDOQI Clinical Practice Guideline for Chronic Kidney Disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

In these patients, calculated GFR based upon serum creatinine can be compared with normative age-appropriate values to detect kidney impairment. The KDIGO guideline suggests that a GFR value more than one standard deviation below the mean should raise concern and prompt more intensive monitoring.

As a result, children with CKD stage 2 usually have no signs or symptoms of bone abnormalities. However, these children may have evidence of abnormalities on laboratory testing (eg, decreased serum calcitriol [1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D] and elevated serum parathyroid hormone [PTH]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This period should be used to educate the child and family about CKD and its impact on bone metabolism. This discussion should highlight the need for laboratory monitoring and future interventions that will prevent and treat CKD-MBD.</p><p>Children with stage 3 CKD should be monitored for evidence of bone disease by physical examination and laboratory evaluation. Physical findings include muscle pain, weakness, and bony changes, such as varus and valgus deformities of the long bones. Laboratory abnormalities of bone metabolism (eg, elevated PTH) are common in stage 3 disease and require therapeutic interventions.

The severity of bone disease rises with increasing progression of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-dialysis &ndash; In a case series of 52 children with pre-dialysis CKD, bone biopsy demonstrated increased bone turnover in 0, 13, and 29 percent, and defective mineralization in 29, 42, and 79 percent in children with CKD stage 2, 3, and <span class=\"nowrap\">4/5,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In children with CKD stages 3 to 4, osteitis fibrosa cystica appears to be the most common form of renal osteodystrophy, as illustrated in a small study of 11 children at the start of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Histologic findings included adynamic bone disease, osteitis fibrosa cystica, mixed osteodystrophy, and osteomalacia in 27, 24, 10, and 2 percent of the cohort, respectively. There appears to be a slow shift over the years from a predominance of high bone turnover disease (ie, osteitis fibrosa cystica) to the more frequent development of low bone turnover states (ie, adynamic bone disease) in children on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Unlike in adults, bone density studies in children with CKD who are also on dialysis have shown acceptable bone mineral content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p>The following is a brief review of the different forms of renal osteodystrophy.

The reduction in bone turnover is the result of a decreased number of bone-forming and bone-resorbing cells, and causes an increase in the volume of unmineralized bone. In the past, this disorder resulted from aluminum toxicity due to the administration of aluminum-containing phosphate binders, which are no longer recommended.

The other forms are seen in children with severe CKD, and are often due to therapeutic interventions (eg, excess suppression of the parathyroid gland from calcium-containing phosphate binders and vitamin D analogues).
