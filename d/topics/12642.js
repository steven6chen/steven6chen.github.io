Extrapolation from the results of these trials does not necessarily confirm that amlodipine or felodipine are safe in patients with an acute STEMI.

In deciding when to transfuse, individual patient characteristics such as the rate of blood loss and severity of myocardial ischemia need to be taken into account.
