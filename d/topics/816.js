These include asthma exacerbations, suboptimal lung development (children), loss of lung function over time (adults), and adverse effects from asthma medications. Proper asthma management attempts to minimize the patient's likelihood of experiencing these outcomes. Specific goals for reducing risk include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of recurrent exacerbations and need for emergency department or hospital care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of reduced lung growth in children, and loss of lung function in adults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimization of pharmacotherapy with minimal or no adverse effects</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Currently, the majority of medical visits for asthma are for urgent care. Effective asthma management, however, requires a proactive, preventative approach, similar to the treatment of hypertension or diabetes. Routine follow-up visits for patients with active asthma are recommended, at a frequency of every one to six months, depending upon the severity of asthma. These visits should be used to assess multiple aspects of the patient's asthma and to discuss steps that patients can take to intervene early in asthma exacerbations (an asthma &quot;action plan&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The aspects of the patient's asthma that should be assessed at each visit include the following: signs and symptoms, pulmonary function, quality of life, exacerbations, adherence with treatment, medication side effects, and patient satisfaction with care.</p><p>By consensus from panels of asthma experts, well-controlled asthma is characterized by daytime symptoms no more than twice per week and nighttime symptoms no more than twice per month. SABAs for relief of asthma symptoms should be needed less often than three days out of the week, and there should be no interference with normal activity (preventative use of a SABA, such as prior to exercise, is acceptable even if used in this way on a daily basis). Peak flow should remain normal or near-normal. Oral glucocorticoid courses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urgent care visits should be needed no more than once per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Assessment of control in patients of different ages is summarized in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52149%7EPULM%2F73634%7EPULM%2F65972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52149 graphicRef73634 graphicRef65972 \">table 1A-C</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms over the past two to four weeks should be assessed at each visit.

Several quick and validated questionnaires addressing these specific measures of asthma control, like the Asthma Control Test, have been published (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50620\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef50620 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81872\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81872 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/5-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83730847\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following questions are representative of those used in validated questionnaires to assess asthma control:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has your asthma awakened you at night or in the early morning?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often have you been needing to use your quick-acting relief medication to relieve symptoms of cough, shortness of breath, or chest tightness?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you needed any unscheduled care for your asthma, including calling in, an office visit, or an emergency department visit?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you been able to participate in <span class=\"nowrap\">school/work</span> and recreational activities as desired?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are measuring your peak flow, has it been lower than your personal best?

The 2007 NAEPP guidelines state a preference for use of spirometry in medical offices, when available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Children older than five years of age are usually able to perform the peak flow or spirometric maneuver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Office monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of PEFR can be a useful indicator of airflow obstruction, the hallmark finding of asthma. PEFR can be measured with handheld peak flow meters in settings not equipped with a spirometer. Average normal values for men, women, and children are listed in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57257%7EPULM%2F62839%7EPULM%2F64420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57257 graphicRef62839 graphicRef64420 \">table 2A-C</a>). Adolescents have values closer to children than to adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>It is important to understand the limitations of PEFR. A reduced peak flow is not synonymous with airway obstruction; spirometry is needed to distinguish conclusively an obstructive from restrictive abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Also, the accuracy of a single peak flow measurement to detect the presence of airflow obstruction is limited, given the large variability of PEFR among healthy individuals of the same age, height, and gender (&plusmn;20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Nonetheless, repeated measurements of PEFR in an individual patient are useful for determining relative changes or trends in asthma control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/17,20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20-24</a>]. PEFR monitoring is best used in patients in whom the diagnosis of asthma has been previously established with a more complete evaluation. The use of PEFR monitoring and its limitations are presented in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peak expiratory flow rate monitoring in asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Spirometry, which additionally measures forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC), can be used to document airflow obstruction (by demonstration of a reduced FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio) and provides additional information that is useful in monitoring asthma, such as risk for exacerbations, by detecting important reductions in lung function in patients who have few symptoms or physical findings of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/16,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,25</a>]. Spirometry can detect airflow obstruction in the presence of a normal peak expiratory flow. As mentioned previously, the 2007 NAEPP and GINA guidelines recommend the use of spirometry in practices that are regularly caring for patients with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary function testing in asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Home monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Home monitoring of the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) may be helpful in patients with moderate to severe asthma. It is also useful in patients who poorly perceive limitations in airflow. These individuals cannot be easily identified at the outset of care, although over time they display a lack of awareness of increasing impairment, and typically seek care for exacerbations only after symptoms have become severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Peak flow meters for individual use are widely available, inexpensive (approximately $20), and easy to use. However, the resulting measurements are highly dependent upon the patient's technique. It is therefore important that the clinician periodically checks the patient's use of the meter, and corrects any mistakes in technique. Instructions for patients are provided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-a-peak-flow-meter-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: How to use a peak flow meter (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patient should be instructed in how to establish a baseline measure of peak flow when feeling entirely well: the &quot;personal best&quot; peak flow value. The personal best PEFR is then used to determine the normal PEFR range, which is between 80 and 100 percent of the patient's personal best. Readings below this normal range indicate airway narrowing, a change that may occur before symptoms are perceived by the patient. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Asthma action plan'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Novel forms of monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurements of lung function such as peak flow and spirometry assess asthma control based on airway diameter. However, it would also be desirable to measure airway inflammation directly. Quantitative analysis of expectorated sputum for eosinophilia and measurement of the concentration of nitric oxide in exhaled breath are two modalities currently being explored for this purpose. Studies have reached conflicting conclusions about whether regularly measuring these markers could help optimize asthma management. Nitrogen oxide analyzers are commercially available, but their use has been mostly limited to referral centers and hospital-based pulmonary function laboratories. The use of expectorated sputum eosinophilia and exhaled nitric oxide analysis in the management of asthma are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-severe-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of severe asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;, section on 'Airway inflammation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exhaled nitric oxide analysis and applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should enable patients to become active partners in managing their asthma. Ideally, this would occur through direct education in the office, as well as adjunctive education by other members of the health care team, emergency department providers, pharmacists, and organized programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The effectiveness of direct one-on-one education by the primary clinician, in particular, is well supported by evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Patient education decreases hospitalizations due to asthma, improves daily function, and improves patient satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. A well-informed and motivated patient can assume a large measure of control over his or her asthma care.</p><p>Patients must learn how to monitor their symptoms and pulmonary function; they must understand what triggers their asthma attacks and how to avoid or decrease exposure to these triggers; and they must understand what medicine to take and how to use inhalers properly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103302 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103303 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51020%7EPI%2F109205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51020 graphicRef109205 \">table 5A-B</a>). If they have difficulty taking the medications regularly, they need help devising methods to improve compliance. The specific information that should be conveyed to the patient is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-do-patients-need-to-know-about-their-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;What do patients need to know about their asthma?&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma action plan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's normal PEFR value can be used to construct a personalized &quot;asthma action plan&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55900\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55900 \">form 2</a>). Symptom-based plans appear to be equally effective. The asthma action plan provides specific directions for daily management and for adjusting medications in response to increasing symptoms or decreasing PEFR. Instructions and forms for asthma action plans are presented elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-control-to-enhance-asthma-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger control to enhance asthma management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adults should be questioned about symptoms not only in the home, but also in the workplace, as asthma can be exacerbated by both irritant and allergen exposures in occupational settings. Patterns of symptoms that suggest occupational triggers are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69644\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69644 \">table 7</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

A prospective, randomized trial applied the management recommendations of previous NAEPP guidelines to approximately 1500 patients with all severities of asthma over the course of one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/an-overview-of-asthma-management/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Guideline-based management resulted in significant improvement in health-related quality of life in most patients, regardless of disease severity. In this study, subjects who required inhaled GCs were randomly assigned to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluticasone</a> propionate (FP) alone or the combination of fluticasone propionate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a> (FP + S). Subjects were evaluated every three months and medications were stepped up as needed (although the protocol did not allow for stepping down of therapy). With both treatments, the majority of patients achieved well-controlled or totally-controlled asthma; good control was achieved slightly more often with FP + S. The greatest improvements occurred in the first few months of therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO REFER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both pulmonologists and <span class=\"nowrap\">allergists/immunologists</span> have specialty training in asthma care.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Goals of asthma treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective asthma management requires a preventative approach, with regularly scheduled visits during which symptoms are assessed, pulmonary function is monitored, medications are adjusted, and ongoing education is provided.

Patients with moderate to severe asthma and those with poor perception of increasing asthma symptoms may also benefit from assessment of their peak expiratory flow rate at home. A personalized asthma action plan should be provided with detailed instructions on how to adjust asthma medications based upon changes in symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lung function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55900\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55900 \">form 2</a>).
