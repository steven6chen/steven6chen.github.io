The burden of disease due to malaria across much of the world has selected for a series of very visible traits of major medical importance, including the alleles of genes encoding hemoglobin, red cell enzymes, and membrane proteins. Furthermore, as might be expected from the intricate life cycle of the parasite in the human host, it now appears that many other genes may also influence the outcome of infection, including some that modulate the immune responses and others that encode for endothelial proteins.</p><p>The genetic resistance to malarial infection, particularly falciparum malaria, associated with the hemoglobinopathies, will be reviewed here. Resistance associated with abnormalities in red cell surface antigens or cytoskeleton is discussed separately.

Genetic resistance to the blood stage has been extensively documented, but the association of HLA class I allotypes with protection from malaria suggests genetic traits resistance also during the hepatic stage of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Genetic resistance to <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria at the erythrocytic stage may involve one or more of the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of merozoite entry into the red cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairment in intracellular growth of the parasite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of the erythrocyte lysis that occurs at the end of parasite maturation, which leads to release of merozoites into the bloodstream</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced phagocytosis of parasite-infected red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes to endothelial cells, uninfected red blood cells, platelets or antigen-presenting cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced immune responses to malarial infection</p><p/><p>Genetic resistance at the erythrocytic stage has led to the selection of red cell genetic defects at gene frequencies (greater than 1 percent) that imply positive selective pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. These defects include hemoglobinopathies (eg, hemoglobins [Hbs] S, C, E, and thalassemia), erythrocyte membrane defects (eg, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis and some forms of elliptocytosis), and metabolic abnormalities (eg, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] deficiency).</p><p>Although all of the four common types of human malaria (<em>P. falciparum</em>, <em>ovale</em>, <em>vivax</em>, and <em>malariae</em>) can cause selective pressure on the human population, and although <em>P. vivax</em> does cause severe disease and may also indirectly contribute to morbidity and mortality, this effect is most obvious with <em>P. falciparum</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

A number of genes, including those for sickle hemoglobin (Hb S), the thalassemias, and a range of red cell membrane and enzyme abnormalities, share a distribution that is strikingly similar to that of malaria. It has now been confirmed that many of these traits provide substantial protection against the disease.</p><p>Intriguingly, most of these red cell genetic defects in human populations have been selected during the last 3000 to 5000 years with the emergence of agriculture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, other factors also affect the outcome of individual malaria infections including previous exposure and immune status and determinants of parasite virulence.</p><p>Mackinnon and colleagues examined pedigree data collected during longitudinal cohort studies in Sri Lanka [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and calculated 20 percent of the variation in the intensity of disease was explained by repeatable differences between patients, and approximately half of this variation was attributable to host genetics. A similar analysis of the total genetic contribution to malaria infection and disease in Africa showed 25 percent of the total variation in the incidence of hospital admission for malaria was explained by additively acting host genes. Interestingly, only 2 percent of this variation was due to the sickle cell trait, suggesting that the additive effect of the many other, largely undefined, genetic resistance traits is much greater than those at the globin loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>A series of case-control and some cohort studies have explored the role of specific hemoglobinopathies in resistance to malaria. A meta-analysis of these case-control studies showed a decreased risk of severe <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria in individuals with Hb AS (odds ratio [OR] 0.09, 95% CI 0.06-0.12), Hb CC (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.63), Hb AC (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67-0.96), homozygous alpha thalassemia&nbsp;(OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48-0.83), and heterozygous alpha thalassemia&nbsp;(OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.92). However, only Hb AS showed protection from uncomplicated&nbsp;malaria&nbsp;(incidence rate ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.61-0.79), while no hemoglobinopathies&nbsp;led to consistent protection from asymptomatic parasitemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">FALCIPARUM MALARIA AND HEMOGLOBIN S</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early observations suggested that the peculiar distribution of sickle cell trait in African populations might result from a selective advantage against malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. However, the &quot;malaria hypothesis&quot; is generally ascribed to Haldane who, reflecting on the evolving descriptions of the global distribution of beta thalassemia, wrote in 1949:</p><p>&quot;The corpuscles of the anaemic heterozygotes are smaller than normal, and more resistant to hypotonic solutions. It is at least conceivable that they are also more resistant to attacks by the sporozoa which cause malaria, a disease prevalent in Italy, Sicily, and Greece, where the gene is frequent&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Since Haldane's first statement of his &quot;malaria hypothesis,&quot; evidence that many genes provide protection from <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria has accumulated relentlessly. However, transmission experiments have suggested that the &quot;protective hemoglobin variants&quot; (eg, Hb S and Hb C) may be associated with an increase in parasite transmission from the human host to the <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito vector [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Sickle cell trait</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Epidemiological evidence for protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoglobin (Hb) S is a variant form of hemoglobin due to an abnormal beta globin chain. Homozygotes for this mutation (Hb SS) suffer from sickle cell disease, a debilitating form of anemia associated with premature death in most developing countries. Nevertheless, it became increasingly obvious that the carrier state (sickle cell trait, Hb AS) was extremely common in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Support for this hypothesis of a balanced polymorphism was shown through the observation that sickle cell heterozygotes (Hb AS) were less likely to have parasites in their blood and were less likely to die from severe malaria than individuals with Hb AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-trait\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle cell trait&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Case-control studies have since confirmed that sickle cell trait is 90 percent protective against severe and complicated malaria (cerebral malaria and severe anemia) and 60 percent protective against clinical malaria leading to hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/1,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20</a>]. A cohort study has shown that sickle trait confers 60 percent protection against mortality between 2 and 16 months of age in an area of high transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although there is some evidence for protection against mild clinical malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>], this is generally manifest as reduced parasite densities rather than protection against parasitemia per se.</p><p>Malaria infection strongly predisposes to bacteremia, often with non-<em>Salmonella typhi</em> species. In malaria endemic areas, Hb AS may protect not only from malaria but also from bacteremia (odds ratio [OR] 0.36; 95% CI 0.2-0.65) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The most comprehensive longitudinal studies of the role of sickle cell trait in protection from malaria have shown protection from mild disease and from severe disease but negative epistasis (or interaction) between the malaria-protective effects of alpha thalassemia and sickle cell trait. The protection afforded by each condition inherited alone was lost when the two conditions were inherited together, to such a degree that the incidence of both uncomplicated and severe <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria was close to baseline in children with both Hb AS and homozygosity for alpha<sup>+</sup> thalassemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>However, clinical epidemiology has yielded few clues regarding the mechanisms involved in this protection. An early report showed reduced parasite prevalence in heterozygotes (Hb AS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and while subsequent studies did not always confirm these findings, a quantitative trait locus analysis of parasite density has shown that Hb S gene carriage protects individuals with severe <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria against hyperparasitemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Interestingly, in spite of this robust evidence for protection against clinical malaria in childhood, it may be that Hb AS does not protect against placental malaria across a range of parasitologic, clinical, and histologic outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms by which sickle cell trait protects against <em>P. falciparum</em> are not fully understood, and may be both innate and acquired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. However, two principal factors are increased sickling and impaired growth of the parasite during vascular sequestration.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased sickling</strong> &ndash; Studies using cultured parasitized sickle cell trait red cells at physiologic levels of deoxygenation showed that cells infected with ring forms had accelerated sickling compared with noninfected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Accelerated sickling might be beneficial by promoting removal of infected cells from the circulation, a phenomenon that has been called &quot;suicidal&quot; infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, morphologic sickling did not occur in sickle cell trait cells containing trophozoites (which do not circulate since they are sequestered in the microcirculation), although abundant Hb S polymer was detectable by electron microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impaired parasite growth</strong> &ndash; <em>P. falciparum</em> grows normally in infected sickle cell trait cells exposed to 17 percent oxygen, but reducing the oxygen content to 3 percent results in parasite death within a few days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This deoxygenation effect is more pronounced in Hb SC and Hb SS erythrocytes.</p><p/><p>Even if infected sickle trait cells do not undergo morphologic sickling, the parasites are still hampered in the early trophozoite stage. <em>P. falciparum</em> growth is impaired in deoxygenated sickle trait cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>], although the rate of parasite invasion appears to be intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Reduction in growth has been ascribed to dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) in Hb AS or Hb SS erythrocytes. A subset of erythrocyte miRNAs translocates into the parasite and reduces the growth of the parasites by integration of miR-451 and let-7i into essential parasite messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and so inhibition of translation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Ultrastructural studies of parasitized sickle cell anemia cells have shown that, after six hours of deoxygenation, there is disruption of the parasitophorous vacuole and other membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This membrane disruption in sickle cell trait erythrocytes may be due to puncture by spear-like polymers, which might account for the cell lysis observed with parasitized erythrocytes in sickle cell anemia. Another possibility is that the Hb S polymer, with its considerably right shifted oxygen equilibrium curve, kills the parasite by oxygen toxicity as it releases oxygen during the process of polymerization.</p><p>Two mechanisms, which are not mutually exclusive, have been proposed to explain impaired parasite growth or death in deoxygenated sickle trait erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The loss of potassium that accompanies sickling could be detrimental to parasite growth. Sickle erythrocytes have two abnormal mechanisms that facilitate potassium loss. One is the increased activity of the K-Cl cotransporter, due in part to absence of the normal inhibition of the transporter by low oxygen tension, along with retention of its ability to be activated by low pH; both of which occur at sites of stagnant circulation. The second mechanism is increased activity of the calcium-dependent (Gardos) potassium channel, due to a transient increase in cell calcium during sickling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle hemoglobin polymer: Structure and functional properties&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Parasite growth is normal in red cells that have a low potassium concentration induced by incubation with ouabain, which inhibits the Na-K-ATPase pump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. This observation suggests that water loss with promotion of polymerization of Hb S, not a low potassium content, is of primary importance for impairment in parasite growth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another potential explanation for altered growth of malaria parasites in red cells containing Hb S is that erythrocyte miRNAs are translocated into the parasite in a sequence-specific manner. In experimental systems, transfection of the erythrocyte miRNAs miR-451 and let-7i, which are enhanced in erythrocytes containing Hb AS, inhibit parasite growth. In these transfected red blood cells, erythrocyte miRNAs form chimeric transcripts with the 5' end of parasite mRNAs and inhibit translation of targeted parasite mRNAs. However, these observations have not been supported by further evidence from animal or human infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased phagocytosis</strong> &ndash; Enhanced phagocytosis of ring or the early intraerythrocytic form of the parasite may be an explanation for protection in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Malaria-infected erythrocytes containing Hb AS are also susceptible to enhanced phagocytosis of ring forms of the parasite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Membrane-bound hemichromes, autologous immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement C3c fragments, aggregated band 3, and phagocytosis by human monocytes were greater in rings developing in Hb AS erythrocytes than in controls, and phagocytosis of ring-parasitized Hb AS erythrocytes was predominantly complement mediated. Similar findings were reported for red cells in beta thalassemia trait and Hb H disease, but not for alpha thalassemia trait erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, other groups measuring retention of malaria-infected red blood cells by microspheres in vitro or human spleens ex vivo have not shown that ring-stage parasites in Hb AS red cells are retained more than ring-stage parasites in Hb AA red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Altered remodeling of red cell cytoskeleton and trafficking of parasite proteins</strong> &ndash; There is also substantial evidence for altered actin polymerization in malaria-infected Hb AS cells. Hbs S and C affect the trafficking system that directs parasite-encoded proteins to the surface of infected erythrocytes. Hemoglobin oxidation may inhibit actin polymerization and disrupt the actin cytoskeleton and Maurer's clefts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Maurer's clefts moved significantly faster in infected erythrocytes containing the Hb variants S and C than in infected wild-type erythrocytes due to an impaired actin network in infected erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. These defects reduced actin polymerization and as a result reduced protein trafficking from the Maurer's clefts (a parasite-derived organelle). The defects are less in infected red cells containing Hb AS, Hb AC, and Hb F compared with infected red cells containing Hb AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Interestingly, similar defects in actin polymerization can be shown when normal Hb AA erythrocytes are exposed to a transient moderate oxidant stress before invasion of red blood cells, suggesting that the molecular species that interfere with actin reorganization and cytoadhesion are irreversibly oxidized products, such as ferryl hemoglobin, hemichrome radicals, or ferryl heme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduced cytoadherence</strong> &ndash; Infected red blood cells from sickle trait individuals (Hb AS) demonstrate reduced in vitro adhesion to microvascular endothelial cells and blood monocytes relative to adhesion of infected Hb AA red blood cells. Hb AS red cells also show reduced expression on their surface of the variant antigen Pf-EMP-1 (<em>P. falciparum</em> erythrocyte membrane protein-1), the parasite's major cytoadherence ligand and virulence factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Furthermore, reduced cytoadherence in malaria-infected red blood cells compared to that seen in infected cells from patients with sickle cell trait and alpha<sup>+</sup> thalassemia negativity is entirely consistent with epistasis between these two traits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The relative importance of these phenomena in patients with malaria is unclear. There is conflicting experimental evidence for enhanced phagocytosis or retention of ring-stage-infected Hb AS red blood cells compared with ring-stage-infected Hb AA red blood cells. There are consistent experimental data showing reduced expression of the variant antigen, Pf-EMP-1, the parasite's major cytoadherence ligand of infected red blood cells. It is possible that enhanced clearance of ring-stage-infected red cells and reduced adhesion of mature infected red cells both contribute to the remarkable protection due the Hb AS phenotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immune mechanisms</strong> &ndash; A series of intriguing observations suggests that the protection of people with sickle cell trait may be mediated, at least in part, by enhancing the acquired immune response to malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. Such an explicit immune-mediated mechanism(s) would explain observations that the effect of Hb AS on parasite density was strongly age-dependent, only beginning after two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p>Two studies have found significantly raised gamma globulin levels in young Hb AS children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. More specifically, children with the Hb AS phenotype had higher levels of anti-sporozoite antibodies and agglutinating antibodies to variant surface antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] and significantly increased lymphoproliferative responses to malaria antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, the antibody response against a microarray of <em>P. falciparum</em> proteins showed no significant difference in antibody responses in children with Hb AS and Hb AA controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. It remains possible that Hb AS and Hb AC may modulate other protective immune responses.</p><p>There are some direct epidemiological data suggesting that protection mediated by sickle hemoglobin may involve the accelerated acquisition of malaria-specific immunity. The age-specific protection afforded by Hb AS against clinical malaria in children living on the coast of Kenya increased from 20 percent in the first two years of life to a maximum of 56 percent by the age of 10 years, returning to 30 percent in children more than 10 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>There are no equivalent data for the other hemoglobinopathies; a small study in Gambian children with thalassemia trait showed no differences in their immune responses to malaria compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of an enhanced immunologic response has not been established either in vitro or by ex vivo clinical studies.

In studies of sickle transgenic mice, <em>P. chabaudi adami</em>, <em>P. berghei</em>, and the <em>P. yoelii</em> strains were used in nonlethal and lethal infections. In these studies, a transgenic mouse line expressing both the sickle gene and human alpha globin genes was used.

This protective effect was attributed to induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in hematopoietic cells, via a mechanism involving the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and generation of carbon monoxide (CO) as a byproduct of heme catabolism by HO-1.

The first line of defense is a dramatic acceleration of sickling rates in parasitized sickle cell trait cells that facilitates their removal from the circulation. Parasites that escape this process show impaired growth when the host cells become hypoxic and adhere to the endothelium of venules. Second, ring-stage-infected red blood cells from people with Hb AS undergo increased phagocytosis compared with infected red blood cells from people with Hb AA. These effects may lead to an accelerated acquisition of immunity to malaria. It is unclear if any of these mechanism(s) is significant in vivo.</p><p>It has been generally thought that people with sickle cell anemia (Hb SS) remain susceptible to malaria, although the relative risk of malaria in Africans with sickle cell anemia has not been established. While patients with sickle cell anemia may be less likely to die from cerebral or hepatic malaria, they may succumb to other effects of infection (eg, volume depletion, acidosis, cytokine release).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMOGLOBIN C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hemoglobin C (Hb C) gene has its maximum frequency in northern Burkina Faso, and the prevalence decreases concentrically in surrounding areas. A case-control study involving 4348 Mossi subjects from Burkina Faso suggested a 29 and 93 percent reduction in risk of clinical malaria in Hb C heterozygotes (Hb AC) and homozygotes (Hb CC), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

However, the data for protection against mild malaria for Hb AC heterozygotes are less clear, as two prospective cohort studies from Mali have shown inconsistent results. A study from Bamako in Mali showed that mild malaria incidence was higher in Hb AC children than in Hb AA children (adjusted incidence rate ratio 1.15; 95% CI 1.01-1.32) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>], while a similar study in the town of Bandiagara in a younger-aged cohort showed fewer episodes of clinical malaria, and a lower cumulative parasite burden in children with Hb AC compared to controls with Hb AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vitro studies in oxygenated Hb CC cells have shown the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No abnormality in parasite invasion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal growth during the first growth cycle but a markedly reduced number of ring forms following the schizont stage, with degenerated schizonts observed on day 4.

These factors may also contribute to the advantages of being a carrier of thalassemia, since this disorder is associated with a significant slowing of the postnatal switch from Hb F to Hb A.

Globally, the thalassemias are the most common single gene disorders thus far described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Overall, gene frequencies &gt;0.10 are the norm in tropical populations, whereas frequencies are somewhat lower in the subtropics and rare in the temperate zones. Moreover, isolated examples of extreme frequencies have been described in particular ethnic groups, particularly in certain tribes in India and Nepal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/96-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-99</a>]. In one of these tribal groups, the Tharu people of Nepal, the alpha thalassemia gene frequency reaches 0.78 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>While the global distribution of the thalassemias provides reasonable evidence for malaria protection, the probability that malaria was responsible for this selection was further supported by micro-epidemiological data from Italy and the Pacific. In a series of classic studies conducted in the 1960s, a cline (or gradient) in the population frequencies of beta thalassemia in Sardinia correlated with altitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Although malaria was no longer endemic in Sardinia when these studies were conducted, historically, the incidence of malaria was known to have correlated closely with altitude. The favored hypothesis was that the cline represented selection for the thalassemic beta globin gene under pressure from malaria.</p><p>Support for this hypothesis has since come from the Pacific. While the gene frequency for beta thalassemia followed a similar correlation with altitude in Papua New Guinea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>], it was the data for alpha thalassemia collected from communities throughout Melanesia that was perhaps the more dramatic. These data showed that alpha thalassemia was found in all malaria-exposed populations and at gene frequencies that were proportional to the incidence of malaria based on historical reports.</p><p>A cline in the alpha thalassemia haplotype frequency was seen both from north to south and with increasing altitude, each of which are paralleled by a cline in the historical incidence of malaria. In addition, the genetic deletions responsible were numerous and regionally specific. Further, population frequencies of other &quot;neutral&quot; genetic markers, including the gamma globin haplotypes, showed no such correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>].

There was an increasing frequency of thalassemia trait with increasing age, suggesting that carriers had increased survival.

Using a parasite density of &ge;1 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> to indicate a potentially lethal infection, the relative risk was 0.45 in children between the ages of one and four with beta thalassemia trait when compared with those without thalassemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both diminished parasite growth and altered function of infected red blood cells may contribute to the protection against malaria in beta thalassemia. In initially-performed culture studies, parasites grew normally in thalassemia trait red cells, but parasites were more susceptible to oxidants than were parasites growing in normal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. However, the inability to demonstrate impaired parasite growth in this and other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>] may have been due to the use of culture media with an abundance of amino acids essential for parasite growth that are usually obtained by the digestion of hemoglobin by malarial hemoglobinases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Such an abundance of amino acids in the culture media would mask the limitations encountered by the parasite in the hypochromic (ie, hemoglobin deficient) red cells of subjects with thalassemia.</p><p>The impairment in parasite growth that has been demonstrated in other studies varies with the type of thalassemic erythrocyte.

In PNG, compared with controls, the risk of severe malaria was 0.40 (95% CI 0.22-0.74) in alpha thalassemia homozygotes and 0.66 (95% CI 0.37-1.20) in heterozygotes. Moreover, the risk of hospital admission with infections other than malaria was reduced to a similar degree in homozygous (0.36; 95% CI 0.22-0.60) and heterozygous (0.63; 95% CI 0.38-1.07) children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p>Ghanaian children with alpha thalassemia were protected from severe malaria; heterozygous alpha thalassemia was observed in 32.6 percent of controls but in only 26.2 percent of cases (odds ratio [OR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].

No associations were found between alpha thalassemia and the prevalence of symptomless <em>P. falciparum</em> parasitemia, the incidence of mild malaria, or parasite densities during malaria episodes. However, the presence of alpha thalassemia showed protection from severe malarial anemia and severe nonmalarial anemia. The incidence rate ratios for alpha thalassemia heterozygotes and homozygotes combined compared with Hb AA children were 0.33 (95% CI 0.15-0.73) for severe malaria anemia and 0.26 (95% CI 0.09-0.77) for severe nonmalarial anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The protection against severe malaria associated with alpha thalassemia may be mediated in part by increased susceptibility to infection with the nonlethal <em>P. vivax</em>, particularly in young children, thereby inducing limited cross-species protection against subsequent severe <em>P. falciparum</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/112,121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">112,121,122</a>].

Such an extrinsic mechanism cannot be detected in culture.</p><p>Reduced expression of red cell complement receptor 1 (CR1), responsible for red cell rosetting of infected and non-infected red cells, has been associated with alpha thalassemia and may confer protection against severe malaria via this mechanism.

However, one study uncovered a significant epistatic interaction between alpha thalassemia and Hp genotype that may explain why studies that do not examine both genotypes could give conflicting results. Whereas Hp2-1 inherited in combination with alpha<sup>+</sup> thalassemia offered significant (37 percent) protection against severe malaria, such protection was considerably reduced (13 percent protection) when inherited in combination with a normal alpha globin genotype. Moreover, in those with alpha thalassemia, protection was lost altogether when inherited in combination with Hp2-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. Indeed, there was a non-significant trend towards increased susceptibility in those who inherited Hp2-2 and alpha thalassemia. The available data suggest that complex epistatic interactions arise from the fact that the Hp2-2 molecule is significantly less able to quench hemoglobin-iron mediated oxidative stress, and is further associated with a shift towards a pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine response. The available data suggest that Hp2-1, but not Hp1-1 or Hp2-2, confers a selective advantage through protection from malaria but only in the presence of alpha thalassemia.
