Different conditions can cause problems with the knee joint. One of the most common causes is osteoarthritis, a type of arthritis that often comes with age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F115065\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115065 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Knee replacement is a treatment that can reduce knee pain and improve the way the knee works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717214\"><span class=\"h1\">When are knee problems treated with knee replacement?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knee problems might or might not be treated with knee replacement right away. Doctors often suggest trying other treatments first. These can include weight loss, medicines, knee braces, or physical therapy. If these treatments do not help enough, doctors then suggest knee replacement.</p><p>One reason doctors suggest trying other treatments first, especially for younger people, is that a replacement knee joint can wear out over time. Knee replacements usually last at least 10 to 15 years, and some last longer. The number of years a replacement joint lasts depends on different things, such as how active the person is.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717221\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during knee replacement surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knee replacement takes place in an operating room in a hospital. A doctor will give you medicines to make you sleep and to numb your body. Then your doctor will make a cut down the center on the front of the knee. He or she will replace parts of your knee joint with man-made parts made out of metal, ceramic, or plastic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F93761\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93761 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717228\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgery, most people stay in the hospital for 2 to 4 days. While you are in the hospital, you will get:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat your pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic medicines to prevent infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to prevent blood clots in the legs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special boots or stockings to prevent blood clots in the legs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy &ndash; Most people are able to stand and walk (with help) within a day after surgery. The physical therapist will teach you exercises to make the muscles in your leg stronger. He or she will also work with you on bending, walking, and climbing stairs so that you can move normally.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717235\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can people have from knee replacement?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People can have different problems right after knee replacement surgery, but serious problems are uncommon. Problems from knee replacement can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots in the legs &ndash; This can cause leg pain and swelling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections &ndash; Symptoms of an infection can include fever, chills, pain in the knee that gets worse and worse, or knee swelling.</p><p/><p>If you have any of these symptoms, let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p>People who have a knee replaced sometimes find that the new knee is stiff and does not bend as well as their own knee used to. This can make it hard to climb stairs or get up from a low chair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717242\"><span class=\"h1\">Where do I go after I leave the hospital?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people go home. But some people stay in a nursing home or rehabilitation center for a short time in order to get stronger before going home. Wherever you go, you will need to do your exercises and have physical therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717249\"><span class=\"h1\">When will I be able to do my usual activities again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people can do their usual activities again within 4 to 6 weeks of knee replacement. Your doctor or nurse will tell you if there are any activities that you should avoid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717256\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if knee replacement is right for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help you decide if knee replacement is right for you, talk with your doctor or nurse. You can ask him or her:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of knee replacement?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to knee replacement?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides knee replacement?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have knee replacement?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1717263\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-blood-clots-in-the-legs-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in the legs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-knee-replacement-arthroplasty-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Total knee replacement (arthroplasty) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Knee pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Joint infection (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
