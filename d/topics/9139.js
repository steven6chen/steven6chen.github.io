Fasting laboratory values obtained five days ago in anticipation of this office visit are as follows: glucose 389 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (21.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and creatinine 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> sodium 142 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> potassium 6.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> chloride 107 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and bicarbonate 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L;</span> glycated hemoglobin (A1C) 8.8 percent; hematocrit 34.4 percent. The sample is not hemolyzed. The urinalysis reveals 2+ protein, as in the past, when a 24-hour urine collection contained 771 mg of protein. A repeat serum potassium level was 5.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> yesterday. A blood glucose value in the office by fingerstick is 401 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dl</span> (22.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p>The patient lives in Italy and travels to the United States every year to see her family. In Italy she sees a local clinician. Although you send a copy of your office notes with the patient when she returns to Italy each year, the patient's medications are usually different when she returns.</p><p>The patient's glucose diary contains only occasional entries. The fasting blood glucose values in Italy were usually 140 to 170 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.77 to 9.44 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Since her arrival in the United States three weeks ago, the fasting blood glucose values have been in the 251 to 411 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 to 22.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> range. Values before supper in Italy were usually in the low 200s; since her return to the United States, they have been in the mid to high 300s. She complains of a dry mouth and nocturia two to three times a night. An electrocardiogram shows nonspecific ST and T wave changes. The T waves are not peaked, and the QRS interval is not prolonged.</p><p>She has a 23-year history of type 2 diabetes with persistently elevated A1C values in the 8.8 to 10.4 percent range complicated by retinopathy, nephropathy with proteinuria, and distal sensory neuropathy. She has enteropathy with episodes of recurrent severe constipation and abdominal pain over the last eight years treated with enemas, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a>, intermittent oral phosphosoda (in the past), and intermittent Miralax (polyethylene glycol) more recently. The patient has a three-year history of anemia, previously treated with transfusions of packed red blood cells, but now treated with Aranesp (darbepoetin alpha). She has hypertension and mixed hyperlipidemia. Her lipid disorder is treated with medical nutrition therapy, efforts to achieve metabolic control of the diabetes, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a>. One year ago a renal duplex ultrasound revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis or hydronephrosis.</p><p>On examination, the patient is in no acute distress. Blood pressure is <span class=\"nowrap\">150/70</span> mmHg supine, <span class=\"nowrap\">160/80</span> mmHg upright, heart rate 78 bpm regular, weight 161 lbs, height 5' 1&quot;, body mass index (BMI) 30.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. Her fundi are obscured by central cataracts. The chest exam is clear to percussion and auscultation. The cardiovascular exam reveals no increase in jugular venous pressure, a normal S1, and a single S2. There is no murmur, rub, gallop, or heave. The abdominal exam reveals a well-healed, right upper quadrant cholecystectomy scar and no palpable liver, spleen, kidney, or mass. There is no distension or tenderness. Neurologic examination shows reduced sensation to light touch to the knees, absent vibratory sensation at the great toes and medial malleoli, and absent knee and ankle jerks. Peripheral pulses are intact.</p><p>Her medications are as follows: NPH insulin 32 units before breakfast and 32 units before supper, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> 25 mg daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> 40 mg every evening, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 81 mg daily, Aranesp 25 micrograms subcutaneously every two weeks, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=senna-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">senna</a> tablets 2 every evening, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> syrup 1 to 2 teaspoons at night periodically. The patient had previously been on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a>, which had been stopped because of mild hyperkalemia, in the 5.2 to 5.4 range.</p><p>What is your assessment and plan?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You conclude that the patient has hyperglycemia-induced hyperkalemia in the setting of renal insufficiency. You attribute the renal dysfunction to diabetic nephropathy in a patient with proteinuria and retinopathy, and note that the patient also has erythropoietin deficiency, probably on the same basis. You decide that hypertension may also contribute.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">You review the patient's diet, with emphasis on the intake of potassium and provide a printout of a low potassium diet. She notes a high intake of tomatoes but says she cannot live without tomatoes in her diet. You advise her to reduce the quantity of tomatoes by at least half. You refer the patient to a registered dietitian for further discussion of a low potassium diet.

You decide that hypertension may also contribute.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">You review the patient's diet. She acknowledges that she has been eating much larger portions of carbohydrates such as pasta and bread since her return to the United States. She notes a high intake of tomatoes but says she cannot live without tomatoes in her diet. You advise her to reduce the quantity of tomatoes by at least half. You also instruct her to reduce portions of the pasta and bread to the quantities she consumed in Italy but not to eliminate these items from her diet. You emphasize the need to reduce the intake of potassium and provide a printout of a low potassium diet. You refer the patient to a registered dietitian for medical nutrition therapy of diabetes and for further discussion of a low potassium diet. You ask your nurse to give the patient 8 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a>. You increase the morning dose of NPH insulin to 40 units and the pre-supper dose of NPH insulin to 35 units.

You refer her to a nephrologist.

You prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a> 0.1 mg by mouth daily as a mineralocorticoid replacement therapy for the aldosterone deficiency.
