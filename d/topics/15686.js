In shoulder dystocia, the baby's shoulder gets stuck behind the mother's pelvic bone as the baby moves down the birth canal to the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59831 \">figure 2</a>). This causes the baby to get stuck in the birth canal.</p><p>Shoulder dystocia is an emergency that needs to be treated quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281370396\"><span class=\"h1\">Do doctors and midwives know when shoulder dystocia is going to happen?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not usually. But they do know that shoulder dystocia is more likely to happen when a baby is much bigger than normal. Women with diabetes and women who are overweight are more likely to have big babies. It's also more likely to happen in women who had a baby with shoulder dystocia before.</p><p>But most times, shoulder dystocia happens for unknown reasons. Because of this, there is no good way to always prevent it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281370411\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of shoulder dystocia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shoulder dystocia causes no symptoms in the mother. During delivery, the doctor or midwife sees that the baby's shoulders aren't coming out of the vagina as expected after the baby's head comes out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281370426\"><span class=\"h1\">How is shoulder dystocia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As soon as your doctor or midwife sees that there is shoulder dystocia, he or she will have you stop pushing for a while. Then he or she will try different things to help deliver the baby. He or she might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Move your thighs onto your belly to make more room for the baby</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reach into your vagina to help get the baby unstuck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Press on your belly to push down on the baby's shoulders and get them unstuck</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281370441\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen from shoulder dystocia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shoulder dystocia can cause problems in both the baby and the mother.</p><p>The most common problems that can happen in a baby are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A broken arm or collarbone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve damage &ndash; If the baby's neck gets stretched too much, the nerves around the shoulder can get damaged. This can cause weakness of the arm and trouble moving the arm. Doctors sometimes use the term &quot;Erb's palsy&quot; for this type of injury.</p><p/><p>The most common problem that can happen in the mother is bleeding from tears in the tissues around the vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281370482\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I had a baby with shoulder dystocia before and am pregnant again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or midwife will talk with you about the chances of shoulder dystocia happening again. He or she might recommend that you have a C-section to deliver your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281370497\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labor-and-delivery-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Labor and delivery (childbirth) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-baby-is-overdue-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your baby is overdue (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-injuries-from-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Maternal injuries from childbirth (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-appearance-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Newborn appearance (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=postterm-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Postterm pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
