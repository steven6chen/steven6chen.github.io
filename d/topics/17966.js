Patients with a preexcitation syndrome have an additional pathway, known as an accessory pathway, which directly connects the atria and ventricles, bypassing the AV node. Normal conduction through the AV node is slower than conduction over the accessory pathway. Thus, when there is conduction over an accessory pathway, the ventricles are activated earlier than if the impulse had traveled through the AV node. This early activation, referred to as <strong>preexcitation</strong>, is responsible for the classic electrocardiographic (ECG) findings of a shortened PR interval and, in most patients, a delta wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67181\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67181 \">waveform 1</a>). </p><p>Symptoms, ranging from mild palpitations to syncope and, rarely, even sudden cardiac death, are the result of tachycardia, usually due to a macroreentrant circuit involving the AV node, the ventricles, the accessory pathway, and the atria. This classic supraventricular tachycardia associated with WPW syndrome is called AV reentrant or reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT). However, preexcited atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response may also result in symptoms. Fortunately, the incidence of sudden death in patients with the WPW syndrome is quite low, ranging from 0 to 0.39 percent annually in several large case series, with the lowest risk seen in asymptomatic patients. </p><p>Patients with the WPW syndrome are usually treated because of symptomatic arrhythmias. Treatment may sometimes be extended to asymptomatic patients with a WPW pattern if certain &quot;high-risk&quot; features are present. However, most asymptomatic patients with the WPW electrocardiographic pattern are not treated. Treatment options for persons with arrhythmias and the WPW syndrome include nonpharmacologic therapies (ie, catheter ablation of the accessory pathway) as well as pharmacologic therapy (to slow ventricular heart rates or to prevent arrhythmias). The choice of the optimal therapy depends on the acuity of the arrhythmia(s) and the risk of sudden cardiac death, with pharmacologic agents being the treatment of choice for most acute arrhythmias, while catheter ablation is nearly always preferred for the long-term prevention of recurrent arrhythmias involving the accessory pathway. </p><p>This topic will review the available therapeutic options for the treatment of arrhythmias in the WPW syndrome. The clinical manifestations, approach to diagnosis, and the types of arrhythmias which can occur in persons with an accessory pathway and the WPW pattern are discussed separately.

However, because of the electrophysiologic differences between AV nodal tissue and tissue comprising an accessory pathway, standard therapy for heart rate control may actually worsen symptoms and lead to clinical deterioration in patients with a tachycardia involving an accessory pathway. Knowledge of the presence of an accessory pathway is critical in choosing the correct initial pharmacologic therapy.

Patients who are hemodynamically stable can be evaluated and treated according to the type of suspected arrhythmia. However, patients with hemodynamic instability or compromise related to an ongoing tachycardia should undergo urgent electrical cardioversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-symptomatic-arrhythmias-associated-with-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In such patients, antegrade conduction across the AV node is typically the &quot;weak link&quot; of the reentrant circuit. Thus, the approach to patients with orthodromic AVRT is similar to patients with other types of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, where relatively specific therapies that lengthen AV nodal refractoriness and depress its conduction can block the impulse within the AV node and terminate and prevent the tachycardia.

The drug is administered by rapid intravenous injection over one to two seconds at a peripheral site, followed by a 10 cc normal saline flush.
