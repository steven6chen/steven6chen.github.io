However, they are potentially very serious. Suppurative cervical lymphadenitis is the most common superficial neck infection. Deep neck infections include peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, and lateral pharyngeal space infection (also known as pharyngomaxillary or parapharyngeal space infection). Lateral pharyngeal space infection most often arises via contiguous spread of infection from a peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess.</p><p>The clinical features, evaluation, and management of retropharyngeal cellulitis and abscess in children will be discussed here. Cervical lymphadenitis, peritonsillar cellulitis and abscess, and other deep neck space infections are discussed separately.

The anterior boundary is the middle layer of the deep cervical fascia (abutting the posterior esophageal wall). The posterior boundary is the deep layer of the deep cervical fascia. These fascia fuse inferiorly at the level between the first and second thoracic vertebrae. The retropharyngeal space communicates with the lateral pharyngeal space. The lateral pharyngeal space is bounded laterally by the carotid sheath, which contains the carotid artery and jugular vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retropharyngeal-infections-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The &quot;danger&quot; space lies behind the anatomic retropharyngeal space. It&nbsp;is a potential space that provides a path for retropharyngeal infections to extend into the mediastinum. </p><p>The retropharyngeal space contains two chains of lymph nodes that are prominent in the young child, but atrophy before puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retropharyngeal-infections-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. These lymph nodes drain the nasopharynx, adenoids, posterior paranasal sinuses, middle ear, and eustachian tube. Infections in these areas may lead to suppurative adenitis of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retropharyngeal-infections-in-children/abstract/1,2,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,6</a>].

Proper technique is critical to appropriate interpretation because false-positive studies are common in children.

False thickening of the retropharyngeal space also may be caused by crying, particularly in infants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When retropharyngeal infection (cellulitis or abscess) is present, the prevertebral space is increased in depth compared with the anteroposterior measurement of the adjacent vertebral body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63233\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63233 \">image 1</a>). In an infant or child younger than 5 years of age, the retropharyngeal space normally measures one-half the width of the adjacent vertebral body and is considered widened if it is greater than a full vertebral body at C2 or 3 when the spine is properly extended. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternatively, the retropharyngeal space is considered pathologically widened if it is greater than 7 mm at C2 or 14 mm at C6 in children and 22 mm at C6 in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retropharyngeal-infections-in-children/abstract/2,5,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,27</a>]. Additional features suggestive of retropharyngeal infection include loss or reversal of the normal cervical lordosis due to muscle spasm or local inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retropharyngeal-infections-in-children/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>].

Additional CT findings that are common to retropharyngeal abscess and cellulitis include low-density core, soft-tissue swelling, obliterated fat planes, and mass effect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51505\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51505 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although CT is the test of choice, it is not a perfect test, and clinical judgment must be the ultimate determinant of management. The sensitivity and specificity of CT in predicting purulent material at surgery vary from study to study (ranging from 64 to 100 percent for sensitivity and 45 to 82 percent for specificity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retropharyngeal-infections-in-children/abstract/6,32-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,32-38</a>]. These figures must be interpreted with caution because the gold standard test (identification of purulent fluid at surgery) may not always have been performed on the same day as the CT scan and the clinical course may progress between the two. CT and surgical findings might be more closely correlated if surgery was performed soon after the CT was obtained.
