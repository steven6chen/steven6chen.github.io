Anatomic location and type of stoma construction have an impact on management. Loop colostomies tend to be larger and somewhat more difficult to manage than end colostomies. The type and volume of output (effluent), and therefore fluid loss, is determined by the location of the stoma relative to the ileocecal valve. Fluid loss is primarily a factor with end or loop ileostomies.</p><p>With proper stoma care and attention to nutrition and fluid management, most ostomy patients are able to have full, healthy, active social and professional lives, and normal sexual activity. In many cases, quality of life can be improved, even in the context of a permanent ostomy, with treatment of the underlying disease.</p><p>The routine care and management of common issues and complications of stoma creation are reviewed here. The types and indications, and principles of ostomy construction and reversal are discussed separately.

Because the small bowel effluent is rich in proteolytic enzymes, the patient with an ileostomy must exercise particular caution in managing the peristomal skin. These patients should routinely use barrier wafers, rings, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paste to assure that their skin is not exposed to the drainage and must treat any minor skin damage aggressively to prevent progression. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60242511\"><span class=\"h2\">Pouch emptying and care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Odor and gas are common concerns for any individual with an ostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The patient should be assured that ostomy pouches are odor proof, but when the pouch is emptied, odor is normal. Simple strategies can help reduce odor. These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emptying the pouch when it is approximately one-third full will prevent disruption of the pouch seal from excess weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changing the pouch one to two times weekly, and as needed, for any signs of leakage, or for <span class=\"nowrap\">itching/burning</span> of the peristomal skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping the tail of the pouch clean so that it does not become a source of odor.

Ileostomies, cecostomies, and ascending colostomies typically produce output (effluent) &gt;500 mL per day that contains digestive enzymes, which is irritating to the mucosa and skin, while <span class=\"nowrap\">descending/sigmoid</span> colostomies produce stool that is formed and does not contain digestive enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>]. The various types of ostomies are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-ostomy-for-fecal-diversion#H60234724\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical ostomy for fecal diversion&quot;, section on 'Fecal diversions'</a>.)</p><p>Strategies to control gas include measures to reduce the volume of gas produced or affect the &quot;timing&quot; of flatulence, &quot;muffling&quot; measures, and &quot;venting&quot; strategies. Dietary modifications and over the counter gas reducing agents help reduce the volume of gas. &quot;Muffling&quot; measures include layers of clothing and light pressure exerted against the stoma with the hand or arm when flatulence is anticipated. For patients with large volumes of gas, there are pouching systems with filters, which vent and deodorize flatus; there are also &quot;add-on&quot; flatus filters that can be used with any pouching system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Many patients assume that they will have to adhere to a special diet because of their ostomy. Dietary modifications are usually minimal, but specific foods can influence the amount of the gas and the consistency and odor of the effluent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. Patients should be given a general list of gas-producing foods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64218 \">table 1</a>). The carbohydrate raffinose is poorly digested and leads to gas production by the action of colonic bacteria. Common foods containing raffinose include beans, cabbage, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, broccoli, and asparagus. Starch and soluble fiber are other forms of carbohydrates that can contribute to gas formation. Potatoes, corn, noodles, and wheat produce gas while rice does not. Soluble fiber (found in oat bran, peas and other legumes, beans, and most fruit) also causes gas. In addition to dietary guidelines, patients should be informed about safe and effective over-the-counter agents that can be used for gas reduction, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simethicone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simethicone</a> containing products (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beano-alpha-galactosidase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Beano</a> and Gas-X). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gas-and-bloating-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Gas and bloating (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients should also be given an explanation that the usual &quot;lag time&quot; between ingestion of a gas-producing food and actual flatulence is between two and four hours for ileostomy and six to eight hours for distal colostomy. In addition to dietary modifications, ileostomy patients should be taught to avoid drinking through straws, chewing gum, and smoking, since these measures tend to increase gas ingestion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412494750\"><span class=\"h1\">ILEOSTOMY PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ileostomy patients and patients with ascending colostomies should be taught the importance of adequate daily fluid intake. A loop ileostomy performed in conjunction with a pelvic pouch procedure is located more proximally in the ileum and is associated with even more fluid and enzymatic output. Proximal ileostomy may also result in improper absorption of certain vitamins, minerals, and electrolytes. The patient with an ileostomy must be taught to avoid time-released and enteric-coated medications as well as very large tablets, since these forms of medication are likely to be incompletely absorbed. They must also avoid laxatives due to the risk for acute dehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Average output for the ileostomy patient ranges from 500 mL to 1300 mL a day; during the early postoperative period and episodes of gastroenteritis, daily output can be 1800 mL or even higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Ileostomy effluent contains significant amounts of sodium and potassium. This daily fluid loss places the ileostomy patient at greater risk for dehydration, especially during episodes of increased output or heavy perspiration. </p><p>Patients should be instructed to increase their daily fluid intake by at least 500 to 750 mL, and to drink even more during periods of high-volume output or heavy sweating. Preferred fluids include water, broth, vegetable juices, and some sports drinks, but patients should be advised that certain sports drinks may not be absorbed and may even exacerbate stoma output and dehydration. The use of pediatric electrolyte solutions (eg, PediaLyte, Emergen-C) is preferable to the use of sports drinks. </p><p>Patients should also be taught the signs and symptoms of fluid-electrolyte imbalance and the importance of prompt treatment should these symptoms occur. These include dry mouth, reduced urine output, dark concentrated urine, feelings of dizziness upon standing, marked fatigue, and abdominal cramping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>New protocols and pathways have been proposed to minimize dehydration and readmission in patients with new ileostomies. Using combinations of preoperative teaching, in-hospital engagement of the nurses and Wound, Ostomy and Continence care (WOCN) teams, in-hospital involvement and encouragement of patients and families in stoma care, postdischarge counseling, and tracking of intake and output have effectively reduced hospital readmission while maintaining an appropriate hospital length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Ileostomy patients should also be taught strategies to prevent food blockage proximal to the ostomy site, which can occur because the ileal lumen is &lt;1 inch in diameter. There is also the potential for further narrowing at the point where the bowel passes through the <span class=\"nowrap\">fascia/muscle</span> layer. If the patient consumes large amounts of insoluble fiber, the undigested fiber may create an obstructing mass (bezoar). Common &quot;offenders&quot; include popcorn, coconut, mushrooms, black olives, stringy vegetables, foods with skins, dried fruits, and meats with casings. </p><p>Food blockage is easily prevented by instructing the patient to consume potential offenders one at a time in small amounts, to chew thoroughly, and to monitor their response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>].</p><p>First-line management of patients with elevated ileostomy output should include soluble fiber supplementation (eg, Metamucil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a>, Konsyl, FiberCon, Fiber Gummies). Patients may slowly increase supplementation up to four times daily and also at double doses. </p><p>Medical management of patients with inappropriately-elevated ileostomy outputs include antimotility agents (eg, Imodium, Lomotil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>, and, rarely, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tincture-of-opium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tincture of Opium</a>). In all cases, adjustments should be made slowly and not in combination, as this could lead to a paralytic ileus or an obstructive pattern. Patients with persistent, recurrent, or difficult-to-manage complications from loop ileostomy creation should be considered for early reversal of the stoma and restoration of intestinal continuity, when feasible. Occasionally, patients may require intravenous fluid hydration as outpatients to compensate for the fluid losses. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412494960\"><span class=\"h1\">COLOSTOMY PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colostomy patients can be reassured that there are no absolute dietary restrictions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, they should be encouraged to ingest sufficient fiber and fluids to prevent constipation and should also be counseled regarding gas-producing foods and lag time. (See <a href=\"#H412495023\" class=\"local\">'Diet and control of gas'</a> above.)</p><p>The patient should also be informed that intermittent mucoid discharge is normal with ostomies that have a defunctionalized distal limb either from the distal ostomy site (mucus fistula), or from the anus.</p><p>Patients should be taught to prevent constipation by maintaining appropriate fiber and fluid intake. If constipation does occur, it can be managed with laxatives or irrigation. (See <a href=\"#H412495215\" class=\"local\">'Colon irrigation'</a> below.)</p><p>For severe constipation, digital disimpaction may be necessary, but should generally be performed only by an experienced <span class=\"nowrap\">physician/surgeon</span> or ostomy nurse. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412495215\"><span class=\"h2\">Colon irrigation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine irrigation is appropriate <strong>only</strong> for patients with distal colostomies and is not effective for all patients. Irrigation involves instillation of 500 to 1500 mL of tap water into the descending or sigmoid colon ostomy on a routine schedule (usually daily or every other day); the resulting bowel distention stimulates peristaltic activity, which causes the distal colon to empty. </p><p>Patients who had fairly normal bowel elimination patterns preoperatively can usually achieve complete evacuation of the colon with irrigation, which provides them with a &quot;stool-free&quot; interval of approximately 24 hours. Most patients who manage their colostomies with routine irrigation are essentially continent and need to wear only a small pouch or &quot;cap&quot; for collection of mucous and deodorization of flatus. Patients who manage effectively with routine irrigation report a higher quality of life than patients who manage with pouching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/5,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18-20</a>]. Some have raised concerns that routine irrigation could result in bowel dependence, but colonic distention is a normal physiologic stimulus to effect evacuation and no studies or data have indicated any adverse effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common concern for many patients is the impact of the stoma on activities of daily living. The patient can be reassured that most activities can be safely resumed with minimal, if any, modifications. As an example, bathing and showering can be performed with the pouch on or off, and clothing modifications are generally not required. Most sports activities can be resumed as well, with the exception of extreme contact sports, which could potentially damage the stoma. The addition of a belt or binder is helpful in maintaining a pouch seal during vigorous activity and with perspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual activity is a particular concern for many patients with an ostomy. Patient counseling should address questions regarding sexual activity and partner response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The ostomy does not affect organic sexual function. However, if the ostomy was placed due to some form of pelvic surgery or prior radiation treatment, it is possible that the autonomic nerves controlling sexual function, which are located adjacent the rectum and the pelvic sidewall, may have been injured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of male sexual dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is helpful for the patient to empty the pouch and assure an intact pouch seal before engaging in sexual activity.

Manual reduction should be initiated at the very tip of the prolapse (beehive) or lumen, and then gentle, slow invagination should proceed. In this way, the prolapsed bowel will intussuscept back into the abdomen. </p><p>Complicated prolapse or prolapse producing ischemic changes or severe mucosal irritation and bleeding usually requires surgical intervention. Local revision of the prolapse is accomplished by performing a full-thickness resection of the prolapsed intestinal segment with construction of the stoma at the original site.

Early stenosis of ileostomy, due to edema at the fascial and more superficial levels (assuming appropriate skin opening) can be conservatively managed with gentle insertion of a large 36 French soft-tipped Foley bladder catheter just proximal to the fascial level. The balloon should not be inflated. Care must be taken to avoid perforation. Stenosis can occur later at the skin or the fascia level, or stoma outlet secondary due to scarring or tightness of the mucocutaneous junction. Stenosis may be attributable to peristomal sepsis, retraction, an ill-fitting pouching system, or suboptimal surgical technique. The patient should be evaluated for other processes that could contribute (eg, Crohn disease, primary or recurrent malignancy).</p><p>Mild stenosis may be identified only by digital examination of the stoma, with few symptoms, and can usually be managed by dietary modifications (eg, avoidance of insoluble fiber); gentle routine dilatation of the stoma may also be helpful but is not evidence based. Clinically significant stenosis usually causes cramping pain followed by explosive output, and usually requires surgical correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/routine-care-of-patients-with-an-ileostomy-or-colostomy-and-management-of-ostomy-complications/abstract/6,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,31</a>]. </p><p>Local revision may be preferred over dilation, which can be complicated by peristomal bleeding, tissue injury, fibrosis, and further stenosis. Local repair involves excision of scar tissue with adequate mobilization and creation of a new tension-free stoma at a new or relocated site.
