The presenting symptoms are similar to those of menopause. The condition was previously referred to as &quot;premature menopause&quot; and &quot;premature ovarian failure.&quot; The age-specific incidence of spontaneous POI is approximately 1 in 250 by age 35 years and 1 in 100 by age 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In its fully developed form, it is associated with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, symptoms of estrogen deficiency, and gonadotropin levels in the menopausal range before age 40 years.</p><p>The management of women with spontaneous POI will be reviewed here. Turner syndrome (45,X0 or other Xp chromosome abnormalities) and autoimmune POI, as well as other aspects of spontaneous (46,XX) POI, are reviewed separately.

The most common words women use to describe their emotional state in the immediate hours after receiving the diagnosis are &quot;devastated,&quot; &quot;shocked,&quot; and &quot;confused&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Young women with POI are usually unprepared for the diagnosis, and the majority are unhappy with the manner in which they were informed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In one study of 100 women with POI, 71 percent were dissatisfied with how they were informed of their diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Specific areas of improvement suggested by women in the study included the need for clinicians to spend more time with the patient and provide more information about this condition.</p><p>It is best to schedule a return office visit to review the laboratory results when the diagnosis is suspected. Clinicians should inform patients that 50 to 75 percent of women with 46,XX spontaneous POI experience intermittent ovarian function and that 5 to 10 percent of women are able to become pregnant sometime after the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

At this point, it is helpful to stress the importance of first addressing other aspects of POI that may have adverse effects on their long-term health, such as emotional health, autoimmune endocrinopathies, and osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure#H3189178\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of POI brings with it the potential for development of related depression and anxiety disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. POI also has potential long-term sequelae, which are largely related to the associated endocrine deficiencies.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure#H897793056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;, section on 'Consequences of estrogen deficiency'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1222519042\"><span class=\"h2\">Estrogen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unless there is an absolute contraindication to taking estrogen therapy, women with POI should receive estrogen therapy to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and urogenital atrophy and to maintain sexual health and quality of life. Our approach is consistent with The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee Opinion on hormone therapy in POI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although exogenous estrogen replacement is recommended, only limited data are available about the advantages or disadvantages of different hormone regimens or about estrogen's efficacy for cardiovascular disease prevention.

Estradiol (17-beta-estradiol) and micronized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> are bioidentical hormones, eg, they have the same molecular structure as the estradiol and progesterone produced by the ovary (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparations-for-menopausal-hormone-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparations for menopausal hormone therapy&quot;</a>).

This dose is also roughly equivalent to 2 mg daily of oral micronized estradiol. This dose is higher than what is used for postmenopausal women and is based upon the average daily production of estradiol by the premenopausal ovary.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1039633676\"><span class=\"h4\">Route of estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transdermal or vaginal delivery of estrogen are more physiologic approaches; other potential advantages of these routes over oral estrogen, such as lower risks of venous thromboembolism and gallbladder disease, are reviewed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The advantages related to vascular safety are more important in older, postmenopausal women (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-menopausal-symptoms-with-hormone-therapy#H2910483906\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of menopausal symptoms with hormone therapy&quot;, section on 'Route'</a>). For women who do not like or do not tolerate transdermal or vaginal estradiol, oral estradiol is perfectly acceptable. We do not suggest routine monitoring of serum estradiol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. We suggest starting with suggested dosing above and titrating doses to alleviate symptoms or using the lowest dose to preserve bone density in patients who experience side effects.

Our first-line progestin is micronized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> (MP) 200 mg per day for the first 12 days of the month. Other clinicians prefer oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (MPA) (10 mg daily for 12 days per calendar month) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. Both progestin regimens are effective for improving bone mineral density. For MPA, data come from one trial in women with POI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and trials in postmenopausal women, and for MP, there is indirect evidence from multiple trials in postmenopausal women.

However, indirect evidence from trials in postmenopausal women suggest that there are a number of advantages to MP over MPA (no adverse effects on lipids or clotting factors), but this has not yet been studied in the POI population.

Of note, however, one small trial suggested that lower-dose, physiologic hormone therapy may be more beneficial for bone mineral density than higher-dose estrogen (an oral estrogen-progestin contraceptive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Standard postmenopausal hormone therapy, which has a much lower dose of estrogen than combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives, does <strong>not</strong> provide effective contraception. Since spontaneous ovarian activity may resume, some form of contraception may be required if the patient is not seeking pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H1222519065\" class=\"local\">'Contraception'</a> below.)</p><p>When estradiol-progestin hormone therapy is prescribed rather than contraceptive pills, a cyclic regimen that will induce regular monthly menses allows easier recognition of the 5 to 10 percent potential for a spontaneous and unexpected pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. We encourage our patients to keep a menstrual calendar. If they miss a menstrual period, they should obtain a pregnancy test and stop the estrogen and progestin therapy if the test result is positive.</p><p>These spontaneous pregnancies progress entirely normally in most cases, and there appears to be no need for exogenous hormone supplementation during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3248830661\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is abundant indirect evidence from postmenopausal women that hormone therapy would be effective for estrogen deficiency symptoms and bone health in women with POI. While observational data suggest that early natural menopause (prior to age 44, but not POI) is associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease, data on the role of hormone therapy for cardiovascular health in women with POI are lacking. That said, we agree with ACOG that women with POI should receive estrogen therapy unless there is an absolute contraindication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

They suggest hormonal contraception options for those in whom pregnancy prevention is a priority. (See <a href=\"#H1222519065\" class=\"local\">'Contraception'</a> below.)</p><p>Most patients are aware of the association between estrogen deficiency and osteoporosis, but they are also concerned about the potential risks of cardiovascular complications and breast cancer with long-term estrogen therapy that have been reported in older postmenopausal women (the Women's Health Initiative) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to stress to young women with POI that they differ from normally menopausal women in important ways with regard to the risk:benefit ratio of estradiol therapy. First, in the absence of estradiol replacement, they may be at greater risk for later coronary heart disease, overall mortality, cognitive decline, and dementia, presumably due to estradiol deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. As an example, two studies suggest that women with POI have significant vascular endothelial dysfunction, which is restored to normal by estrogen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>].</p><p>In addition, their baseline risks of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer are much lower than those for older, postmenopausal women, and therefore, the results of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) are probably not clinically important until they reach approximately age 50 years, the average age at natural menopause.</p><p>The issue of postmenopausal hormone therapy after age 50 years is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hormone-therapy-benefits-and-risks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hormone therapy: Benefits and risks&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956717\"><span class=\"h4\">Cancer survivors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with POI due to cytotoxic drugs or radiation therapy are often candidates for estradiol therapy. However, the decision to treat with estradiol depends upon the type of cancer (eg, estrogen is contraindicated in women with breast cancer, while estrogen is prescribed for women with Hodgkin lymphoma and ovarian insufficiency to preserve bone health and prevent cardiovascular disease). Like women with other causes of POI, the current approach is to continue estradiol until approximately age 50 years, the average age at natural menopause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1222512910\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women who are taking a full replacement dose of physiologic estradiol score within the normal range on a validated measure of sexual function.

As a group, however, compared with controls, women with 46,XX spontaneous POI score adversely with regard to sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

Women with POI may develop related depression and anxiety disorders.</p><p>As with any life-altering diagnosis, women with POI benefit from encouragement and support that helps them to regain a sense of control and confidence. The first step is to encourage a woman with POI and her partner, when they are ready, to express their emotions about the diagnosis and validate those feelings. A simple and effective entr&eacute;e into this discussion is: &quot;Many patients with POI tell us that this is a very difficult diagnosis to accept emotionally&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/5,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25</a>]. It is worth pointing out that coming to grips with emotions about this diagnosis is a gradual process and that the patient needs to give herself time and permission to work through these issues. Feelings of intense grief and loss for the biologic children they expected to have are normal for couples whose life plans included building a family. Discussions about the normal grieving process, the strains that the diagnosis might bring to their relationship, and the importance of open communication are also helpful.</p><p>Some young women mistakenly interpret the diagnosis of POI as an indication that they have become a menopausal woman who is &quot;growing old overnight&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Symptoms of estrogen deficiency such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness can be interpreted as signs of premature aging. It is important to clarify that this is not the case.</p><p>For women who experience significant anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> depression related to the diagnosis, we suggest seeing a therapist with expertise in POI. In some cases, ongoing individual or group counseling is helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H848294755\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of androgen replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest against the routine use of androgen therapy in women with POI. Although women with POI may have some degree of androgen deficiency when compared with young women without ovarian insufficiency, testosterone therapy has not been shown to be beneficial, and it is associated with important side effects.</p><p>In several studies of women with POI, serum ovarian androgen concentrations (androstenedione <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> testosterone) were lower than age-matched women without ovarian insufficiency, but similar to those seen in older postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In contrast, levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), an adrenal androgen, were normal (although they would be expected to be low in women with coexisting primary adrenal insufficiency).</p><p>The clinical consequences of this decrease in ovarian androgens and the possible role of androgen therapy in women with POI have not been extensively studied. However, available data suggest that testosterone therapy is not beneficial. In one trial, 128 women with 46,XX POI on estrogen-progestin therapy were randomly assigned to 12 months of transdermal testosterone (150 mcg patch) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In spite of a significant increase in mean serum total testosterone concentrations in the testosterone group compared with placebo (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> and 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> at 12 months, respectively), there were no differences in quality of life, self-esteem, or mood symptoms between the two groups. In a second study, the addition of testosterone to three years of estradiol-progestin therapy did not provide added benefit in bone mineral density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Potential side effects of androgen replacement include hirsutism and acne, and with oral preparations (eg, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]), dyslipidemia. We therefore suggest not using androgen replacement therapy in this population.
