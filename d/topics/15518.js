However, biologics can have unintended effects on immune function that can compromise host defenses and lead to serious infections. Other manifestations of immunosuppression, such as the development of autoimmune diseases or malignancies, may also occur with some of these therapies. Biologics that cause immunosuppression, either as the primary therapeutic goal or as an unintended side effect, and the immunologic mechanisms through which this occurs, will be reviewed here. This topic is not comprehensive. Only representative examples of biologics resulting in a consistent and marked impairment in immune function are discussed. In addition, many new biologics targeting the immune system are under development with varying degrees of infectious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-induced-by-biologic-therapies/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The management of drug-induced immunodeficiency may include regimens of prophylactic antibiotics or antivirals or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> for the treatment of hypogammaglobulinemia. These issues are discussed elsewhere in the program in relation to specific diseases, and links are provided throughout this topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447873552\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biologic therapies that can increase the risk of infectious diseases include antithymocyte globulin (ATG), monoclonal antibodies to T and B cells, anticytokine therapies, and agents that disrupt T cell costimulation signals. These agents selectively target cells and pathways of the immune system to achieve specific therapeutic effects and are used primarily in the treatment of rheumatic, inflammatory, and malignant diseases. An overview of the use of these agents in rheumatic disorders is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of biologic agents and kinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447873570\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors that increase the risk of infectious complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With any biologic agent, the likelihood of clinically significant infection primarily depends upon the actions of the drug in question, its dose, and the duration of treatment. In addition, there are other patient-specific factors that contribute to the risk. The most important are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nature of the underlying disease process &ndash; For example, a patient who is given an immunosuppressive drug shortly after undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for malignancy may be at greater risk than a patient receiving the same drug for chronic, stable rheumatologic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The functional status and medical fragility of the patient &ndash; Studies have shown that hospitalized patients, those with poor functional status or comorbid conditions, and older adults are more likely to develop immune complications when treated with glucocorticoids, and this is likely to be the case for other immunosuppressant drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-induced-by-biologic-therapies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The concomitant use of other immunosuppressive medications with synergistic adverse immunologic effects.</p><p/><p>The use of biologics to modulate the immune system has become a major therapeutic approach in the setting of inflammatory disorders. As with all therapeutics, there are untoward effects associated with these agents, and one of the most common is increased susceptibility to infection. The impact in terms of altering host defense and infectious susceptibility varies depending on the specific agent(s) used. In general, infections with common bacterial pathogens may become more frequent with agents targeting the B cell system, whereas intracellular pathogens, including opportunistic microbes, are often seen in treatment that is more focused on T cell immunity. It is important to recognize that use of biologics is also associated with additional adverse effects that often include an increased risk of developing a malignancy as well as others, but these are not the focus of this section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447873596\"><span class=\"h2\">Interventions to prevent infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whenever possible, the potential complications of these drugs should be considered in advance of their use.

Rituximab targets B cells from the pre-B cell stage to the preplasma cell stage via antibody-dependent cell-mediated lysis. The primary use of rituximab is in the treatment of B cell malignancies and in selected autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune cytopenias, autoimmune skin disease (pemphigus, pemphigoid), Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, and some forms of vasculitis. In certain forms of autoimmunity, a decrease in autoantibody levels has been observed following rituximab therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-induced-by-biologic-therapies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> depletes peripheral blood B cells, and subsequent normalization of B cell numbers typically requires six to nine months or longer.

These individuals had received rituximab therapy for periods ranging from one month to four years for a variety of disorders. The investigators also identified all patients treated with rituximab for any condition over a one-year period at four London hospitals to estimate the frequency of hypogammaglobulinemia.

BTK is a member of the src-related <span class=\"nowrap\">BTK/Tec</span> family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. Ibrutinib binds to and irreversibly inhibits BTK activity, thereby preventing both B cell activation and B cell-mediated signaling. This leads to an inhibition of the growth of malignant B cells that overexpress BTK. BTK is required for B cell receptor signaling, plays a key role in B cell maturation, and is overexpressed in a number of B cell malignancies. Ibrutinib is given orally for refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), other B cell malignancies, and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinemia have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-induced-by-biologic-therapies/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. It is usually given with other agents, notably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, so its effect on the immune system is not well-defined. However, side effects are generally mild.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H447875531\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biologic therapies that suppress immune function have the potential to cause serious unintended immunologic effects, such as an increased risk of infection or the development of malignant or autoimmune diseases. (See <a href=\"#H447873504\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biologic therapies with potentially significant immunologic complications include antithymocyte globulin (ATG), monoclonal antibodies to T and B cells, anticytokine therapies, and agents that disrupt T cell costimulation signals. The risk of immune complications is influenced by the specific agent used and its dose and duration, as well as patient-specific factors, such as the nature of the underlying disease, the patient's functional status and medical fragility, and the use of combinations of immunosuppressive agents. (See <a href=\"#H447873552\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ATG is used to deplete T cells in the peripheral blood and inhibit T and B cell interactions. Its use increases susceptibility to herpes virus, especially cytomegalovirus (CMV), and inhibits vaccine response if given before vaccination. (See <a href=\"#H447873656\" class=\"local\">'Antithymocyte globulin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofatumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofatumumab</a> are monoclonal antibodies to B cells that deplete peripheral blood B cells for a period of months. When possible, immunizations should be administered prior to rituximab therapy. Rituximab may cause hypogammaglobulinemia in a subset of patients, especially if given in multiple cycles. Although usually transient, this adverse effect can be persistent and clinically significant. Rituximab can also cause neutropenia. (See <a href=\"#H447873793\" class=\"local\">'Monoclonal antibodies to B cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monoclonal antibodies to T cells include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">basiliximab</a>. Alemtuzumab therapy can result in lymphopenia and neutropenia and a profound depletion of T and B cells for several months. Infectious complications of alemtuzumab therapy include bacteremia, sepsis, CMV, Pneumocystis, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Less is reported about basiliximab. (See <a href=\"#H447874606\" class=\"local\">'Monoclonal antibodies to T cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit B cell function include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> (anti-IL-6) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=belimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">belimumab</a> (anti-soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator [BlyS]). The risk of serious infections with these agents appears lower than that with drugs that suppress B cells more globally, and an increased risk of malignancy or autoimmunity has not been observed.

Abatacept has been used primarily in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and infectious complications in patients with rheumatoid arthritis appear to be less common than with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. Belatacept has been used mostly in renal transplantation and should not be given to patients who are EBV-seronegative and who received a transplant from an EBV-seropositive donor, or to recipients with unknown EBV status, because of the risk of EBV-associated posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).
