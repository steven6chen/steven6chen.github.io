Although there are data that suggest EPT infants with low BP (eg, perceived hypotension) are at an increased risk for adverse outcomes, low BP in EPT infants with <strong>adequate</strong> perfusion may not be an independent risk factor for poor outcome. Because data are insufficient regarding the efficacy and safety for antihypotensive therapy in adequately perfused EPT infants, it remains unclear how best to manage low BP in this group of patients. In contrast, the small minority (approximately 10 to 15 percent) of patients with both low BP and poor perfusion are in shock and require immediate attention to restore adequate perfusion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-shock#H2997754284\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of neonatal shock&quot;, section on 'Initial stabilization'</a>).</p><p>The challenges of BP management of EPT infants with good perfusion will be discussed here.

As a result, the BP management for EPT infants is based on limited observational data and varies amongst clinical centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3206285792\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiological changes in BP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a wide range of variability of BP values in EPT infants. Similar to more mature infants, BP for EPT infants increases with increasing birth weight (BW), gestational age (GA), and postnatal age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110236\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110236 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110237 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In addition, during the immediate postnatal period, there is a wide range of observed BP values for infants with the same GA and postnatal age. BP also increases by 4 to 5 mmHg per day in the first postnatal week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. As a result, these normal variations and expected rise in BP make it difficult to assess the impact of antihypotensive therapies on changes in BP values. So, if an antihypotensive therapy is administered and BP subsequently increases, it is not clear if the increase in BP is the result of the expected rise in BP after birth or due to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2574149072\"><span class=\"h2\">BP measurement reliability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In EPT infants, BP values can be obtained either from an indwelling umbilical arterial catheter (UAC) or a non-invasive BP cuff.

Mismanagement of BP due to inaccurate recording has been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>In EPT infants, noninvasive measurements are typically higher than values obtained from a UAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Normative BP data for EPT infants are based on measurements obtained from a UAC. These factors should be considered when comparing an individual infant's BP values against normative data and deciding whether antihypotensive therapy is indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1376202922\"><span class=\"h2\">Defining hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no widely accepted definition of hypotension in EPT infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Although multiple numeric cut-offs for defining low BP with clinical consequences have been considered, the wide range of observed BP values based on GA and postnatal age makes it challenging to determine whether a BP value for an individual EPT infant at a specific postnatal age is inappropriate (ie, too high, too low, rising too quickly, or not rising quickly enough) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. In our clinical practice, there is not a strict numerical threshold for defining hypotension. Antihypotensive therapy is considered for infants in whom a reliable BP trend is <strong>inconsistent</strong> with expected physiological changes, or when the infant develops clinical or laboratory evidence of poor perfusion. As a result, BP values are monitored frequently (either continuously through a UAC or hourly with a BP cuff) in conjunction with ongoing assessment of peripheral perfusion.</p><p>Our approach is based on the observation that most infants have at least one low BP value based on published normative data during the transitional time after delivery, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110236\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110236 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110237 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110007\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110007 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/5,6,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,14,16</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3206285792\" class=\"local\">'Physiological changes in BP'</a> above). In addition, BP values can be clinically significant even if they are not below a predetermined threshold, if they fail to rise normally, rise too quickly, or decrease over time. Conversely, numerically low BP values may be appropriate if they are rising at the expected rate of 4 to 5 mmHg per day in EPT infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/4,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16,17</a>].</p><p>The most commonly used definition for hypotension, a mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than the numerical equivalent of the infant's GA (in weeks), is not evidence-based [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Similar to other numeric cut-offs for hypotension, this definition is inconsistent with known physiological changes after delivery, leads to overtreatment of hypotension, and has not been associated with improved infant outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/1-5,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5,14-16</a>].

However, these studies should be interpreted with caution as they are observational in nature. As a result, potential confounding variables were not controlled. These include severity of illness and the presence of underlying diseases that can lead to both hypotension and death (eg, sepsis or hypovolemic shock).</p><p>The controversy regarding the impact of antihypotensive therapy is best illustrated by the following results from two large multicenter studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network multicenter study, 55 percent of EPT infants (n = 367) received at least one antihypotensive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-low-blood-pressure-in-extremely-preterm-infants/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Treated infants were more likely than untreated infants to develop severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), grade <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and morbidity-free survival. These differences were <strong>no longer</strong> significant with regression analysis controlling for study center, GA, severity of illness, and the number of low BP values.

As a result, management of BP for this group of patients varies across centers. (See <a href=\"#H3868542968\" class=\"local\">'Challenges'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Challenges regarding low BP management in EPT infants include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lack of consensus for definition for low BP &ndash; There is no universally accepted definition due to the wide range of observed normal BP values resulting from numerous physiologic factors (eg, GA and postnatal age) that affect BP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110236\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110236 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110237 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110007\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110007 \">figure 4</a>).

However, for both methods, it is important to ensure that measurement is performed appropriately so that BP values are reliable and consistent. Noninvasive measurements are typically higher than values obtained from a UAC. BP measurements are compared with normative data, which are typically obtained by UAC, based on GA and postnatal age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110236\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110236 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110237 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110007\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110007 \">figure 4</a>).
