The aPL detection tests included in APS classification criteria are anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody (immunoglobulin G [IgG] or IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), anti-beta2-glycoprotein (GP) I antibody (IgG or IgM) ELISA, and lupus anticoagulant (LA) assay. Although cardiolipin is a phospholipid, most of the clinically relevant antibodies detected in this assay are actually binding to phospholipid-binding protein(s), frequently beta2-GP I, that bind to the cardiolipin in the assay. There are other aPL that are not included in APS classification criteria (eg, antibodies directed against prothrombin, phosphatidylserine, or phosphatidylinositol) which are not routinely obtained because of lack of standardized testing and uncertainty about their clinical significance.

(See <a href=\"#H72934358\" class=\"local\">'Classification criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>In contrast to IgG and IgM isotypes of aCL and anti-beta2-GP I, the association of the IgA isotypes with clinical thrombosis remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. We generally do not test for the IgA isotypes when evaluating for APS, and we generally do not consider these antibodies as supportive evidence for the diagnosis of APS if they are reported. However, many laboratories routinely test for IgA isotypes, given that rarely patients present with persistent isolated moderate-high titer IgA aCL or anti-beta2-GP I in the setting of aPL-related clinical events. The Laboratory Diagnostics and Trends APS Task Force of the 14<sup>th</sup> International Congress on aPL concluded that low-quality evidence exists to include IgA isotype as part of the APS Classification Criteria, especially since these isotypes are usually associated with other aPL, making it difficult to understand the role of IgA alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, the utility of the IgA isotypes is generally restricted to those patients with a strong clinical suspicion for APS but who have tested negative for other tests for aPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Additional prospective studies are needed to better understand the role of IgA aCL antibody as a thrombosis risk factor.</p><p>The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) revised classification criteria for SLE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F86633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86633 \">table 1</a>) include IgA isotype of aCL and anti-beta2-GP I as part of the definition of aPL positivity; IgA isotype may have implications for SLE classification given that it is more common in SLE patients, compared with aPL-positive patients without other autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

While we obtain all of the tests listed above, it is worth noting that the presence of a large thrombosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the use of an anticoagulant may falsely normalize the result for aPTT testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91267\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91267 \">table 2</a>). Thus, a normal aPTT or other LA screening test in the acute setting may be inaccurate and need repeating. The immunoassays (ELISA assays for aCL or beta-2-GP I) are not affected by acute thrombosis or anticoagulant administration. (See <a href=\"#H172884294\" class=\"local\">'Patients on an anticoagulant'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confirmatory aPL testing</strong> &ndash; In patients with initial positive testing for aPL, testing should be repeated after at least 12 weeks to confirm persistence of the aCL, anti-beta2-GPI, or LA test. Transiently elevated levels of IgG or IgM aCL, as well as a positive LA test, can occur in the setting of some infections or drug exposures. (See <a href=\"#H763875928\" class=\"local\">'Other conditions associated with aPL'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Positive results from aPL testing on two tests &ge;12 weeks apart satisfies the laboratory criteria for the classification of APS (see <a href=\"#H72934358\" class=\"local\">'Classification criteria'</a> below). For the majority of patients who do not have laboratory evidence of APS from this testing, we do not perform additional antibody testing. However, repeat testing may be appropriate in selected cases in which the clinical suspicion for APS is especially high.</p><p>The need for confirmatory testing due to the transient nature of aPL was illustrated in a study including randomly selected blood donors who were tested for the presence aCL and LA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. On initial testing, 28 of 503 (5.6 percent) were positive for IgG aCL, 38 of 457 (8.3 percent) were positive for IgM aCL, and an additional 5 (0.9 percent) were positive for both. The number who remained positive for aCL upon repeat testing declined progressively at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; at one year, only four were positive for IgG aCL (0.8 percent), one for IgM aCL (0.2 percent), and none for both isotypes. There were no positive tests for LA in any patient at any point, and none of the individuals had clinical evidence of APS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172884294\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients on an anticoagulant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who are receiving an anticoagulant, we test for aCL and anti-beta2-GP I antibodies because the results are unaffected by the presence of an anticoagulant. As noted above, anticoagulants can prolong the aPTT and make interpretation of the aPTT or other LA screening test more challenging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91267\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91267 \">table 2</a>). Communication with the consulting specialist and laboratory personnel is advised prior to LA testing in a patient receiving an anticoagulant. This subject is discussed in more detail separately.

Thrombophilia testing may include evaluation for inherited thrombophilias such as the factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation; deficiency of protein S, protein C, and antithrombin; myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN); or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

As mentioned above, the revised Sapporo criteria requires that a patient satisfy at least one clinical criterion related to either a vascular thrombosis or an adverse pregnancy outcome, as well as the presence of one or more specified antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. The revised Sapporo criteria are considered useful in clinical practice to avoid &ldquo;over-diagnosis&rdquo; of APS. (See <a href=\"#H72934358\" class=\"local\">'Classification criteria'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H789790526\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients who do not meet classification criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, we diagnose APS in patients who do not fulfill the revised Sapporo criteria. Examples include individuals with otherwise unexplained thrombocytopenia, heart valve disease, renal thrombotic microangiopathy (aPL nephropathy), or those with aPL-related clinical events and borderline aPL testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Consultation with a clinician with expertise in the diagnosis of APS is advised.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is broad and includes other causes of arterial and venous thrombosis and recurrent pregnancy loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2160960287\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes of thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other causes of thrombosis include inherited and acquired thrombophilias, anatomical vascular obstruction, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Like APS, these conditions may be associated with arterial or venous thromboembolism, with or without cytopenias. Unlike APS, these conditions are not associated with laboratory evidence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). On the other hand, patients with APS may have coexisting risk factors for thrombotic events, including any of the disorders mentioned in this section. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4092793078\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes of recurrent pregnancy loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other causes of recurrent pregnancy loss include chromosomal abnormalities, anatomical abnormalities of the uterus, and endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism. Like APS, individuals with these abnormalities may have early or late pregnancy loss. Unlike APS, these conditions generally are not associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism or the presence of aPL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of couples with recurrent pregnancy loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4063492555\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic individuals with aPL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1962611196\"><span class=\"h3\">Transient aPL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A minority of healthy individuals have transient aPL but do not have clinical thrombosis or other features of APS. The clinical significance is unclear, but follow-up testing to assess the persistence of an aPL in selected individuals may be helpful. The clinical impact of repeat testing in asymptomatic individuals with aPL depends on how the results will be incorporated into patient management. For patients with multiple strongly positive tests, repeat testing provides information about potential risk assessment; by contrast, for patients with a single borderline positive test, repeat testing can be used to confirm that the result is likely to be clinically irrelevant. However, in some individuals, particularly those with other thrombosis risk factors, the presence of aPL is associated with an increased risk of developing APS. (See <a href=\"#H60490098\" class=\"local\">'Antiphospholipid antibody testing'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4114688592\"><span class=\"h3\">Persistent medium or high titer aPL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally individuals are identified who have persistent medium or high titer aPL (possibly meeting the revised Sapporo laboratory criteria) but no clinical manifestations of APS. The two most common scenarios in which this occurs are patients with SLE who are routinely screened for aPL and patients undergoing coagulation screening for an unrelated indication who are found to have a lupus anticoagulant (LA). While these patients do not have APS, they are at risk for clinical manifestations of APS as noted above. It is reasonable to assume that all patients with APS were, for some period of time in the past, asymptomatic individuals with significant levels of aPL. The level of risk and the role of prophylaxis in such patients is controversial and discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome#H2178609095\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;, section on 'Primary thrombosis prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H763875928\"><span class=\"h2\">Other conditions associated with aPL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to their occurrence in primary APS, aPL may be present in some people who are otherwise healthy, have an autoimmune or rheumatic disease, and have been exposed to certain drugs or infectious agents. The presence of aPL alone, in the absence of a thrombotic event or pregnancy morbidity, is insufficient for diagnosis of the clinical syndrome of APS, as detailed above (see <a href=\"#H178994\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above). The evaluation of a patient with a positive aPL for these conditions depends on the presentation and clinical setting. In general, we limit our evaluation to a thorough history and physical examination and testing appropriate to evaluate clinical findings. We do not perform extensive laboratory testing or other studies to evaluate for these conditions in the absence of other clinical findings suggestive of APS.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autoimmune and rheumatic diseases</strong> &ndash; The most frequent rheumatic disease associated with aPL is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
