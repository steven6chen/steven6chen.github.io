Glucocorticoids, bronchodilators, antibiotics, and mucolytic agents can be administered via aerosol using a range of aerosol generating devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. In addition, indications for aerosol therapy will broaden as novel macromolecular medications are delivered via the respiratory tract for the treatment of both pulmonary and systemic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Thus, a basic knowledge of the uses and limitations of aerosol delivery systems, the properties of effective aerosols, and the anatomic considerations affecting aerosol delivery in infants and children is essential to the optimal use of this therapeutic modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. An overview of the delivery of inhaled medication in children will be presented here; specific aspects of medication delivery using nebulizers, pressurized metered dose inhalers (MDIs), and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are discussed separately.

From 6 to 60 percent of the total dose of medication is delivered to the peripheral airways when these devices are used optimally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

To be effective, drugs must be able to withstand the shear forces required to generate the aerosol and often must penetrate the mucus layer and airway mucosa to reach their target receptors or cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease state and ventilatory pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic and pathologic factors, as well as ventilatory patterns, alter the efficiency of aerosolized drug delivery. Aerosol particles may be deposited in the central, rather than lower, airways in diseases that are associated with decreased airway caliber such as asthma. In a study of infants with acute bronchiolitis, only 1.5 percent of aerosolized drug released from the nebulizer was deposited in the lung and 0.6 percent penetrated to the peripheral airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Partly for this reason, bronchodilators are not routinely recommended for treatment of bronchiolitis. However, most of this information is based upon studies of inhalers containing chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellants. Penetration into peripheral airways appears to be better with the hydrofluoroalkane propellants (HFAs) that have replaced CFCs, even in patients with significant obstructive airway disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Diseases causing mucus plugging or atelectasis, such as cystic fibrosis, may lead to reduction and marked heterogeneity in the distribution of particle deposition. Other factors such as tidal volume, breath-holding time, respiratory rate, and nose versus mouth breathing can dramatically alter the deposition of aerosolized particles in the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/7,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient technique, acceptance, and preference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Improper technique is a common cause for a suboptimal response to aerosolized medication, and poor understanding or acceptance may lead to noncompliance. Rapid inspiration from metered dose inhalers (MDIs) may increase inertial impaction of droplets in the central airways and decrease lung delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patient education is essential for the effective use of any aerosol delivery device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, patient factors such as weakness, severe arthritis or contractures, and altered mental status may mandate the use of specific delivery devices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS IN INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The deposition of medication in peripheral airways and alveoli is reduced in infants and young children, presumably due to their smaller airways, faster respiratory rates, and lower tidal volumes, which combine to lower the resident time of small particles in the airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/7-9,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data suggest that drug deposition in children older than five to six years of age is similar to that observed in adults and identical doses in children and adults result in similar plasma concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/18,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27</a>]. Thus, aerosol doses generally do not need to be decreased, except possibly in very young children. However, it is probable that variability exists based upon the specific medication used, drug delivery technique (tidal volume breathing compared with inspiratory breath hold), and delivery device employed.</p><p>The output of the aerosol generating device may exceed inspiratory flow rate in children younger than six months of age, resulting in the loss of air entrainment (mixing of inspired air with nebulizer output) and a higher concentration of drug delivered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Overall, this effect can lead to a higher inhaled dose per kilogram of body weight in the infant younger than six months of age, increasing the possibility of side effects, although increased side effects have not been reported in this age group, nor are there recommendations to decrease any drug dose because of this effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal tidal breathing results in the most efficient delivery to the airways. Crying markedly reduces aerosol delivery to the lungs; therefore, in general, aerosols should not be administered to crying children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. An alternative in these infants and children is to administer aerosols while they are sleeping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, lung deposition of aerosolized drugs may be reduced in a nose-breathing sleeping infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Furthermore, a &quot;real-life&quot; feasibility study of aerosol delivery via metered dose inhaler (MDI) and masked holding chamber to sleeping infants and young children found that aerosol delivery during sleep offered no advantage for most children due to frequent awakenings associated with poor cooperation and difficulty with the proper placement of the mask due to sleep position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Thus, aerosol administration during sleep may be tried for uncooperative infants and children, but parents should be informed that the success rate may be low.</p><p>Breath-actuated devices and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) should be avoided in infants and toddlers due to their inability to generate an adequate inspiratory flow rate to reliably aerosolize the medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-inhaler-devices-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of inhaler devices in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Interface</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interface between the aerosol generating device and the patient is an important, and often overlooked, component of effective therapy. Administration of aerosols by a mouthpiece rather than a facemask is generally preferred due to improved drug delivery to the lungs by as much as twofold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, most children will not be able to reliably breathe through a mouthpiece until approximately four years of age, and patient technique with a mouthpiece must be assessed prior to switching from a facemask [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, delivery by facemasks or mouthpieces has been shown to provide similar clinical responses when administering bronchodilators in children with acute asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] or nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">budesonide</a> in chronic asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Finally, delivery of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluticasone</a> propionate via an MDI with an antistatic valved holding chamber is similar when using either a mouthpiece or facemask in children up to nine years of age, and both are associated with higher delivery compared with direct actuation into the mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These devices may be associated with higher systemic concentrations of glucocorticoids and an increased risk of side effects, particularly with higher drug doses. Thus, doses should be adjusted to the lowest that maintains asthma control.</p><p>Poor patient cooperation leads many parents to use blow-by techniques for aerosol delivery. However, removing the facemask just 1 cm from the face may reduce the inspired dose by approximately 50 percent, and a 2 cm distance results in an 80 percent reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. When a facemask is used either with a spacer or nebulizer, it should be placed snugly and tightly fitted over the face, as even a small leak may reduce the inhaled mass of drug to &lt;0.5 percent of the total dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The nose is an efficient filter for particles in aerosol. Thus, when using a facemask, any nose breathing is associated with increased deposition in the upper airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/24,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,39</a>]. This may lead to more systemic side effects due to greater drug absorption from the upper airway. In addition, this can reduce drug efficacy because of decreased deposition in the lower respiratory tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/delivery-of-inhaled-medication-in-children/abstract/1,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,35</a>].</p><p>Specific aspects of aerosolized medication delivery using nebulizers, MDIs, and DPIs are presented separately.
