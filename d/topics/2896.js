Electromagnetic interference (EMI) can occur in a variety of settings, but overall is more likely in the hospital environment than in the non-hospital environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>There have been occasional reports of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) being impacted by sources of EMI in the non-hospital environment (eg, slot machines, laptop computers, etc). There are also disclaimers that wireless sources could be the source of EMI with CIEDs, even though no published data exists (eg, automobile manufacturers providing &quot;caution&quot; for device patients purchasing automobiles with &quot;keyless&quot; entry mechanisms, hybrid engines, etc). Nonetheless, there are few sources of EMI in the non-hospital environment which are truly concerning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. However, with the proliferation of wireless technology, any new device which operates on a new frequency or new technology platform should be assessed in order to determine whether there is indeed any significant potential for EMI with any CIED.</p><p>Electromagnetic interference with medical sources is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacing-system-malfunction-evaluation-and-management#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pacing system malfunction: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Electromagnetic interference'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications#H3048475717\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac implantable electronic devices: Long-term complications&quot;, section on 'Electromagnetic interference'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no studies that have systematically evaluated the effect of household microwave ovens on implanted devices, it is widely accepted that contemporary pacemakers and ICDs are adequately shielded from microwave energy produced by modern appliances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pacemaker manufacturers <strong>do not</strong> recommend any special precautions when using common household appliances, such as televisions, radios, toasters, microwave ovens, and electric blankets. As a new appliance that uses a new or different energy source reaches the market, the appliance needs to be tested to determine whether there is any potential for device interference.</p><p>There are circumstances in which a device may be affected by specific sources of energy under narrow circumstances. This was illustrated in a study assessing the potential for induction cook tops to interfere with pacemaker function. Patients with a unipolar, left-sided implant could experience interference if the pot was not concentrically placed on the induction coil and if the patient stood as close as possible to the cook top. The most common response to interference was a reset to an asynchronous interference mode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most contemporary devices utilize bipolar pacing and sensing configuration, which minimizes the chance of device malfunction from electromagnetic interference. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CELLULAR TELEPHONES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The wide use of cellular telephones resulted in a heightened awareness of the potential adverse effects of their use on device function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Permanent pacemakers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cellular telephones are unlikely to cause clinically significant interference with cardiac devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>Signals from the cellular phone originate at the base of the antennae. Therefore, device patients should avoid carrying an activated cellular telephone with the base of the antennae close to the device. For example, patients should avoid carrying the telephone in a breast pocket over the device. Practically speaking, it probably does not matter whether the patient uses the phone at the ear on the same side as the device or the contralateral side, but use on the contralateral side will maximally reduce the risk of interference.</p><p>The power radiated from the cellular telephone is at its peak for a brief period when the phone is ringing. A study of early generation digital cellular phone technology noted interference produced by a ringing phone in 1.5 percent of tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A subsequent study of permanent pacemaker function during &quot;third generation&quot; mobile phone use was performed in 100 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Investigators programmed the pacemakers to unipolar sensing and pacing modes with maximum sensitivity to simulate the &quot;worst-case scenario&quot;. Even with this programming, there was no interference in pacemaker function during mobile phone use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vivo studies and clinical experience suggest that there does not appear to be any significant interference with ICDs from wireless communication devices such as cellular telephones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, cellular telephones can potentially disturb telemetry when located near the programming head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Nevertheless, as with the recommendations for pacemaker patients, it is recommended that the patient with an ICD not carry or place a digital cellular telephone within 15 cm (6 in) of the device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]; they should not be used during ICD interrogation and programming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SECURITY SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electromagnetic security systems (eg, antishoplifting gates, metal detectors) are in widespread use, and are often present in or near the workplace, in shopping malls, and at airports. Although device interference is possible, it is unlikely that any clinically significant interference would occur with the transient exposure associated with walking through such a field. There are case reports of inappropriate shocks and pacemaker inhibition associated with continued close exposure to electromagnetic security systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The best recommendation to patients is &quot;don't linger, don't lean,&quot; (ie, be aware of the location of security systems and simply move through them at a normal pace) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Single-beat inhibition of a device by anti-theft equipment would not be of clinical concern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Permanent pacemakers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electronic security systems can potentially interfere with pacemakers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The frequency and type of complications that can occur was evaluated in a study of 204 patients who were exposed to an electronic security system for up to 30 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. One or more episodes of pacemaker function interference developed in 17 percent of patients. Sensing abnormalities were the most common type of interference, and they were typically transient, lasting only for the duration of exposure. In patients with dual chamber pacemakers, interference at the atrial level was more common than at the ventricular level.</p><p>In another report, the most common complications were asynchronous pacing, atrial oversensing (producing a tachycardia in the ventricle), ventricular oversensing (with pacemaker inhibition), and paced beats due to direct induction of current in the pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Symptoms such as palpitations and presyncope occurred in some patients while they were in the security system field. Interference with pacemaker function can occur at a distance of 50 cm from the security system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This is of particular concern for those who are fully pacemaker-dependent; such patients should avoid remaining in close proximity to a security system. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are case reports of a patient with an ICD in whom interference from an electronic antitheft-surveillance device resulted in the delivery of multiple shocks due to oversensing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>]. In contrast, no interference was noted in another report of 25 patients with an ICD who were exposed to the fields of six different electronic article surveillance systems using three modes of operation (magnetic audio frequency, radiofrequency, or acoustomagnetic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The duration of exposure is an important determinant of risk as illustrated in a study of 170 patients with variable exposure to three common systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This again emphasizes the basic principle of &quot;don&rsquo;t linger, don&rsquo;t lean.&quot; </p><p>General consensus is that it is safe for patients with an ICD to walk through a metal detector gate, although the alarm may be triggered by the pulse generator case. Although it is safe for airport personnel to use a hand held metal detector or &quot;wand&quot;, a manual or pat-down search can be requested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTERNAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential causes of concern in the workplace are welders, industrial welding machines, electric motors, and degaussing coils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>]. Functional evaluation of pacemakers and ICDs in the work place has rarely demonstrated oversensing of an external electrical field. Nevertheless, since interference remains a concern, it is recommended that assessment of potential electromagnetic sources in the workplace be performed when the patient returns to work. For the non-pacemaker dependent patient this should rarely, if ever, be a problem. For the pacemaker-dependent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ICD patient it may be necessary to monitor the patient with an ambulatory monitor to determine if proximity to <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> use of specific equipment results in any interference. Rarely, for patients that are felt to be at higher risk or using equipment that is known to generate higher electromagnetic fields, it may be necessary to have the work environment assessed by an occupational safety officer or engineer prior to return to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">LEAKAGE OF CURRENT FROM ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT DRIVEN BY A POWER LINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For monitoring or therapeutic purposes, a patient may be connected to electromechanical equipment that is connected to a power-line. Such connections may permit accidental flow or leakage of weak alternating current through patients to ground. Similarly, an intracardiac catheter may provide a low-resistance path to ground through the patient's heart and thereby place the patient at risk for electrically induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSCUTANEOUS MUSCLE/NERVE STIMULATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several case reports of electromagnetic interference resulting from transcutaneous muscle or nerve stimulation which caused inappropriate ICD discharges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, for many patients with implantable devices a transcutaneous stimulator can be used. For the pacemaker dependent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ICD patient, a monitored in-clinic assessment while operating the stimulator in the desired location should be considered prior to allowing the patient to use the equipment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37082890\"><span class=\"h1\">SMALL MAGNETS INCORPORATED INTO CLOTHING, FURNITURE, AND IDENTIFICATION BADGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients occasionally ask about the use of magnets that have been incorporated into clothing, jewelry, furniture (specifically mattresses), and identification badges. While there could be potential for electromagnetic interference with a cardiac implantable electronic device, it would be dependent on the strength of the magnet. There is a relative paucity of published literature, although there is a case report of small magnetic snaps sewn inside a patient's jacket resulting in interference and audible alerts from his ICD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-interactions-with-electromagnetic-fields-in-the-non-hospital-environment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues relating to MR imaging and cardiac devices are discussed separately.
