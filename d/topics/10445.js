However, our ability to treat both of these abnormalities allows most women with this disorder to become pregnant. Management during pregnancy is based on knowledge of the risks to the mother and the fetus.</p><p>The management of women with lactotroph adenomas during pregnancy will be reviewed here.

Management should begin before lowering the prolactin concentration with a discussion about the risks of pregnancy on adenoma growth and the potential effects of exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonists on the fetus.

The main concern for the mother is adenoma growth, while the potential risk for the fetus is exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonists, which are used to permit ovulation. To date, neither <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> nor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a>, the dopamine agonists used for this purpose, have been associated with adverse fetal outcomes when compared with what is expected in the general population.

The theoretical basis for an increase in size during pregnancy is that hyperestrogenemia causes lactotroph hyperplasia. As an example of the normal effect of estrogen, a study of 20 normal nonpregnant women and 32 normal pregnant women showed a progressive increase in pituitary size, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), throughout pregnancy, so that the volume during the third trimester was more than double that in nonpregnant women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73519\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73519 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-lactotroph-adenoma-prolactinoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similarly, in women with lactotroph adenomas who become pregnant, the hyperestrogenemia of pregnancy may increase the size of the adenoma.</p><p>The risk that the increase in size of a lactotroph adenoma will be clinically important depends upon the size of the adenoma before pregnancy. For a microadenoma (&lt;10 mm in diameter), the risk is very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-lactotroph-adenoma-prolactinoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. A review of 12 studies reporting a total of 658 patients with lactotroph microadenomas showed that only 2.7 percent exhibited a symptomatic increase in the size of the adenoma during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-lactotroph-adenoma-prolactinoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>The risk is substantially higher in women with macroadenomas (&ge;10 mm in diameter). In the same review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-lactotroph-adenoma-prolactinoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], only 4.8 percent of 148 women who had macroadenomas that had been treated by prior surgery or radiation developed clinically significant enlargement during pregnancy, but 22.9 percent of 214 women who had not had such treatment did. Enlargement not accompanied by symptoms or visual field deficit was not counted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10534154\"><span class=\"h3\">Macroadenomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with lactotroph macroadenomas may develop clinically significant enlargement during pregnancy unless they receive pretreatment to remove or decrease the size of the adenoma. (See <a href=\"#H103130479\" class=\"local\">'Discuss risk of adenoma growth'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103130740\"><span class=\"h4\">Dopamine agonists to decrease size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A woman with a lactotroph macroadenoma should be treated to shrink the adenoma before she attempts to become pregnant. She should be advised of the relatively higher risk of clinically important tumor enlargement during pregnancy, as described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-lactotroph-adenoma-prolactinoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] (see <a href=\"#H103130479\" class=\"local\">'Discuss risk of adenoma growth'</a> above). Advice on management depends upon how large the adenoma is. If the adenoma does not elevate the optic chiasm, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a> for a sufficient period to shrink it, so that it no longer extends above the sella, prior to trying to conceive. This should reduce the chance of clinically important enlargement during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-lactotroph-adenoma-prolactinoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. Once this has occurred, the woman can attempt to become pregnant; the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonist should be discontinued when pregnancy has been confirmed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10534119\"><span class=\"h4\">Indications for surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the adenoma elevates the optic chiasm and does not shrink substantially in response to a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonist, we recommend transsphenoidal surgery to reduce adenoma size. Such a regimen reduces the chance that symptomatic expansion will occur during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-lactotroph-adenoma-prolactinoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], but it may still occur.

Serum prolactin concentrations between 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (normal &lt;15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> typically cause either amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, while levels greater than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> result in deficient estradiol and progesterone secretion and amenorrhea.

If the serum prolactin concentration does not fall to near normal or normal by then, the dose can be increased to 2.5 mg twice a day and, if necessary, to 5.0 mg twice a day.

Evidence to date does not suggest risk to the fetus from this exposure.</p><p>Data from over 6000 pregnancies suggest that the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> during the first month of pregnancy does not harm the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-lactotroph-adenoma-prolactinoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this series, the incidence of spontaneous abortions (9.9 percent), multiple births (1.7 percent), and malformations (1.8 percent) was no higher than in the general population.

Continuous use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> during pregnancy has been reported in approximately 100 women. Although the rate of congenital malformations did not appear to be higher than nonexposed pregnancies, there was one case of undescended testis and one of talipes deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-lactotroph-adenoma-prolactinoma-during-pregnancy/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>].</p><p>Although the number of pregnancies in women taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a> at the time of conception is much smaller, the evidence suggests that this drug is safe as well.

The main concern for the mother is adenoma growth, while the potential risk for the fetus is exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonists. (See <a href=\"#H103131104\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A woman who has a lactotroph microadenoma should be told that the risk of clinically important enlargement of her adenoma during pregnancy is very small and that it should not be a deterrent to becoming pregnant. (See <a href=\"#H103130479\" class=\"local\">'Discuss risk of adenoma growth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonist to lower the serum prolactin concentration to normal and thereby permit ovulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H103129806\" class=\"local\">'Restoration of ovulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonist is needed to lower the serum prolactin concentration to permit ovulation, we suggest either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Bromocriptine has the advantage of the greater certainty that it does not cause birth defects, but cabergoline has the advantage that it is more likely to be tolerated and more likely to be effective in lowering the prolactin. We recommend stopping dopamine agonist therapy once pregnancy has been confirmed because the safety of continued usage has not been established (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H103129806\" class=\"local\">'Restoration of ovulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A woman who has a lactotroph macroadenoma should be advised of the relatively higher risk of clinically important adenoma enlargement during pregnancy and therefore the need for treatment to shrink the adenoma before attempting to become pregnant. (See <a href=\"#H103130479\" class=\"local\">'Discuss risk of adenoma growth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with macroadenomas that do not elevate the optic chiasm, we suggest treatment with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonist to decrease the size of the adenoma prior to pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Once this has occurred, the woman can attempt to become pregnant; the dopamine agonist should be discontinued when pregnancy has been confirmed. (See <a href=\"#H103130740\" class=\"local\">'Dopamine agonists to decrease size'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with a macroadenoma that <strong>does</strong> elevate the optic chiasm, we suggest transsphenoidal surgery and then possibly radiation or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonist treatment before attempting to become pregnant. (See <a href=\"#H10534154\" class=\"local\">'Macroadenomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During pregnancy, women with either a micro- or macroadenoma should be seen every three months and asked about headaches and changes in vision. A perceived change in vision should be assessed by visual field testing. In addition, a woman who has an adenoma that extends above the sella should have visual fields every three months, even if she does not notice a change in vision. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed if a visual field abnormality consistent with a pituitary adenoma is confirmed. (See <a href=\"#H607786647\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the MRI shows that the adenoma has enlarged to a degree that could account for the visual abnormality, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a> throughout the remainder of the pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This treatment will usually decrease the size of the adenoma and alleviate the visual defect. If bromocriptine is used first but the adenoma does not respond, we suggest a trial of cabergoline (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If cabergoline is not successful and vision is severely compromised, we suggest transsphenoidal surgery in the second trimester (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In the third trimester, surgery for persistent visual symptoms should be deferred until delivery if possible. (See <a href=\"#H607786792\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of enlarging adenoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeeding is not contraindicated in women who have lactotroph adenomas, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonists should not be used during breastfeeding, because they impair lactation. An exception is a woman who has visual field impairment, who should not breastfeed and should be treated with a dopamine agonist. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Breastfeeding and dopamine agonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three months after delivery in women who do not breastfeed or after breastfeeding, the need for resumption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> agonist treatment should be reevaluated by measurement of the serum prolactin concentration, since 40 to 60 percent of women who were treated with dopamine agonists for lactotroph adenomas prior to pregnancy do not require them afterwards.
