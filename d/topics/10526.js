Common clinical features include facial erythema, telangiectasias, and inflammatory papules or pustules. Many patients seek therapy due to concern over the effect of rosacea on physical appearance. As there is no cure for rosacea, treatment is focused on symptom suppression.</p><p>The management of rosacea will be discussed here. The pathogenesis and clinical features of rosacea are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosacea-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2324127\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rosacea can manifest with a wide variety of cutaneous features. Examples include persistent centrofacial redness, phymatous skin changes (eg, rhinophyma), papules, pustules, flushing, telangiectases, burning or stinging sensations, edema, and skin dryness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F77020%7EDERM%2F56083%7EDERM%2F67890%7EDERM%2F78747%7EDERM%2F61822\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77020 graphicRef56083 graphicRef67890 graphicRef78747 graphicRef61822 \">picture 1A-E</a>). Ocular involvement may also occur, manifesting with lid margin telangiectases, conjunctival injection, ocular irritation, or other signs and symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosacea-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H432867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The classification of rosacea has evolved from a division into distinct subtypes (erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, papulopustular rosacea, phymatous rosacea, and ocular rosacea) to a phenotype-based approach that views the various features of rosacea as manifestations of a continuous multivariate disease process. The approach to treatment is guided by the clinical features present in an individual patient. Given the common presence of multiple features, combination therapy may be necessary to achieve satisfactory control of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1009797073\" class=\"local\">'Facial redness, flushing, skin sensitivity, and skin dryness'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2325345\" class=\"local\">'Papules and pustules'</a> below and <a href=\"#H695717\" class=\"local\">'Ocular manifestations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H694796\" class=\"local\">'Phymatous skin changes'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosacea-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H811056387\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2324134\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MEASURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic interventions may be useful for the management of the cutaneous manifestations of rosacea. These include avoidance of triggers of flushing, gentle skin care, sun-protection, and the use of cosmetic products. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2324141\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of flushing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Easy flushing is a common feature of rosacea. Flushing is a prominent and troubling symptom for some patients, and some authors have proposed that flushing may contribute to worsening of other features of rosacea, such as inflammatory papules, erythema, and skin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p>Potential triggers for flushing include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/3,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremes of temperature</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunlight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spicy foods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcohol </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute psychological stressors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menopausal hot flashes </p><p/><p>Individual patients may also have unique triggers for flushing, and the degree of flushing in response to the above stimuli is variable. Thus, asking patients to keep a diary of flushing episodes and potential associated factors can be useful for identifying and avoiding pertinent triggers. In addition, practical measures to reduce flushing after encounters with stimuli, such as applying cool compresses and transferring to cool environments, may be helpful. </p><p>A variety of pharmacologic agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, beta-blockers, antidepressants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetazoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymetazoline</a> have been used in attempts to reduce flushing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/8-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-15</a>]. However, data are limited on their efficacy in rosacea and no single therapy appears to be consistently effective. Moreover, the potential for drug-related adverse effects must be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-flushing-in-adults#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to flushing in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Laser, intense pulsed light, and photodynamic therapy also have been used for patients with rosacea-related flushing, but data are limited on treatment effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2324148\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with rosacea, particularly those with centrofacial erythema and telangiectases, can experience heightened sensitivity of facial skin characterized by difficulty tolerating topical cosmetics, skin care products, and topical medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, rough, dry, or scaly facial skin is a common feature. </p><p>It is unclear whether subjective skin sensitivity and dryness result from abnormalities in skin barrier function that precede the development of rosacea, or whether they occur as a consequence of the inflammatory process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Regardless, gentle skin care practices may help to reduce symptoms. Appropriate measures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Frequent skin moisturization </strong>&ndash; Emollients help to repair and maintain cutaneous barrier function and may be useful in rosacea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In a 15-day, split-face study of 20 patients with rosacea (manifesting as erythema, flushing, sensitive and dry skin, stinging, burning, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin discomfort) treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> 0.75% gel, concomitant application of a moisturizing cream twice daily was associated with a significant reduction in experimentally-induced symptoms of skin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Relatively greater reductions in scores of skin dryness, roughness, and discomfort were also detected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gentle skin cleansing </strong>&ndash; Despite their sensitive skin, patients should cleanse their faces at least once daily. Patients should be instructed to cleanse their skin gently with lukewarm water, to wash with their fingers, and to avoid harsh mechanical scrubbing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24</a>]. Non-soap cleansers with synthetic detergents (eg, beauty bars, mild cleansing bars, many liquid facial cleansers) are usually better tolerated than traditional soaps. The latter are alkaline, which may raise the pH of the skin to abnormal levels and impair skin barrier function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast, synthetic detergent cleansers typically have a pH that more closely approximates the normal pH of the skin (skin pH = 4.0 to 6.5).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of irritating topical products </strong>&ndash; Patients should avoid topical products that may irritate the skin, such as toners, astringents, and chemical exfoliating agents (eg, alpha hydroxy acids) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Manual exfoliation with rough sponges or cloths also should be avoided. Skin care products in the form of foams, powders, or creams are generally better tolerated than alcohol-based gels and thin lotions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, cosmetics should be easy to remove to avoid the need for harsh cleansing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2324155\"><span class=\"h2\">Sun protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of sun exposure in the pathogenesis of rosacea is uncertain. Flares of facial redness and flushing may be stimulated by exposure to radiant heat from the sun, and ultraviolet radiation may induce cutaneous changes that promote rosacea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosacea-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H433400\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Ultraviolet radiation'</a>.)</p><p>We routinely recommend daily application of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, and educate patients on mid-day sun avoidance and the use of sun-protective clothing. Sunscreens in the form of creams, lotions, or preparations that contain barrier protective silicones (eg, dimethicone or cyclomethicone) are preferred over those in an alcohol-based vehicle, which may be more likely to cause irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2324162\"><span class=\"h2\">Cosmetic camouflage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For female patients who are bothered by facial erythema or telangiectasias, green-tinted foundation can help to camouflage these features. A flesh-colored facial foundation should be applied on top of the green-tinted foundation to achieve a color that matches the patient's complexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For men, light application of a green-tinted cosmetic facial powder can be useful for camouflaging facial redness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1009797073\"><span class=\"h1\">FACIAL REDNESS, FLUSHING, SKIN SENSITIVITY, AND SKIN DRYNESS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2324942\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic measures may assist with reducing facial redness, flushing, skin sensitivity, and skin dryness, and are sufficient for the management of some patients with mild symptoms. When satisfactory improvement cannot be attained with these interventions, treatment with lasers, intense pulsed light, or pharmacologic agents is an option. The treatment of flushing is challenging; the management of this feature is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H2324141\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of flushing'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-flushing-in-adults#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to flushing in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2324949\"><span class=\"h3\">First-line interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral changes can be beneficial. We educate all patients on the avoidance of triggers of flushing, proper use of sun protection, and gentle skin care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2324134\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2324956\"><span class=\"h3\">Second-line interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who fail to improve adequately with behavioral interventions and who desire additional treatment may benefit from medical intervention. Options include light-based modalities and pharmacologic agents. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H696617\"><span class=\"h4\">Laser and intense pulsed light</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laser and light-based therapies, which have been used extensively for the treatment of a variety of vascular lesions, have also been used for the vascular features of rosacea, especially telangiectasias. During treatment, light energy is absorbed by hemoglobin in cutaneous vessels, leading to vessel heating and coagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions#H12728454\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions&quot;, section on 'Principles'</a>.)</p><p>Vascular lesions are commonly treated with lasers that emit green or yellow light (eg, pulsed dye or potassium titanyl phosphate [KTP] lasers) due to the relatively high absorption of light in these ranges by hemoglobin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F74419\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74419 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72989 \">table 1</a>). Intense pulsed light devices, which are also frequently used for this indication, are lower energy light sources that emit noncoherent light in a broad range of wavelengths. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions#H12728466\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions&quot;, section on 'Vascular lasers'</a>.)</p><p>Improvement in both facial erythema and telangiectasias can occur after treatment with pulsed dye lasers, KTP lasers, or intense pulsed light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/16,29-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,29-42</a>]. Most data on the efficacy of these modalities are derived from uncontrolled studies. One split-face randomized trial compared treatment with a pulsed dye laser with nonpurpuragenic settings to intense pulsed light and no treatment in 29 patients with rosacea. The two therapies were similarly beneficial for facial erythema and telangiectasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laser-and-light-therapy-for-cutaneous-vascular-lesions#H10061370\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions&quot;, section on 'Telangiectasias and the red face'</a>.)</p><p>Near infrared lasers can be used to treat large, deep telangiectasias, but are associated with increased risk for adverse effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72989 \">table 1</a>). Improvement in other clinical features, such as flushing, skin sensitivity, and skin texture have also been reported in patients treated with laser or intense pulsed light therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/16,18,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18,43</a>]. </p><p>Light-based modalities do not cure rosacea, and periodic treatments to maintain improvement are often required. Potential adverse effects of laser and intense pulsed light therapy include skin dyspigmentation, blistering, ulceration, and scarring. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H501291\"><span class=\"h4\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pharmacologic agent with the strongest evidence for efficacy for persistent facial erythema in rosacea is topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brimonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brimonidine</a>. Data from studies in patients with papulopustular rosacea suggest that medications primarily used for papulopustular disease (eg, topical antimicrobials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azelaic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azelaic acid</a>, and oral antibiotics) may also have benefit for the reduction of rosacea-associated facial erythema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/44-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-52</a>]. However, no high-quality randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of these therapies in patients without papules and pustules. In our experience, satisfactory improvement in persistent facial erythema with medications used for papulopustular disease is uncommon. Telangiectasias are particularly unlikely to improve with medications, and are best managed with light-based treatments. (See <a href=\"#H696617\" class=\"local\">'Laser and intense pulsed light'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86757015\"><span class=\"h5\">Topical brimonidine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brimonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Brimonidine</a> tartrate, a vasoconstrictive alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of open angle glaucoma, has emerged as a treatment for rosacea-associated facial erythema. The efficacy of this agent when applied topically is supported by the results of phase II and phase III randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved brimonidine 0.33% gel for the treatment of persistent (nontransient) facial erythema of rosacea based upon the findings of two 29-day placebo-controlled randomized trials conducted in a total of 553 adults with moderate to severe persistent facial erythema of rosacea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. At the end of the study, at least two-grade reductions in both clinician and patient assessment scales were achieved three hours after application by 31 and 25 percent of patients treated with brimonidine 0.33% gel versus only 11 and 9 percent of patients treated with vehicle. The efficacy of topical brimonidine has not been directly compared with laser or intense pulsed light therapy. </p><p>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brimonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brimonidine</a> 0.33% gel appears to be well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. An open-label study in which women applied a 0.5% formulation of brimonidine tartrate gel supports the potential for continued safety and efficacy of topical brimonidine over one year of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The most common adverse effects are erythema, flushing, skin burning sensation, and contact dermatitis. The occurrence of severe, transient rebound erythema several hours after application has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. An occurrence of persistent erythema in skin adjacent to the site of long-term brimonidine application also has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The true incidence of worsening erythema is not known but has been estimated to be up to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Patients should be counseled about these side effects prior to therapy. </p><p>Because of concern for risk for potentiation of vascular insufficiency and hypotension during treatment with alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, cautious use is recommended in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, thromboangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome, and severe cardiovascular disease. Caution is also recommended for patients who are receiving treatment with anti-hypertensives, cardiac glycosides, central nervous system depressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brimonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brimonidine</a> may result in serious adverse effects and should be avoided.</p><p>The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brimonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brimonidine</a> on papulopustular lesions of rosacea has not been specifically studied. Topical brimonidine has not appeared to aggravate papulopustular lesions of rosacea in randomized trials evaluating its efficacy for facial erythema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Our experience suggests that brimonidine is not effective for the treatment of papulopustular lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1324472351\"><span class=\"h5\">Topical oxymetazoline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymetazoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxymetazoline</a>, an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist used for the treatment of nasal congestion, may have modest efficacy for facial erythema in rosacea. The 2017 FDA approval of oxymetazoline 1% cream for reducing persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea in adults was based upon two unpublished, randomized trials in which a total of 885 adults with rosacea applied either oxymetazoline or vehicle once daily for 29 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. More patients in the oxymetazoline groups achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (at least a two-grade reduction in erythema from baseline on both a 5-point clinician erythema assessment scale and a 5-point patient self-assessment scale at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after application) than in the vehicle groups. On day 29 in the first trial, 12 and 6 percent of patients receiving oxymetazoline and vehicle, respectively, achieved this endpoint three hours after application. In the second trial, this was achieved at the same time point by 14 and 7 percent of patients in the oxymetazoline and vehicle groups, respectively. Potential side effects of oxymetazoline include application site dermatitis, worsening of inflammatory rosacea lesions, pain, pruritus, and erythema.

Mild to moderate papulopustular disease is usually managed with topical agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azelaic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azelaic acid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfur-and-sulfacetamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfacetamide-sulfur</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> (see <a href=\"#H2325879\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate disease'</a> above).

Oral metronidazole (20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) has also been used in the treatment of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>]. As in adults, after oral antibiotics produce a remission, treatment with a topical agent may be used to maintain clearance.</p><p>Ocular manifestations of rosacea are managed similarly as in adults, with the exclusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> antibiotic therapy in children under the age of nine. Systemic antibiotics may be required for several months to achieve complete remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>].

The disorder is characterized by an abrupt onset of papules and suppurative nodules on the face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. Young women are most commonly affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosacea-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2149672\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pyoderma faciale (rosacea fulminans)'</a>.)</p><p>Data on the treatment of pyoderma faciale are limited to reports of clinical experience. Patients can be managed with a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a>. Prednisone is often started at 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day and tapered over a period of weeks, and isotretinoin is initiated around two weeks after the start of prednisone therapy with low doses of 0.2 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/149,153,154\" class=\"abstract_t\">149,153,154</a>]. During the steroid taper, the isotretinoin dose is slowly increased to 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day as tolerated. Some authors advocate treating until a cumulative dose of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> has been attained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]; others believe that isotretinoin can be discontinued once inflammatory lesions have resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]. We typically treat until a cumulative dose of 120 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> has been attained, provided treatment is tolerated. </p><p>Alternatives to the above regimen include initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> (1 g per day) along with a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> taper as above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/153,155\" class=\"abstract_t\">153,155</a>]. Successful treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-rosacea/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26656310\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rosacea is a common disorder that presents with a variety of clinical findings. The phenotype of rosacea determines the approach to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2324127\" class=\"local\">'Patient assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General measures to improve symptoms of flushing, erythema, and skin irritation can be beneficial for patients with rosacea. Patients should be educated on the avoidance of triggers of flushing, gentle skin care, and sun protection. Cosmetic camouflage is a useful adjunct for some patients. (See <a href=\"#H1009797073\" class=\"local\">'Facial redness, flushing, skin sensitivity, and skin dryness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral modifications may improve persistent facial erythema, telangiectasias, flushing, and sensitive skin. If persistent facial erythema does not improve sufficiently with behavioral changes, therapeutic interventions can be useful. For patients who desire a topical therapy for facial erythema that can be self-administered, we suggest treatment with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brimonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brimonidine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). Laser or intense pulsed light are additional effective treatment options for facial erythema. Periodic retreatment with laser or intense pulsed light is often necessary to maintain improvement. Facial telangiectasias are best managed with laser or intense pulsed light therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1009797073\" class=\"local\">'Facial redness, flushing, skin sensitivity, and skin dryness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few data to support the efficacy of treatments used for papules and pustules of rosacea (eg, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azelaic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azelaic acid</a>, or subantimicrobial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>) for persistent facial erythema. In our experience, satisfactory improvement with these therapies is uncommon. (See <a href=\"#H501291\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild to moderate rosacea manifesting with papules and pustules, we suggest treatment with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azelaic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azelaic acid</a>, or topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivermectin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivermectin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2325879\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate disease'</a> above). The lower cost of metronidazole 0.75% gel (the least expensive formulation of metronidazole) compared with azelaic acid and ivermectin favors the initial use of metronidazole. We also favor metronidazole or ivermectin in patients who present with significant facial sensitivity, due to the fairly frequent occurrence of irritation early in the course of therapy with azelaic acid. Topical sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfacetamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfacetamide</a> is an alternative topical therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with numerous papules or pustules or who have milder disease that fails to improve with topical agents, we suggest treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> for 4 to 12 weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Improvement may be maintained with topical agents or subantimicrobial doxycycline. (See <a href=\"#H2325908\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H689748\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with refractory papules or pustules may benefit from treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H693879\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular involvement in rosacea can result in damage to the ocular tissues. Patients with signs or symptoms of ocular involvement should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H695717\" class=\"local\">'Ocular manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Childhood rosacea is managed similarly to rosacea in adults. However, the use of oral tetracyclines should be <strong>avoided </strong>in children under the age of nine.
