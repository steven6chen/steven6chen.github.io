(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Normal ranges for hemoglobin/HCT'</a>.)</p><p>However, the WHO definition of anemia does not define goals of treatment among peritoneal dialysis patients. This is because the goals of treatment of anemia with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are to prevent the development of severe anemia and reduce the need for blood transfusions but not to normalize Hb levels. This approach is based on findings from several randomized, controlled trials among patients with chronic kidney disease and who are on hemodialysis showing that targeting a normal Hb with ESAs results in adverse outcomes. Studies have not been conducted in peritoneal dialysis patients. Regardless, the same principles likely apply to such patients. Thus, even when treated to accepted goals, peritoneal dialysis patients will have anemia as defined above.</p><p>In discussions below, we use specific Hb targets to define indications for treatment and the goals of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H645240729\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anemia is more common among peritoneal dialysis patients than the general population. Using hemoglobin (Hb) level &lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> as a definition of anemia, the reported prevalence of anemia among peritoneal dialysis patients ranges from 18 to 57 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Data from the 2015 United States Renal Data System indicate that the mean Hb in December 2014 was 10.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> among prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Overall, 55 percent of patients had Hb levels between 10 and 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> 21 percent had Hb &ge;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> and 23 percent had Hb &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Anemia is generally less severe among peritoneal dialysis patients compared with hemodialysis patients. In a study of Medicare data in the United States, 80.1 percent of peritoneal dialysis patients received erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in 2011 compared with 92 percent of hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The major reason that Hb levels are higher among peritoneal dialysis patients compared with hemodialysis patients is that, unlike hemodialysis, there is very little blood loss associated with the peritoneal dialysis procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, peritoneal dialysis patients are usually relatively younger, healthier, and less likely to have diabetes and other comorbidities than hemodialysis patients. Peritoneal dialysis patients usually have better preservation of residual renal function and thus continued production of some endogenous erythropoietin. Peritoneal dialysis patients may also have improved clearance of uremic inhibitors of erythropoiesis due to the continuous nature of peritoneal dialysis compared with intermittent (ie, standard) hemodialysis. However, the specific uremic toxin that inhibits erythropoiesis has not been identified.</p><p>Peritoneal dialysis patients also likely have less inflammation (which contributes to anemia) compared with hemodialysis patients due to lack of exposure to dialysis membrane and tubing.</p><p>Compared with nondialysis patients, however, peritoneal dialysis patients are still more likely to have chronic inflammation resulting from exposure of the peritoneum to high concentrations of glucose and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and, in some patients, recurrent peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Inadequate iron supplementation and noncompliance with prescribed ESA dose may also contribute to persistent anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H685179869\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2547716542\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should be screened for anemia upon initiation of maintenance peritoneal dialysis, particularly if they have not been closely followed prior to initiation. Patients are screened with a complete blood count (CBC).</p><p>Patients who are found to be anemic should be evaluated for cause. The initial evaluation of anemia is generally the same for peritoneal dialysis patients as in the general population. The evaluation should include CBC, red blood cell (RBC) indices, reticulocyte count, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin, serum folate and vitamin B12 levels, and testing for occult blood in stool if iron deficiency is documented.

The optimal frequency of monitoring is not known. Our approach is largely consistent with the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines and depends in part on whether patients are treated with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>We monitor all peritoneal dialysis patients for anemia and iron deficiency at least every three months. In addition, we monitor Hb whenever clinically indicated (such as after infections, major surgical procedures, hospitalization, or bleeding).</p><p>Among peritoneal dialysis patients who are treated with ESAs, we measure Hb at least monthly. We measure Hb more frequently during the initiation and titration of ESA (ie, every two weeks).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H805200768\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among most peritoneal dialysis patients, the treatment of anemia includes erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intravenous (IV) iron. The goal of treatment is to mitigate symptoms that may be related to anemia and to reduce the likelihood of needing a blood transfusion.</p><p>The selection of the individual therapy depends on the severity of anemia and on the status of the iron parameters. The indications for ESA treatment are based upon US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-issued guidelines, although these are occasionally modified in selected individuals. The indications for iron are highly clinician dependent and somewhat arbitrary. Our approach is consistent with the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, but we also consider individualized therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3657244893\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoglobin &lt;10 g/dL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Such patients are generally treated with IV iron, an ESA, or both, depending on the transferrin saturation (TSAT) and ferritin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F111080\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111080 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TSAT &le;30 percent</strong> &ndash; If the TSAT is &le;30 percent, we treat with IV iron, providing the ferritin is &le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and there is no active infection present.

Patients with malignancy or stroke are more likely to have an adverse effect of an ESA, and therapy must be individualized after a discussion of risk benefit with the patient. While some such patients may respond to IV iron alone, the frequency with which this occurs is likely small.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54589436\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoglobin 10 to 12 g/dL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of patients with mild anemia (Hb 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> in the absence of absolute iron deficiency (ie, TSAT &le;20 percent and ferritin &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL)</span> is controversial. Some clinicians treat such patients with IV iron, providing TSAT is &le;30 percent and ferritin is &le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span>. Others treat with oral iron if TSAT &lt;25 percent and ferritin &lt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span>. Still others do not treat mild anemia, unless there is clear evidence of absolute iron deficiency (ie, TSAT &le;20 percent and ferritin &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>.

Although there is some variability in results among studies, the most consistent observation has been that better quality of life, without an increase in adverse reactions, is associated with hemoglobin (Hb) values between 10 and 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> compared with values substantially below this range. There is general agreement that partial correction of severe anemia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients improves physiologic and clinical parameters and quality of life compared with the very low Hb levels that were common prior to the availability of ESAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>].</p><p>However, the benefits and risks of maintaining various target Hb levels are less well defined.

An important exception is among patients with recent history of or active malignancy, particularly those in whom cure is anticipated or who have had a stroke, since such patients may be at higher risk for adverse effects from ESAs. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommended that ESAs be used with great caution, if at all, in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with active malignancy, especially if cure is anticipated, or with a history of stroke or a history of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1440406998\"><span class=\"h3\">Route of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We routinely administer ESAs subcutaneously to all peritoneal dialysis patients. Studies have shown that the subcutaneous dose of erythropoietin required to achieve a target Hb is approximately 30 percent less than that required with intravenous (IV) administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>Subcutaneous administration also offers peritoneal dialysis patients the option to self-administer the drug without the need for a clinic visit (unless required for insurance reasons) and IV access. However, self-administration increases the risk of noncompliance, which occasionally underlies persistent anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H572625825\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial erythropoietin dose is approximately 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/week</span>. However, the use of lower doses would also be reasonable, particularly in patients with Hb values close to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. In practice, most peritoneal dialysis patients are dosed by unit dosing (eg, a vial), rather than on a strict <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> basis. Thus, most patients begin at 10,000 units subcutaneously once every one to two weeks.</p><p>Less frequent dosing regimens have been shown to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-29</a>], particularly if longer-acting agents, such as darbepoetin, are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. Studies in CKD and dialysis patients have reported successful administration of darbepoetin once monthly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. Monthly dosing may increase compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>We titrate the dose upwards by 25 percent as necessary to achieve the target Hb level. We adjust the dose monthly in response to the change in Hb level.</p><p>The Hb increase should generally be &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> per month since more rapid increases of Hb may be associated with adverse effects. The dose of ESA should be reduced in patients whose Hb rises above this threshold increase. Among those with an Hb increase greater than 2.5 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> per month, the ESA dose should be held or reduced by at least 50 percent. While some clinicians reduce the ESA dose (as is recommended in the KDIGO anemia guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]), holding the ESA completely may reduce the number of times that the Hb exceeds target and decrease the ESA used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anemia-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].
