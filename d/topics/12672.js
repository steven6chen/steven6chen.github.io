There are also very rare tumors that secrete corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) ectopically, and occasional cases are caused by cortisol secretion by ACTH-independent macronodular or micronodular hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex.</p><p>Treatment should be directed, whenever possible, at the primary cause of the syndrome.

The therapeutic protocols described below proceed from permanently curing the disorder by resecting or ablating its cause to merely controlling the hypercortisolism in patients in whom a cure cannot be achieved. Each stage in the treatment should provide maximum probability of cure with the least chance of permanent endocrine deficiency or other undesirable side effects.</p><p>Specific treatment may be delayed during diagnostic testing or while drug adjustments are made to achieve eucortisolism. During this time, treatment of co-morbidities such as hypertension, osteoporosis, and diabetes should be instituted, and the use of medications to prevent thrombosis or bone loss should be considered. Treatment should be continued after remission and discontinued only if these co-morbidities reverse. Our approach is largely consistent with the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Exogenous Cushing's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of Cushing's syndrome due to exogenous therapy is to stop the glucocorticoid. Most patients who have taken enough glucocorticoid for a long enough time to cause Cushing's syndrome will have a period of hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal insufficiency when therapy is discontinued. Thus, gradual withdrawal is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-use-of-glucocorticoids#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic use of glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'HPA axis suppression'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CUSHING'S DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to the treatment of Cushing's disease as outlined here is consistent with a 2015 consensus statement on the treatment of corticotropin (ACTH)-dependent Cushing's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Transsphenoidal surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of choice for Cushing's disease (ACTH-producing pituitary tumor) is transsphenoidal microadenomectomy when a clearly circumscribed microadenoma can be identified at surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76949\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76949 \">algorithm 1</a>). In the remaining patients, subtotal (85 to 90 percent) resection of the anterior pituitary may be indicated if future fertility is not desired.</p><p>It is difficult to predict residual pituitary function after partial hypophysectomy; some patients have normal pituitary function even after subtotal hypophysectomy. However, the more extensive the resection, the greater the risk of loss of pituitary function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-therapy-of-cushings-disease-transsphenoidal-surgery-and-pituitary-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary therapy of Cushing's disease: Transsphenoidal surgery and pituitary irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A practical approach to the uncertainty of surgical localization is to make a contract among the endocrinologist, the patient, and the neurosurgeon before surgery. If the neurosurgeon finds a microadenoma, he removes it. If he does not and fertility is not a concern of the patient, he performs a more extensive resection, proceeding to a subtotal hypophysectomy if no adenoma is found. Among expert pituitary neurosurgeons, the cure rate approximates 70 to 80 percent, but late recurrences reduce the permanent cure rate to approximately 60 to 70 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H609003423\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the hypercortisolism of Cushing's disease is optimally treated surgically, medical therapy is often required when surgery is delayed, contraindicated, or unsuccessful. Adrenal enzyme inhibitors are the most commonly used drugs, but adrenolytic agents, drugs that target the pituitary, and glucocorticoid-receptor antagonists also have been used. Medical therapy targeting the corticotroph tumor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pasireotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pasireotide</a> can result in normalization of 24-hour urinary free cortisol in 20 to 40 percent of them, especially if they have only mild hypercortisolism. The glucocorticoid (as well as progestin) antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> is approved in the United States for treatment of glucose intolerance in patients with Cushing's syndrome who are not surgical candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This topic is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-therapy-of-hypercortisolism-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical therapy of hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349412676\"><span class=\"h3\">Aggressive corticotroph tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While up to one-third of pituitary tumors, mostly macroadenomas, are locally invasive, a few are more aggressive and 0.1 to 0.2 percent are carcinomas that metastasize in the central nervous system or systemically. These aggressive tumors are resistant to treatment and result in death, usually within several months, or occasionally after several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Chemotherapy may offer temporary remission in a minority of patients. In a review of 20 patients with aggressive tumors refractory to conventional treatment, the alkylating agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> resulted in a partial response in approximately two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The use of immunohistochemical demonstration of low expression of the DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) appeared to predict responsiveness to the agent. While preliminary, these reports offer a new approach to patients with aggressive or metastatic tumors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pituitary irradiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in whom fertility is an important concern and in whom a tumor is not found or who are not cured by transsphenoidal resection of a tumor, pituitary irradiation is one of the next treatment options; it may also be considered as primary therapy for children under age 18 years. Conventional megavoltage linear accelerator after transsphenoidal surgery will correct the hypercortisolism in up to 85 percent of adults when used after debulking surgery and in 85 percent of children when used as monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Stereotactic radiotherapy provides less irradiation to neuronal tissues, but experience with this technique is limited.</p><p>Maximum benefit is usually achieved within 6 to 12 months, but may require two to three years, and during this time period hypercortisolism should be controlled with one or several adrenal enzyme inhibitors. Pituitary irradiation may also decrease the occurrence of Nelson syndrome in patients not cured by irradiation for whom adrenalectomy becomes necessary, but this has not been tested in a prospective randomized trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenalectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral total adrenalectomy with lifelong daily glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy is the final definitive cure, and may be preferred by some patients instead of radiation therapy.

In several reports, remission occurred after removal of 28 of 34, 10 of 12, and 10 of 26 pulmonary carcinoid tumors and eight of nine localized neuroendocrine or other carcinoid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Metastatic tumors cannot be treated by surgical excision.</p><p>In patients with metastases limited to the liver, after resection of the primary tumor, resection or cryoablation of the metastases or even liver transplantation may result in cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Adrenal tumors should be removed with unilateral adrenalectomy while bilateral adrenalectomy is required for bilateral micronodular and most patients with macronodular adrenal hyperplasia. The management of adrenal carcinoma is reviewed separately.

The laparoscopic approach, which can be done via either the anterior or posterior approaches, has become standard (at least for patients with adenomas &lt;6 cm in diameter). Hospital stays appear to be shorter with this approach (usually one to five days) and complications fewer, as compared with open surgery.

Postoperative glucocorticoid therapy is needed because excess cortisol secretion has suppressed corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and corticotropin (ACTH).</p><p>In patients with Cushing's syndrome due to adrenal adenomas, the recovery of normal ACTH secretion from pituitary corticotropes after prolonged inhibition may be delayed. There will be secondary atrophy of nontumorous adrenal zonae fasciculata and reticularis cells in the contralateral adrenal gland. As a result, the patient often requires glucocorticoid replacement therapy for several months to a year and sometimes even longer after resection of the tumor. The principles of glucocorticoid replacement are similar to those for patients with Cushing's disease who are cured by resection of a pituitary adenoma.</p><p>Generally, patients are given higher than normal glucocorticoid replacement intraoperatively and postoperatively to avoid symptoms and signs of acute steroid withdrawal. A dose of 150 to 200 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> equivalent if bilateral adrenalectomy is not done) may be administered by constant infusion or in divided doses intravenously over the first 24 hours after induction of anesthesia.

A taper may be achieved by decreasing each successive daily dose to 50 percent of the previous day's dose.</p><p>The patient with subclinical Cushing's syndrome with partial suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis should also be treated with perioperative glucocorticoid coverage because of the risk of adrenal insufficiency; recovery will usually be faster than for patients with severe Cushing's syndrome.
