As an example, in a single institutional experience with 43,000 patients having a monoclonal gammopathy, less than 1 percent had cold-reactive autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In the largest reported series to date, covering 89 patients, the median age at diagnosis was 72 years (range: 43 to 91), while the median age at the onset of symptoms was 65 years (range: 41 to 83). Sixty-one percent of the affected individuals were female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

These changes disappear upon warming of the part, and there is little or no reactive hyperemia, as occurs in the Raynaud phenomenon. This process may be sufficiently severe to cause ulceration of the skin.

In the former, they are usually specific for the I antigen and in the latter, the i antigen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61974 \">table 2</a>). Although low titers of these antibodies are frequently encountered in patients with these disorders, clinical manifestations of cold agglutinin syndrome occur only in those unusual cases in which the antibody titer is greatly elevated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious mononucleosis in adults and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Hemolysis'</a>.)</p><p>Less commonly, cold agglutinins are associated with other bacterial and viral diseases, such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, legionella, Citrobacter, influenza, and varicella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/4,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22</a>]. One bacterial infection, a particular strain of Listeria monocytogenes, may also cause the production of anti-I antibodies because of shared epitopes on its surface. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies#H1033389332\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;, section on 'Lewis, P1P(K), GLOB, and I blood group systems'</a>.)</p><p>When cold agglutinin production is secondary to Mycoplasma infection or infectious mononucleosis, it usually occurs approximately two weeks after the onset of the primary disease. Peak antibody titers are quickly reached and diminish as soon as the illness begins to resolve. The titer is usually back to normal three to four months after the initial occurrence. The manifestations of the primary disease often predominate, although hemolysis can be significant in some cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Laboratory abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9561671\"><span class=\"h3\">'Benign' monoclonal variant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This variant (chronic cold agglutinin syndrome) is due to a monoclonal IgM gammopathy, which usually occurs in persons &gt;60 years of age. The antibody is nearly always of anti-I in specificity and characterized by bearing kappa light chains (ie, IgM kappa). In many patients it persists without change for a number of years. However, in 5 to 10 percent of patients who present with chronic cold agglutinin syndrome, a malignant clone arises that also expresses the cold agglutinin. This may be heralded by an increasing titer of the antibody, even before the other manifestations of the disease (eg, enlarged lymph nodes, circulating malignant lymphocytes) may be manifest. The presence of trisomy 3 on chromosomal analysis of the lymphocytes may predict for this transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

There are exceptions to this rule, but the finding of an anti-i antibody in the absence of viral disease is usually a clear indication that the patient is harboring a lymphoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Whenever the cold agglutinin is the result of malignant proliferation, its concentration in the plasma may be used as a tumor marker.

The age of the patients with such tumors usually corresponds to the time of highest natural incidence of cold agglutinins (age &gt;60); it is therefore likely that the two conditions are coincidental, rather than related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anemia of cold agglutinin disease is highly variable but is usually only of moderate severity and is mainly due to extravascular hemolysis. In some cases, however, an IgG antibody accompanies the cold agglutinin (so-called &quot;mixed&quot; autoimmune hemolytic anemia), in which case the hemolytic anemia may be more severe and may also be intravascular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26</a>].

Cold agglutinins, activated by a fall in temperature either in the sample prior to counting or during cooling of the sample within the apparatus itself, will cause red blood cells (RBCs) to pass through the counter in small groups, rather than one by one, and will be counted as macrocytic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This problem is sufficiently common that spurious macrocytosis should be considered a clue to the possible presence of cold agglutinins.</p><p>There are two general ways to determine that these sorts of cold-induced artifact have occurred:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of the peripheral smear (or alternatively of a cooled RBC suspension) may confirm the presence of RBC agglutination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50522\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50522 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examination of the erythrocyte volume histograms as printed out by the automated counter may show that populations of RBCs are present with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) two to three times that of the patient's normal RBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These abnormal populations should disappear on warming of the sample to 37&deg;C before analysis if cold agglutinins are present.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1865184\"><span class=\"h3\">Reticulocyte count</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reticulocyte count is most often elevated in response to the patient's anemia. On occasion, the increase may be less than one would expect for the degree of anemia, suggesting the presence of immune-mediated destruction or apoptosis of red cell precursors, marrow suppression (eg, infection, malignancy, chemotherapy), or concomitant nutrient deficiency (eg, iron, folate, B12). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult#H2782676094\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;, section on 'Hemolysis without reticulocytosis'</a>.)</p><p>In particular, reticulocytopenia in a patient with severe anemia appears to be a feature indicating a worse prognosis, and may be an indication for the use of erythropoietin to overcome the inadequate bone marrow response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/11,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1865190\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone marrow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bone marrow usually shows erythroid hyperplasia and may show the presence of lymphoplasmacytic aggregates. The latter are often monoclonal (light chain restricted) on analysis and consist of cells that are making the antibody. When lymphoma supervenes, the aggregates may become larger and confluent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiglobulin (Coombs) test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the antiglobulin (Coombs) test, the RBCs of the patient are washed free of adherent proteins and reacted with antiserum or monoclonal antibodies prepared against the various immunoglobulins and a fragment of the third component of complement, C3d. This test is invariably positive using anti-C3 and is usually negative with anti-IgG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69817\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69817 \">table 3</a>). However, when an IgG antibody accompanies the cold agglutinin, the test may be positive with anti-IgG as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cold agglutinins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold agglutinins cause red blood cells to clump together (agglutinate), which may be visible in the blood collection tube <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> on the peripheral blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116213\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116213 \">picture 2</a>). Thus, great care must be taken in collecting blood for cold agglutinin titration; the specimen must be maintained at 37 to 40&deg;C until the clot has formed and retracted and the serum has been removed.</p><p>The titer of cold agglutinin in the serum (ie, the highest dilution of the serum sample at which agglutination of red cells in the cold is still seen) is highly variable among affected patients, but is usually quite constant for a given patient. Cold agglutinins are typically present in virtually all normal individuals in low titer (&lt;1 in 64, and usually &lt;1 in 10), with no age or seasonal variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. On the other hand, the titer in patients with cold agglutinin syndrome may reach or exceed 1 in 50,000, and is typically higher than 1 in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Hemolysis is seldom seen if the titer is less than 1 in 512, although exceptions exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In addition to the concentration of antibody, the amount of hemolysis also depends upon other factors, including the thermal amplitude of the interaction (ie, the highest temperature at which antibody and antigen are able to interact), inhibition of antibody binding by cell bound C3, and the presence of hexameric IgM antibodies. Some cold agglutinins are cryoprecipitable (ie, cryoglobulins); these antibodies generally fix C1 poorly. When cryoglobulins are present acral necrosis is sometimes seen, but hemolysis is often less than expected for the titer of antibody. Rare cold agglutinins are IgA and do not fix C1 at all.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9562072\"><span class=\"h2\">Complement levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of constant consumption, serum levels of complement proteins C3 and C4 are low in most patients with cold agglutinin disease, which may limit further extra- and intravascular hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Complement levels may rise during acute phase responses in these patients, resulting in &quot;paradoxical&quot; exacerbations of the anemia following febrile disease, trauma, or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cold-agglutinin-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of cold agglutinin disease is suspected in the patient complaining of pain and discomfort on exposure to cold as well as on swallowing cold food or liquids. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms on exposure to cold'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnosis is confirmed when all of the following are present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A peripheral blood smear showing red blood cell aggregates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F50522\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50522 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of a high titer of cold agglutinins.
