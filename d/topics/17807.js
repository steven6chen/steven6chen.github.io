The treatments of corticotropin (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiencies are in many ways the same as the treatments of primary deficiencies of the respective target glands, but in other ways they differ. Both the similarities and differences will be highlighted below. Treatment of growth hormone (GH) deficiency is unique to hypopituitarism.</p><p>The specifics of therapy for hypopituitarism will be reviewed here. The causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hypopituitarism, as well as GH deficiency in adults and the management of individual hormone deficiencies, are reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypopituitarism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypopituitarism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for hypopituitarism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone deficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTH DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary consequence of lack of corticotropin (ACTH) is cortisol deficiency. As a result, treatment consists of the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> in an amount and timing to mimic the normal pattern of cortisol secretion. Because there is no test to assess the adequacy of the replacement, the optimal doses are not known. Most authorities recommend replacement with hydrocortisone because that is the hormone the adrenal glands make normally (hydrocortisone and cortisol are different names for the same chemical structure).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17719430\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation and dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most authorities recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> doses of 15 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] because those doses are similar to daily production rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients who are more severely deficient or weigh more tend to need doses at the upper end of this range and vice versa. Some patients, however, need even larger doses to avoid severely symptomatic adrenal insufficiency, and others can get by on smaller amounts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although dividing the total daily dose into two or even three doses (with the largest dose on arising in the morning) makes sense physiologically, many patients cannot remember to take doses in the middle of the day. For them, taking the entire dose in the morning is preferable to missing doses. Most patients feel well while taking the entire dose on arising.</p><p>Whatever the preparation and dose, the patient should be instructed in the need for larger doses in times of illness, surgery, procedures, and other stresses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An inadequate dose may result in persistence (or recurrence) of the symptoms of cortisol deficiency, while an excessive dose can lead to symptoms of cortisol excess and bone loss. Small deviations from the optimal dose are usually not detected clinically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151093685\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of dose adequacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike replacement of other pituitary-dependent hormones, no tests exist to assess objectively the adequacy of the replacement of cortisol, as illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma ACTH measurements cannot be used, because the values are low or normal before treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum cortisol values vary from patient to patient and in relation to the timing of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> dose. This was illustrated in a study of 46 patients with adrenal insufficiency, 23 of whom had a secondary cause, stably treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cortisone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cortisone acetate</a>. Clinical status was assessed by a questionnaire, and serum cortisol concentrations were measured for up to eight hours after a single 25 mg dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In the 33 patients considered clinically &quot;well replaced,&quot; the serum cortisol concentrations not only fluctuated from a mean maximum of approximately 21 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> at two hours after the dose to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> six hours after the dose, but varied among individuals from &lt;14 to &gt;28 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> at two hours and from virtually undetectable to &gt;14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> at six hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salivary cortisol values also fluctuate widely and do not correlate with plasma values after oral administration. In a study of 27 patients with adrenal insufficiency, 18 of whom had a secondary cause and who were stably treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>, plasma and salivary cortisol were measured for eight hours after a single 20 mg dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The plasma concentration fluctuated widely among patients, as shown by a fivefold variation in area under the curve. The correlation between plasma and salivary cortisol was poor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary cortisol values are also unreliable for the assessment of adequacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consequently, the adequacy of the replacement dose must be judged by the much cruder clinical criteria, such as Cushingoid features when the dose is quite excessive and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when the dose is quite insufficient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8249423\"><span class=\"h2\">Subjective health status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a possible consequence of the lack of objective measurements of the adequacy of the replacement dose of glucocorticoid, patients with adrenal insufficiency have impaired self-reported health status by standard questionnaires. This was illustrated in a study of 210 patients with adrenal insufficiency, 78 of whom had a secondary cause. Scores on validated self-assessment questionnaires (SF-36, Geissen Complaint List, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) were significantly impaired compared with age- and gender-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients with secondary insufficiency were slightly more impaired than those with primary adrenal insufficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151093699\"><span class=\"h2\">Unmasking diabetes insipidus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An unusual side effect of glucocorticoid replacement is the unmasking of previously subclinical central diabetes insipidus, leading to polyuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Correction of cortisol deficiency can increase the blood pressure and renal blood flow and, in patients with partial diabetes insipidus, reduce the secretion of vasopressin. All of these effects increase urine output. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-output-in-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine output in diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151093706\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for mineralocorticoid coverage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike the situation in primary adrenal insufficiency, mineralocorticoid replacement is not necessary in hypopituitarism. Angiotensin II and potassium, not ACTH, are the major regulators of aldosterone secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151093813\"><span class=\"h2\">Adrenal androgen replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with secondary adrenal insufficiency, exogenous dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) replacement may have a small beneficial effect on psychological well-being. However, these data are from women with panhypopituitarism, who have combined ACTH and gonadotropin deficiency, and therefore adrenal and ovarian androgen deficiency. There are no data in women with isolated ACTH deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Androgen replacement (DHEA)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TSH DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency results in thyroxine (T4) deficiency and is treated with T4 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>). The factors that influence dosing are similar to those of primary hypothyroidism. However, treatment of secondary hypothyroidism differs in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T4 should <strong>not</strong> be administered until adrenal function, including corticotropin (ACTH) reserve, has been evaluated and either found to be normal or treated. In a patient with coexisting hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism, treatment of the hypothyroidism alone may increase the clearance of the little cortisol that is produced, thereby increasing the severity of the cortisol deficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of serum TSH cannot be used as a guide to the adequacy of T4 replacement. We suggest starting with a weight-based T4 dose of 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span>. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommends adjusting the dose to maintain the serum free T4 concentration in the upper half of the reference range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. We suggest that the goal should be a serum T4 level slightly higher than mid-normal, based on the rationale that only T4 is being given. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-hypothyroidism#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">LH AND FSH DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency depends upon gender and whether or not fertility is desired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Testosterone</a> replacement is indicated in men who have secondary hypogonadism and are not interested in fertility. The choice of treatment does not differ from that in men with primary hypogonadism. The adequacy of treatment should be determined by measuring serum testosterone, not LH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-treatment-of-male-hypogonadism#H165683108\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testosterone treatment of male hypogonadism&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>Men with secondary hypogonadism who wish to become fertile can be treated with gonadotropins if they have pituitary disease or with either gonadotropins or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) if they have hypothalamic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of fertility in men with secondary hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with hypogonadism due to pituitary disease who are not interested in fertility should be treated with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy. The goal of treatment is <strong>not</strong> the same as in postmenopausal women, in whom the goal is to give estrogen and progestin only if necessary to relieve hot flashes. Instead, the goal of treatment of women of premenopausal age is similar to that of replacement of thyroxine (T4) and cortisol, ie, to replace the missing hormones as physiologically as possible.</p><p>Toward this end, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> (the estrogen the human ovaries secrete) transdermally, so estradiol is absorbed into the systemic circulation (as when it is secreted by the ovaries). Women with an intact uterus must also take a progestin to avoid the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma. We also recommend that estradiol be administered cyclically with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> or a progestin. Some clinicians suggest a traditional regimen of estradiol on days 1 through 25 of each month and progesterone on days 16 through 25 of each month. The goals are to achieve both a normal late-follicular serum estradiol concentration and menses the patient considers normal. Another regimen is to give transdermal estradiol continuously throughout the month, with progestin added days 1 to 10 of the calendar month. This regimen is similar to that used for treatment of premature ovarian failure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;</a>). For women who develop cyclic mood changes (premenstrual syndrome) on either of these regimens, a continuous daily regimen of both estrogen and a lower dose of progestin is usually better tolerated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-premenstrual-syndrome-and-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women with secondary hypogonadism who wish to become fertile should be offered ovulation induction. Women with GnRH deficiency are candidates for either gonadotropin therapy or pulsatile GnRH, while those with gonadotropin deficiency due to pituitary disease are candidates only for gonadotropin therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ovulation-induction#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ovulation induction&quot;, section on 'Gonadotropin therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151093784\"><span class=\"h3\">Androgen replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum androgen concentrations in women with hypopituitarism, particularly those with both gonadotropin and corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency, are significantly lower than those in normal control women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Adrenal androgen replacement is discussed above. The role of exogenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> therapy in these women is unclear, but it is not recommended.</p><p>The effect of exogenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testosterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">testosterone</a> therapy in women with androgen deficiency due to hypopituitarism was addressed in a study of 51 such patients taking exogenous estrogen orally. Testosterone replacement was administered transdermally at doses of 150 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> for one year, resulting in serum free testosterone concentrations in the normal range and increased mean bone mineral density of the hip and radius, but not the spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other effects included an increase in fat-free mass and thigh muscle area, and improvements in some aspects of mood, sexual function, and quality of life, as assessed by questionnaires. One-third of the women receiving testosterone developed acne, but no patients developed hirsutism or other hyperandrogenic side effects. Androgen therapy in women is discussed in more detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-hormone-deficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth hormone deficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The availability of several recombinant human GH preparations for treating adults with GH deficiency allows clinicians to prescribe this treatment. Patients with GH deficiency acquired as an adult must, to be reimbursed by insurance companies in the United States, meet at least two criteria for therapy: a low insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentration or a poor GH response to at least two standard stimuli, and hypopituitarism due to pituitary or hypothalamic damage. The criteria are different in children in whom GH is required for normal growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-growth-hormone-deficiency-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of growth hormone deficiency in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PROLACTIN DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only known presentation of prolactin deficiency is the inability to lactate after delivery, for which there is currently no available treatment. Recombinant human prolactin (r-hPRL), although not commercially available, has been used experimentally in an open-label, pilot study of five women with prolactin deficiency due to Sheehan syndrome or other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Prolactin deficiency was defined as baseline or peak serum prolactin levels below the normal range for their postpartum date and production of less than 8 mL of milk per day. Subcutaneous administration of r-hPRL every 12 hours for 28 days increased mean milk production from 3.4&plusmn;1.6 mL to 66.1&plusmn;8.3 mL per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
