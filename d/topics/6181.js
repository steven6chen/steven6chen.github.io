Invasion of the central nervous system (meningitis or meningoencephalitis) and bacteremia are the principal clinical manifestations of listerial infection in these hosts. In contrast, normal hosts who ingest high numbers of <em>Listeria</em> may develop self-limited febrile gastroenteritis.</p><p>The epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of listerial infection will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of listerial infections are discussed separately.

On Gram stain, <em>Listeria</em> may resemble pneumococci (diplococci), enterococci, or diphtheroids (Corynebacteria) or be gram variable and be confused with <em>Haemophilus</em> species (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79633\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79633 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. In particular, when a positive blood or cerebrospinal fluid culture is preliminarily identified as diphtheroids, the clinician should consider the possibility that the isolate represents <em>Listeria</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p><em>Listeria</em> produces a characteristic appearance on blood agar with small zones of clear beta-hemolysis around each colony (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57140\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57140 \">picture 3</a>). <em>Listeria</em> grows well at refrigeration temperatures (4&deg; to 10&deg;C). Rarely, the &quot;cold enrichment&quot; technique and selective media are used when attempting to isolate <em>Listeria</em> from mixed cultures, such as stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Listeria </em>is a facultative intracellular parasite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The primary habitat of <em>Listeria</em> is the soil and decaying vegetable matter. Most <em>Listeria</em> infections in adults are thought to result from oral ingestion and subsequent intestinal mucosal penetration and systemic infection.</p><p>Immunity to <em>Listeria</em> relies mainly on T cell lymphokine activation of macrophages, which clear <em>Listeria</em> from the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Interleukin (IL)-18 appears to play a role in protection against <em>Listeria</em> by enhancing bacterial clearance, even in the absence of interferon (IFN)-gamma, and by stimulating macrophages to secrete tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. On the other hand, factors that impair macrophage survival or function are associated with increased susceptibility to listerial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>There is increasing evidence that IFN signaling enhances susceptibility to <em>L. monocytogenes</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Mice deficient in either IFN regulatory factor or the IFN receptor are profoundly resistant to infection caused by <em>L. monocytogenes</em> compared with wild-type mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p><em>Listeria</em> can initially enter cells by a mechanism that may involve binding of a bacterial protein (internalin) to E-cadherin (CDH1) on the host cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Another possible mechanism is via LapB, a sortase A&ndash;anchored surface protein that may be necessary for adhesion to and entry into mammalian cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The organism then uses a unique mechanism of spreading from cell to cell without exposing itself to an extracellular environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It accomplishes this by subverting the actin-based cellular contractile mechanism; propulsion within the cytoplasm of infected host cells and cell-to-cell spread are thought to be driven by actin polymerization at the bacterial cell surface and the formation of a comet tail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Both protein components in the host cell cytoplasm (particularly profilin, a host actin monomer-binding protein) and a bacterial surface protein (called ActA) are required for actin assembly by <em>Listeria</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p><em>Listeria</em> has a predilection for the placenta and the central nervous system. How this occurs is not well understood. <em>Listeria</em> crosses the placenta during maternal bacteremia and infects the fetus.

It induces T cell receptor (TCR) unresponsiveness by driving the expression of negative regulators of TCR signaling and suppresses antigen-induced T cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, listeriolysin O impairs posttranslational modification of host cell proteins and interferes with the host immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p><em>L. monocytogenes</em> genotype sequence type 6 has been associated with unfavorable outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Approximately 0.8 to 3.4 percent of healthy individuals are fecal excretors of <em>Listeria</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In adults &ge;65 years of age, the incidence was 1.3 cases per 100,000 population, and, in pregnant women, the incidence was 3.0 cases per 100,000 population. The highest incidence was observed in pregnant Hispanic women (7.0 cases per 100,000 population).</p><p>A study of foodborne illness in the United States between 2000 and 2008 estimated that 1600 cases of listeriosis occur annually, with a 16 percent reported mortality rate (approximately 255 deaths) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Among foodborne infections in the United States, <em>Listeria</em> has the third highest mortality rate (approximately 16 percent compared with 35 percent with <em>Vibrio vulnificus</em> and 17 percent with botulism) and accounts for approximately 19 percent of all deaths from foodborne infection. However, it should be noted that mortality rates are often subject to reporting bias. Since it is more likely that severe or fatal cases are reported and that mild cases are unreported, the actual case-fatality rate is probably lower than 16 percent. Nonperinatal listeriosis-associated deaths in the United States have decreased from 1990 to 2005, paralleling the decreasing trend in incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>An increasing rate of listeriosis has been reported in several European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Decreased concentration of salt in prepared foods has been proposed as a possible cause of this trend. In a study from England, an association between living in a socioeconomically depressed neighborhood and becoming ill with listeriosis was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Among 249 cases of culture-confirmed cases of listeriosis in nine states between 2000 and 2003, 95 percent were sporadic. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Food epidemiology and outbreaks'</a> below.)</p><p>Sporadic gastroenteritis due to <em>L. monocytogenes</em> appears to be an uncommon illness as illustrated in a two-year population-based survey of stool specimens submitted for evaluation of diarrheal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. <em>Listeria</em> spp were recovered in only 39 of 7775 (0.5 percent) stool specimens. Thus, routine screening of stool samples for <em>Listeria</em> is unwarranted.</p><p>The source of infection in sporadic cases is usually not known, but most cases are thought to be secondary to ingestion of contaminated food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/3,4,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,29-31</a>].

Infections from animal contact are uncommon, primarily occurring in veterinarians, abattoir workers, and farmers.</p><p>The following observations illustrate the range of findings: two were from the Listeria Study Group involving patients seen between 1988 and 1990 and one was from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case-control study of 165 patients with culture-confirmed sporadic listeriosis from the Listeria Study Group, 32 percent of cases could be attributed to eating soft cheeses or foods purchased from delicatessen counters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Almost 70 percent of patients were immunosuppressed (cancer, HIV infection, organ transplant recipient, or glucocorticoid therapy); among these patients, undercooked chicken also increased the risk of listeriosis.

In this study, 169 patients with sporadic listeriosis were matched to 376 controls. In multivariable analysis, <em>L. monocytogenes</em> infection was linked to two previously unrecognized foods: eating melons at a commercial establishment or hummus prepared in a commercial establishment.</p><p/><p>There are, however, limitations to such case-control studies: only foods associated with a marked elevation in relative risk (RR) can be identified, multiple testing may lead to false-positive results, and contaminated foods to which exposure is either rare or common may be missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Methods used to prevent foodborne infection are described elsewhere.
