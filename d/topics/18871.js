In 1970, it was known by the descriptive term fibroxanthogranulomatous cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but in 1981 the name xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis was proposed in a review of 40 cases from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Its importance lies in the fact that it is a benign condition that may be confused with carcinoma of the gallbladder, which is associated with a poor prognosis.</p><p>Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis was initially described as a variant of chronic cholecystitis. However, while the latter is usually regarded as a benign condition with questionable clinical significance, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is an active and destructive process that can lead to significant morbidity as the inflammatory process usually extends into the gallbladder wall and adjacent structures. Thus, it should be considered a distinct clinical entity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis among patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease ranges from 0.7 percent in the United States to up to 10 percent in India and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. The mean age at presentation varies in different studies from 44 to 63 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. A study from India reported a 1:9 male to female ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], while in other reports the male to female ratio ranged from 2:1 to 1:2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/3,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is thought to be related to extravasation of bile into the gallbladder wall from rupture of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses or by mucosal ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. This event incites an inflammatory reaction in the interstitial tissue, whereby fibroblasts and macrophages phagocytose the biliary lipids in bile, such as cholesterol and phospholipids leading to the formation of xanthoma cells.</p><p>Gallstones may have an important role in the pathogenesis, since they appear to be present in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/4,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,11</a>]. It has been suggested that xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is analogous to xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, which results from obstruction and stasis due to renal calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=xanthogranulomatous-pyelonephritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On gross examination, the gallbladder is thickened and the serosa is covered with dense fibrous adhesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67995\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67995 \">picture 1</a>). The mucosal surface may be ulcerated and cross sections through the wall reveal xanthogranulomatous foci, which appear as yellow nodules or plaques. These yellowish foci may extend into adjacent structures, such as the liver, duodenum, transverse colon, and omentum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>].</p><p>Microscopically, the xanthogranulomatous foci are composed of abundant lipid laden macrophages, fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75696\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75696 \">picture 2</a>). The lipid laden macrophages are of two morphological types: rounded foamy macrophages and spindle-shaped cells with more granular cytoplasm and elongated nuclei. Other findings include the presence of cholesterol clefts, lipid droplets, hemosiderin deposits, and extravasated bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The relationship between xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis and gallbladder carcinoma is uncertain. Focal granulomatous changes were seen deep within the gallbladder wall in association with neoplastic invasion in a study of five patients, suggesting a possible relationship between both entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Another study found adenocarcinoma in nearly 10 percent of resected specimens of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], while in a larger study no such relationship was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical patient has a history suggestive of an episode of acute cholecystitis and occasionally may present with clinical and radiological features that mimic carcinoma of the gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a review of 13 cases from the United Kingdom, 11 patients (85 percent) experienced at least one episode of acute cholecystitis, which was the first presenting symptom in six patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One patient presented with acute pancreatitis and others had symptoms suggestive of biliary pain. In another series, obstructive jaundice was observed in 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Obstructive jaundice is caused by choledocholithiasis or compression of the common bile duct by the inflamed gallbladder (Mirizzi syndrome). In a study that compared patients with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis with and without associated cancer, those with cancer were more likely to present with anorexia, weight loss, palpable mass, and jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Biliary strictures in association with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (xanthogranulomatous choledochitis) have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Physical examination is usually unremarkable except possibly for a positive Murphy's sign when acute cholecystitis is present. A right hypochondrial mass may be more common in xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis than in acute cholecystitis, mimicking carcinoma of the gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a fairly high incidence of complications in xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, amounting to more than 30 percent in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Local complications in the gallbladder include perforation and the development of strictures. Prolonged cystic duct obstruction and gallbladder distension under pressure during the acute inflammatory phase can lead to extension of the xanthogranulomatous inflammation beyond the gallbladder with formation of hepatic abscesses and fistulas into adjacent structures, such as the liver, duodenum, stomach, colon, and skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A case of associated Mirizzi syndrome has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirizzi-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mirizzi syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is usually made by histological examination of the resected gallbladder. The possibility of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis should be considered in any patient presenting with a right upper quadrant mass <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a biliary fistula. There are no consistent trends in biochemical or hematological findings that aid in the diagnosis. Imaging studies and fine needle aspiration cytology may be suggestive, but no reports on their utility exist. Confirmatory diagnosis is made only at surgery, sometimes requiring a frozen section.</p><p>A major challenge in the management of patients with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is the distinction from gallbladder cancer. In a study that evaluated 4800 cholecystectomies performed over a fifteen-year period, 453 were diagnosed with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Of these 453 patients, 26 (6 percent) had associated gallbladder carcinoma. Both preoperative and perioperative fine-needle aspiration cytology failed to reveal associated cancer in some patients. In another study of 566 patients with a gallbladder mass that was suspected to be malignant, 198 were deemed resectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Of these, 31 patients were diagnosed intraoperatively with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, and 25 of these patients required radical resection. In a study of 142 patients with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, 42 were misdiagnosed as gallbladder cancer based on preoperative radiographs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraoperative findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The accuracy rate of frozen section analysis and that of the surgeon's macroscopic diagnosis were 93 and 50 percent, respectively. These reports highlight the clinical challenges in establishing a correct preoperative or intraoperative diagnosis in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography often shows a thickened gallbladder wall (which may be focal or diffuse) with gallstones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/15,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20,21</a>]. In a series of 26 patients, the most characteristic finding was the presence of hypoechoic nodules or bands in the gallbladder wall, which were present in 35 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Other findings on ultrasonography include a gallbladder mass, subhepatic fluid collection, obscure border between the gallbladder and liver, intramural hypoechoic nodules, and rarely, gas in the biliary tree in patients with a biliary fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, although the above findings are suggestive of the diagnosis, none is diagnostic, and it may not be possible to distinguish the gallbladder wall thickening of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis from gallbladder carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/7,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22</a>]. Furthermore, some of the findings, such as intramural hypoechoic nodules, can be seen in other conditions, including intramural abscesses, cholesterolosis, and adenomyomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-polyps-and-cholesterolosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder polyps and cholesterolosis&quot;</a>.) In a study that evaluated the utility of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in 17 patients with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis and 43 patients with gallbladder cancer, contrast-enhanced ultrasound was more accurate than transabdominal ultrasound in diagnosing xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A continuous inner wall, hypoenhancement times greater than 80.5 seconds, diffuse thickening, and hypoechoic nodules were indicators of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Computerized tomography (CT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A retrospective review of the CT findings in 11 patients with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis revealed intramural hypodense nodules in all patients, diffuse gallbladder wall thickening in 91 percent, and gallstones in 64 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The area occupied by these nodules in the thickened gallbladder was inversely proportional to the duration of symptoms, which may be due to the presence of active necrotic centers in newer xanthogranulomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54177\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54177 \">image 1</a>). Extension of the inflammatory process into the liver was noted in 45 percent of patients; a similar observation was made in an earlier report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The most specific CT finding in a review of 26 patients was a hypodense band in the gallbladder wall, which was seen in 33 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A study involving 18 patients correlated CT and MR findings with pathologic findings in xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Low-attenuation areas in the wall of the gallbladder correlated with foam and inflammatory cells or necrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abscess in xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. Areas of iso- to slightly high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, showing slight enhancement at early phase and strong enhancement at last phase on dynamic study, corresponded with areas of abundant xanthogranulomas. Areas with very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images without enhancement corresponded with necrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abscesses.</p><p>The CT scan features of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis and carcinoma of the gallbladder are similar. In one study, only the presence of intramural hypoattenuated nodules occupying an area greater than 60 percent of the thickened gallbladder had statistically significant specificity for the diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective study that compared the CT features of 18 patients with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis and 17 patients with gallbladder cancer, five CT findings showed significant differences between both disease entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The five findings that were predictive of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse gallbladder wall thickening: sensitivity 89 percent, specificity 65 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous mucosal line: sensitivity 67 percent, specificity 82 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intramural hypoattenuated nodules: sensitivity 61 percent, specificity 71 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of macroscopic hepatic invasion: sensitivity 72 percent, specificity 77 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation: sensitivity 67 percent, specificity 71 percent</p><p/><p>When at least three of these five CT findings were observed, the sensitivity and specificity were 83 and 100 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H282566145\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on the accuracy of MRI in diagnosing xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis are limited. In a series that included seven patients with nine nodules who underwent MRI, intramural nodules appeared to have higher signal intensity on in-phase images than in out-of-phase images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In another report with 19 patients, the addition of diffusion-weighted MRI enabled better differentiation of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis from gallbladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Diffusion restriction was more apparent in wall-thickening type of gallbladder cancer, and the apparent diffusion coefficient was higher for xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis than for cancer. More data are required before MRI can be recommended as a diagnostic tool for identifying xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholecystography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral and intravenous cholecystography are nonspecific and generally fail to delineate the gallbladder due to obstructing cystic duct stones in a majority of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Fine needle aspiration cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology is useful for the diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis since it can help to differentiate the disorder from gallbladder carcinoma, and thus assist in planning a surgical intervention. This was illustrated in a review of 17 patients with histologically proven xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis who underwent fine needle aspiration cytology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The presence of histiocytes, foam cells, multinucleate giant cells, bile, and a mixed population of inflammatory cells in varying proportions on a background of pink, granular debris was felt to be characteristic of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. However, the nuclear pleomorphism in histiocytes seen in xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis can also be seen in malignancy. Furthermore, coexisting malignancy cannot always be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Fine needle aspiration biopsy can lead to fistula formation.

The general principles for the management of acute cholecystitis should be followed in patients who present with acute cholecystitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>During surgery, a markedly thick-walled gallbladder with extensive, dense, fibrous adhesions to neighboring structures should raise the suspicion for xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. A frozen section or a fine needle aspirate is usually necessary to establish the diagnosis before the case is deemed to be an unresectable malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/9,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,35</a>].</p><p>Because of the inflammatory and invasive nature of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, a complete resection of adjacent xanthogranulomatous tissue should be attempted, even if this includes resection into the hepatic bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/15,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,36</a>]. A preoperative cholangiogram should always be performed, since adenocarcinoma of the bile duct in association with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Open cholecystectomy is the preferred surgical technique in most patients due to dense fibrosis, extensive local inflammation, and concerns of possible coexistent malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In a study of 27 patients with xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis in whom laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted, 19 percent required conversion to the open method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The presence of dense fibrosis and coexistent adenocarcinoma were the most common reasons that precluded a laparoscopic approach. An even higher rate of conversion to open surgery (80 percent) has been described by another group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/xanthogranulomatous-cholecystitis/abstract/7,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Morbidity following resection of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is largely related to postoperative complications.
