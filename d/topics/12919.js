The foreskin is a physiologic covering for the glans penis. The foreskin functions to physically and immunologically protect the glans penis and external urethral orifice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraphimosis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It may also function to provide increased male stimulation and lubrication during sexual intercourse.</p><p>At birth, the foreskin and glans penis are fused, and the foreskin is not retractable, causing a physiologic phimosis. The epithelial cells of the inner surface of the foreskin desquamate forming white pearly masses, called smegma. The foreskin becomes more retractable with time as the creation of the space between the glans penis and inner foreskin develops.

Impairment of lymphatic and venous flow from the constricting ring of foreskin causes venous engorgement of the glans penis with swelling.

Pain, swelling, and edema of the distal penis and foreskin may occur with a constriction of the proximal penis and appears similar to paraphimosis. A careful inspection at the normal to abnormal interface of the penis will reveal the constricting hair and may require magnification to visualize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraphimosis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Rarely, such bands may be intentionally placed on the young as an abusive event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraphimosis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Causative agents include bed bugs, chiggers, mosquitoes, fleas, spiders, and hymenoptera (eg, bees, wasps).
