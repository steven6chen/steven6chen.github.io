For some patients being considered as candidates for lung transplant, pre-existing pleural disease may increase their risk of postoperative pleural complications. Even in the absence of pre-existing pleural disease, pleural complications following lung transplantation are common due to disruption of the pleural space at the time of transplant surgery, complications related to rejection of the allograft, and the immunosuppression regimen post-transplant.</p><p>The risk factors for pleural complications and the postoperative pleural complications that develop in patients undergoing lung transplantation will be reviewed here. Issues regarding the selection of candidates for lung transplantation and the physiologic changes that occur following lung transplantation are discussed separately.

At the time of lung transplantation, a recipient's native lung must be completely removed from that thoracic cavity. Pleural adhesions may make it much more difficult to remove the native lung, increasing operative time and placing the patient at increased risk for intraoperative bleeding. </p><p>Pre-existing pleural space abnormalities may be secondary to many different etiologies, such as prior pneumothorax, hemothorax, chylothorax, empyema, or pleural adhesions. Underlying suppurative lung disease and prior surgical lung biopsy can lead to pleural adhesions. In addition, treatment of these pleural space diseases by the placement of chest tubes, pleurodesis, or pleurectomy may further contribute to pleural space abnormalities that may complicate lung transplantation. </p><p>Special consideration may be needed in candidates with underlying diseases that are prone to cause pleural adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].

However, a few small series are at least partially reassuring in this regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/3,4,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6-9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small series, 16 patients with CF who had a history of pleural interventions to manage pneumothoraces were compared with 16 patients with CF without prior pneumothorax and 16 patients with non-CF lung disease and no history of pneumothorax or pleural procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Twenty patients had moderate to severe intraoperative hemorrhage related to adhesion lysis, but no intraoperative deaths were reported. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A separate report described the experience with 41 patients with LAM; severe intraoperative hemorrhage due to lysis of extensive adhesions occurred in 21 patients and 13 patients required intraoperative cardiopulmonary bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of lung transplant recipients suggests that pre-existing pleural disease (defined as pleural thickening, plaque, or fibrosis) may be associated with an increased risk of primary graft dysfunction at 0 and 48 hours and worse short term (three month) outcomes, although there was no significant difference in overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4024962165\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor-recipient size mismatches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In certain situations, a lung transplant recipient may receive a donor lung that is smaller than the recipient's native lung. This size discrepancy is a risk factor for pleural complications, such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and empyema, postoperatively. Two specific situations in which size mismatch is likely to occur include adult lung transplant recipients receiving pediatric donor lungs and living donor lobar transplant recipients. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult lung transplant recipients receiving pediatric donor lungs &ndash; Size mismatching, particularly at the sites of the vascular and bronchial anastomoses, can predispose recipients to hemothorax due to bleeding at the vascular anastomosis and empyema due to leakage at the bronchial anastomotic site. The undersized lung can leave a residual pleural space with persistent pneumothorax or accumulation of pleural fluid to fill the space, both of which may require thoracentesis or chest tube reinsertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As an example, in a series of 38 adult recipients of pediatric lung allografts, 10 required chest tube reinsertion for persistent pneumothorax, pleural fluid, or empyema, and four required thoracentesis for recurrent pleural effusion prior to discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living donor lobar transplant recipients &ndash; Similar to adult recipients who receive pediatric donor lungs, recipients of living lobar lung transplantation are likely to have size discrepancies at the site of the vascular and bronchial anastomoses, and also to have smaller overall lung volumes, placing them at increased risk of pleural space complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3990413852\"><span class=\"h1\">PLEURAL COMPLICATIONS FOLLOWING LUNG TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pleural complications including pleural effusion, hemothorax, and pneumothorax are very common complications following lung transplantation. Most often, these occur in the first couple of weeks after lung transplantation, but they occasionally occur later post-transplant. Rarely, empyema, chylothorax or malignant pleural effusions may occur. The development of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) in the late post-transplant period is being increasingly recognized as a potential manifestation of Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1911038007\"><span class=\"h2\">Pleural effusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pleural effusions are very common in the early post-transplant period. Pleural effusions are also observed later post-transplant, but due to different etiologies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385378556\"><span class=\"h3\">Pleural effusions early post-transplant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the early post-lung transplant period, the most likely contributing factors to the accumulation of pleural fluid include increased alveolar capillary permeability, because of allograft ischemia, denervation, and subsequent reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and disruption of lymphatic flow due to severance of allograft lung lymphatics. It has been reported that 100 percent of lung transplant recipients have pleural effusions post-transplant. As an example, in one series of 100 patients, all had ipsilateral pleural effusions after lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thus, all patients have chest tubes in place postoperatively to drain the pleural space and diuretics are commonly utilized to try to reduce pleural fluid accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Postoperative pleural effusions are usually small to moderate in size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53151\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53151 \">image 1</a>), but rarely can be massive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Most resolve with thoracostomy tube drainage within 14 days following transplantation, although a small percentage may increase in size over the first three postoperative weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Most cells in the effusion are of recipient origin, with donor cells accounting for less than 1 percent of the total pleural cell count by the eighth postoperative day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The characteristics of pleural effusions without clinical evidence of infection or rejection have been studied following single lung transplant in nine patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The pleural fluid was initially bloody, exudative, and neutrophil-predominant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65922\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65922 \">figure 1</a>). Over the next seven days, the percentage of neutrophils and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration decreased, while the percentage of macrophages and lymphocytes rose. Resolution of daily pleural fluid output generally paralleled a decrease in pulmonary edema. </p><p>Pleural effusions also may result from abnormalities of the pulmonary venous anastomosis, including stenosis, kinking, or thrombosis. These abnormalities may cause unilateral or bilateral pulmonary edema with pleural effusions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4211197448\"><span class=\"h3\">Pleural effusions late post-transplant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late post-transplant pleural effusions can occur in association with acute cellular rejection, trapped lung from prior pleural inflammation, or malignancy. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute cellular rejection</strong> &ndash; Analysis of pleural effusions associated with acute cellular rejection in post-transplant recipients has revealed that the fluid is exudative and often contains more than 90 percent lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Pleural effusions may occur with acute lung rejection. However, the presence of a pleural effusion detected by chest computed tomography (CT) has poor sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the diagnosis of acute lung rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A small to moderate sized pleural effusion associated with acute cellular rejection will usually improve within one to two days of treatment of the rejection. The evaluation and treatment of acute lung transplant rejection is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of acute lung transplant rejection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pleural effusions that do not spontaneously resolve within a short period of time, often require drainage as a subset of these effusions can become loculated. The risk of additional procedures and chest tube drainage must be balanced with the risk that development of lung entrapment might necessitate reoperation for decortication if a fibrothorax results. Pleurodesis via thoracostomy tube is not recommended in these patients as their immunosuppressed status blunts the inflammatory response to agents such as talc or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> and places them at increased risk of empyema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. One case series of nine lung transplant recipients with refractory pleural effusions found that an indwelling pleural catheter was a successful management strategy for lung transplant recipients with lung entrapment that failed to respond to conventional tube thoracostomy drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-pleural-causes-of-unexpandable-lung\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of pleural causes of unexpandable lung&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malignancy</strong> &ndash; Lung transplant recipients are at increased risk of developing malignancies due to long-term immunosuppressive medication. Pleural metastases and primary pleural mesothelioma may manifest as a pleural effusion, which is often hemorrhagic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Pleural effusion is an uncommon manifestation of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninfectious-complications-following-lung-transplantation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninfectious complications following lung transplantation&quot;, section on 'Malignancy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary venous anastomosis stenosis or thrombosis</strong> &ndash; Although these pulmonary venous anastomosis problems typically occur in the immediate postoperative period, pleural effusions from pulmonary venous abnormalities have been reported more than one year after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1139235156\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemothorax typically occurs in the immediate postoperative period. Lung transplant recipients are at increased risk for hemothorax given the need for dissection of vascular adhesions to remove the native lung, which can often result in surface oozing; cardiopulmonary bypass with anticoagulation further increases the risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Close observation of output from the thoracostomy tubes in the immediate postoperative period is important. When significant blood output is observed, spontaneous cessation is unlikely and the risk of retained blood in the pleural space is an important consideration that must be weighed with risks of another surgical procedure and the likelihood of identifying a source of bleeding that can be addressed with early reoperation. &#160; </p><p>Up to 15 percent of lung transplant recipients have been found to have residual blood in the pleural space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. Retained blood or a residual hemothorax can serve as a nidus for infection or lead to additional pleural complications such as trapped lung or fibrothorax.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185332375\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumothoraces post-transplant may occur in a variety of settings: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Undersized donor lung</strong> &ndash; Initially post-transplant, the implanted donor lung size may be smaller than the thoracic cavity, thus resulting in residual air in the pleural space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These pneumothoraces are usually small, clinically insignificant, and resolve within days to a few weeks. By one week post-transplant, there appears to be no significant difference in pleural complications between recipients of undersized lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a case series, negative pressure drainage of the pleural space in recipients with undersized donor lungs and poor chest wall compliance resulted in detrimental effects (eg, hyperinflation, decreased elastic recoil, increased airway pressure) during positive pressure ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, complete evacuation of residual air in the pleural space in recipients with undersized donor lungs may not be necessary and may be deleterious. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anastomotic leak</strong> &ndash; A pneumothorax may result from air leaking from the site of the bronchial or tracheal anastomosis. Any significant air leak should be carefully evaluated by flexible bronchoscopy for dehiscence at the site of the airway anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Approximately 10 percent of lung transplant recipients have an air-leak lasting more than two weeks after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Virtually all of these air-leaks resolve with tube thoracostomy alone and require no further intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, rarely a pneumothorax may result from dehiscence of the bronchial anastomosis. This is a more serious complication, often requiring urgent intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway complications after lung transplantation&quot;, section on 'Bronchial necrosis and dehiscence'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Iatrogenic complications</strong> &ndash; Lung transplant recipients often undergo multiple bronchoscopic procedures usually with transbronchial biopsies to assess for rejection. A pneumothorax is a well described complication of these procedures, although it may occur less frequently than expected because of postoperative pleural adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; Superimposed pathology, such as invasive fungal disease or other lung infection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disease in the native lung</strong> &ndash; A pneumothorax may develop due to underlying emphysema or other processes in the native lung of a patient who underwent single lung transplant, especially in patients with obstructive or cystic lung disease. These secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces are rarely treated successfully with tube thoracostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Both thoracoscopic talc poudrage and thoracoscopic parietal pleurectomy have been successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3490501961\"><span class=\"h2\">Empyema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pleural space infections or empyemas complicate about 3 to 7 percent of lung transplantations, and approximately one-quarter of pleural effusions that develop within 90 days of lung transplantation are infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/14,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,36,37</a>]. Lung transplant recipients may have a blunted clinical presentation of empyema as a result of their immunosuppressed status, and thus a high clinical suspicion is required for all patients. Pleural fluid analysis should therefore always include bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures, fungal and mycobacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as cell count, LDH, protein, glucose, and triglycerides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/15,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,38</a>].

An experimental study of heart-lung transplants shed some light on the mechanisms that may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Pleural fibrosis developed in animals who received allografts but not in those who received autografts (their own heart-lung bloc). This observation suggests that chronic rejection, not the surgery, was responsible for the pleural fibrosis. More recently, a restrictive phenotype of CLAD has been recognized to be characterized by (sub)pleural thickening on chest CT scan and pathologic findings of pleural fibrosis and pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. On computed tomography, the features of pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis include pleural thickening and adjacent areas of subpleural consolidation, often with an upper lobe predominance. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1416982286\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPLEURAL COMMUNICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpleural communication can be a consequence of heart-lung transplantation (HLT) and sequential bilateral lung transplantation performed through bilateral anterolateral thoracotomies and transverse sternotomy (clam-shell) due to severing of the anterior pleural reflections.

This phenomenon persists for more than two years after HLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>] and is most likely permanent. </p><p>Awareness of the interpleural communication after transplantation is important because pleural disease in these recipients must be managed aggressively.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empyemas need to be diagnosed early and drained promptly, so that infected pleural contents do not contaminate the contralateral pleural space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tension pneumothorax in such recipients is likely to be bilateral and therefore life-threatening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single thoracostomy tube may be sufficient to drain bilateral pneumothoraces when an interpleural communication is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pleural-complications-in-lung-transplantation/abstract/23,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1177542530\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-existing pleural space abnormalities can place lung transplant recipients at increased risk for pleural complications, especially bleeding due to lysis of adhesions at the time of surgery. However, the overall long-term outcome of lung transplantation does not appear to be adversely affected by a previous pleural disease or interventions. Donor size mismatch can lead to pleural problems such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion, and empyema. (See <a href=\"#H4251439829\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for pleural complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following lung transplantation, pleural effusions have been reported in up to 100 percent of patients. Potential causes include increased alveolar capillary permeability (because of allograft ischemia, denervation, and subsequent reperfusion) and disruption of lymphatic flow due to severance of allograft lung lymphatics. Most postoperative pleural effusions resolve within 14 days with tube thoracostomy drainage. (See <a href=\"#H1911038007\" class=\"local\">'Pleural effusions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent or recurrent pleural effusions may develop post lung transplant, associated with acute cellular rejection. These effusions are typically exudative and lymphocytic (eg, 90 percent lymphocytes). (See <a href=\"#H1911038007\" class=\"local\">'Pleural effusions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of acute lung transplant rejection&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally, pleural effusions in lung transplant recipients may become loculated leading to entrapment of the lung allograft. Management may require drainage with thoracostomy tube, indwelling pleural catheter, or rarely surgical decortication if a fibrothorax develops. (See <a href=\"#H1911038007\" class=\"local\">'Pleural effusions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemothorax can occur in the immediate postoperative period and is usually due to bleeding from adhesions that were lysed when the native lung was removed or from coagulopathy. Blood should be evacuated from the pleural space as completely as possible to avoid compromise of ventilation or later problems with lung entrapment. Early reoperation may be required to stop pleural bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H1139235156\" class=\"local\">'Hemothorax'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumothoraces can result from a variety of etiologies from anastomotic leaks to iatrogenic complications of procedures. Most immediate post-transplant pneumothoraces resolved within a few days to weeks, however a significant air leak should prompt rapid evaluation for anastomotic dehiscence. (See <a href=\"#H185332375\" class=\"local\">'Pneumothorax'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-complications-after-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway complications after lung transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Empyema has been associated with increased mortality in post lung transplant recipients, and a high clinical suspicion is required in the evaluation of these immunosuppressed patients. (See <a href=\"#H3490501961\" class=\"local\">'Empyema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interpleural communication is typically present after heart-lung transplantation and after sequential bilateral lung transplantation performed through bilateral anterolateral thoracotomies or transverse sternotomy (clam-shell). The significance of this communication is that a tension pneumothorax is likely to be bilateral and pleural space infection can be transmitted to the contralateral side. (See <a href=\"#H1416982286\" class=\"local\">'Interpleural communication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural fibrosis and pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis have been recognized as a manifestation of a phenotype of chronic lung rejection described as restrictive Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD).
