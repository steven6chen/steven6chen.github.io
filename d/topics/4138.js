The typical patient with a CIS is a young adult with a single episode of central nervous system dysfunction followed by at least partial resolution. Symptoms usually develop over the course of hours to days and then gradually remit over the ensuing weeks to months, though remission may not be complete.</p><p>In contrast, a radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) is defined by incidental brain or spinal cord MRI findings that are highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis, based upon location and morphology within the central nervous system, in an asymptomatic patient lacking any history, symptoms, or signs of multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Typically the MRI has been obtained for a completely unrelated condition such as headaches or an episode of trauma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinically isolated syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CIS most often presents with long tract <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs,</span> optic neuritis, or a brainstem, cerebellar, or spinal cord syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. While CIS is by definition isolated to a single attack in time, it is not necessarily isolated in space, as approximately one-quarter of patients present with multifocal abnormalities.</p><p>There are no clinical findings that are unique to multiple sclerosis, but some are highly characteristic of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63940\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63940 \">table 1</a>). Common presenting symptoms of multiple sclerosis are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61789 \">table 2</a>). Any of these may present as a CIS. These symptoms are summarized here and discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Typical presentations of a CIS include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensory symptoms are a common initial feature of multiple sclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61789 \">table 2</a>). The range of symptoms includes numbness, tingling, pins-and-needles, tightness, coldness, and swelling of the limbs or trunk. Radicular pain can also be present, particularly in the low thoracic and abdominal regions. An intense itching sensation, especially in the cervical dermatomes and usually unilateral, is suggestive of demyelination or multiple sclerosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optic neuritis is the most common type of involvement of the visual pathways and a frequent cause of CIS. It usually presents as acute or subacute unilateral eye pain that is accentuated by ocular movements. This is followed by a variable degree of visual loss (scotomata) affecting mainly central vision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optic-neuritis-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optic neuritis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor symptoms present as leg weakness more commonly than arm weakness due to the frequent occurrence of lesions in the descending motor tracts of the spinal cord. Physical findings include spasticity, usually more marked in the legs than in the arms. The deep tendon reflexes may be exaggerated and there may be extensor plantar responses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diplopia may result from lesions in the brainstem, including cerebellar pathways.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coordination problems include gait imbalance, difficulty in performing coordinated actions with the arms, and slurred speech. These may occur as a result of impairment of cerebellar pathways. Physical examination may reveal dysmetria, decomposition of complex movements, hypotonia, or an intention tremor. Ocular findings of nystagmus, ocular dysmetria, and failure of fixation suppression (square wave jerks) suggest cerebellar or cerebello-vestibular connection dysfunction. Speech can be scanning or explosive in character, although it is rare for this particular symptom to present in isolation, as in CIS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertigo is a reported symptom in 30 to 50 percent of patients with multiple sclerosis and can be a presenting symptom in CIS. It is commonly associated with symptoms reflecting dysfunction of adjacent cranial nerves such as hyper- or hypoacusis, facial numbness, and diplopia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiologically isolated syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A RIS suggestive of multiple sclerosis is defined as a presentation without overt clinical symptoms but with incidental brain MRI findings highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Proposed diagnostic criteria for RIS are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of incidentally identified central nervous system (CNS) white matter anomalies meeting the following MRI criteria:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ovoid, well-circumscribed, and homogeneous foci with or without cerebellar involvement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>T2 hyperintensities measuring &gt;3 mm and fulfilling at least three out of four Barkhof criteria, which are 1) nine or more lesions or one or more gadolinium-enhancing lesions, 2) three or more periventricular lesions, 3) one or more juxtacortical lesions and 4) one or more infratentorial lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The CNS white matter anomalies are not consistent with a vascular pattern</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No historical accounts of clinical symptoms consistent with neurologic dysfunction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The MRI anomalies do not account for clinically apparent impairments in social, occupational, or generalized areas of functioning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The MRI anomalies are not due to the direct physiologic effects of substances (eg, drug abuse, toxic exposure) or to another medical condition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exclusion of individuals with MRI phenotypes suggestive of leukoaraiosis or extensive white matter pathology lacking involvement of the corpus callosum</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The MRI anomalies are not better accounted for by another disease process</p><p/><p>In addition to white matter abnormalities, demyelinating cortical lesions have been identified in some patients with RIS using double inversion recovery MRI sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3269639250\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a patient with a CIS includes neuroimaging, preferably with an MRI of the brain (and the spine as clinically indicated), and may include cerebrospinal fluid analysis.</p><p>A patient with an RIS, identified by incidental findings on a brain MRI (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Radiologically isolated syndrome'</a> above), is asymptomatic by definition and has no history, symptoms, or signs of multiple sclerosis.

(See <a href=\"#H1956821673\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring without treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1904028286\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebrospinal fluid analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest cerebrospinal fluid examination for patients with a CIS who have a brain MRI that shows no or few lesions (ie, MRI findings that do not meet the McDonald criteria for dissemination in space). Qualitative assessment of cerebrospinal fluid for oligoclonal IgG bands using isoelectric focusing can help to refine the risk estimation for progression to multiple sclerosis in equivocal cases. Elevation of the cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin level relative to other protein components is a common finding in patients with multiple sclerosis and suggests intrathecal synthesis. Thus, the presence of oligoclonal bands can provide supportive evidence that the underlying disorder is inflammatory and demyelinating. (See <a href=\"#H3310036120\" class=\"local\">'With oligoclonal bands'</a> below.)</p><p>The utility of cerebrospinal fluid examination for patients with an RIS is largely unknown. Some clinicians recommend lumbar puncture in patients with an RIS who have a large number of demyelinating lesions (hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted MRI), since the combination of oligoclonal bands and more than nine lesions is associated with a higher rate of multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3692245481\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical CIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with syndromes that are atypical for multiple sclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F63940\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63940 \">table 1</a>), appropriate investigations should be performed to seek alternative diagnoses or to find other features of multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Multifocal or ring enhancing white matter lesions on MRI are particularly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. Identification of spinal cord lesions on MRI adds specificity in differentiating multiple sclerosis from other inflammatory or vascular central nervous system diseases. Evoked potentials and CSF examination for oligoclonal bands should be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87824604\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimyelin antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum antimyelin antibodies have been studied as potential markers of disease activity and predictors of progression to multiple sclerosis. Although data are conflicting, most of the available studies have found that these antibodies are not associated with an increased risk of progression from a CIS to multiple sclerosis. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Antimyelin antibodies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATING THE RISK OF PROGRESSION TO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of those patients with radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) who are likely to progress to multiple sclerosis is a major goal of current research.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2278593571\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In various studies, the long-term (ie, 10 to 20 year) likelihood of developing multiple sclerosis for patients with CIS and MRI lesions ranges from 60 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/2,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8-12</a>], with most of the data suggesting that the true rate of conversion is closer to the lower end of this range. In patients with a CIS who have a normal baseline MRI, limited data suggest that the long-term prevalence of multiple sclerosis is approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">With a radiologically isolated syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a RIS are at risk of developing CIS and multiple sclerosis, but data are quite limited. One of the largest studies evaluated an international cohort of over 450 retrospectively identified subjects (approximately 78 percent female) with RIS from 22 databases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The following observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the time of the first brain MRI suggestive of multiple sclerosis, the mean age was 37 years (range 11 to 74 years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within five years from the first brain MRI study, clinical events typical of demyelination were identified in 34 percent of subjects. A subsequent report noted that conversion to symptomatic multiple sclerosis occurred in 128 subjects (28 percent); of those who converted to multiple sclerosis, criteria for primary progressive multiple sclerosis were met in 15 subjects (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant predictors for the development of a first clinical event were younger age (hazard ratio [HR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-0.99), male sex (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.24-2.99), and MRI lesions in the cervical or thoracic spinal cord (HR 3.08, 95% CI 2.06-4.62).</p><p/><p>Larger prospective studies are needed to better define the risk of multiple sclerosis associated with RIS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">After isolated optic neuritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the Optic Neuritis Treatment trial (ONTT), the cumulative five-year incidence of clinically definite multiple sclerosis was 30 percent following a first episode of idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The presence of characteristic demyelinating lesions on brain MRI is a strong predictor of developing multiple sclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81188\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81188 \">image 1</a>). In the ONTT, the risk of multiple sclerosis after 10 years was 56 percent among those with one or more lesions on MRI versus 22 percent among those with no lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Optic neuritis is discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transverse-myelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transverse myelitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients presenting with acute complete transverse myelitis (complete or near complete clinical deficits below the lesion) have a generally cited risk of multiple sclerosis of only 5 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], although some reports suggest a higher conversion rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, partial or incomplete myelitis with mild or grossly asymmetric spinal cord dysfunction is a much more common clinical entity and bears more relevance to multiple sclerosis. Patients who have acute partial myelitis as an initial presentation and cranial MRI abnormalities showing lesions typical for multiple sclerosis have a transition rate to multiple sclerosis over three to five years of 60 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. In contrast, patients with acute partial myelitis who have a normal brain MRI develop multiple sclerosis at a rate of only 10 to 30 percent over a similar time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies suggest that patients with monosymptomatic disease and positive oligoclonal bands (OCBs) have a higher risk of evolution to multiple sclerosis than those without OCBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], although CSF results do not help further in prognosis when compared with MRI alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3310036120\"><span class=\"h2\">With oligoclonal bands</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with CIS, the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid may be an independent risk factor for progression to multiple sclerosis. Supporting evidence comes from a prospective study of 415 patients with CIS, which found that the presence of oligoclonal bands was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing clinically definite multiple sclerosis (hazard ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This increased risk was independent of the number of lesions on baseline MRI. Among 113 patients with a negative MRI (ie, no lesions), the risk of developing multiple sclerosis in those with and without oligoclonal bands was 23 and 4 percent, respectively. These findings suggest that progression to multiple sclerosis is unlikely in patients with a CIS who have few or no MRI lesions and no oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In patients with an RIS, there are few data regarding the risk of progression to multiple sclerosis with oligoclonal bands. A report of 10 patients with an RIS who had cerebrospinal fluid analysis found that six had oligoclonal bands, and all six progressed to clinically definite multiple sclerosis. In contrast, progression to multiple sclerosis occurred in only one of four without oligoclonal bands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The typical patient with a CIS is a young adult with a single episode of central nervous system dysfunction followed by at least partial resolution. Symptoms usually develop over the course of hours to days and then gradually remit over the ensuing weeks to months, though remission may not be complete. In contrast, a radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) is defined by incidental MRI findings that are highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis, based upon location and morphology within the central nervous system, in an asymptomatic patient lacking any history, symptoms, or signs of demyelination. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition and clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with a CIS should have neuroimaging with a contrast-enhanced MRI in order to determine whether there is an explanatory acute inflammatory lesion in the brain or spinal cord and whether there are additional lesions on MRI that are suggestive of multiple sclerosis. In addition, for patients with a CIS who have a brain MRI that shows no or few lesions (ie, MRI findings that do not meet the McDonald criteria for dissemination in space), we suggest cerebrospinal fluid examination, as the presence of oligoclonal bands can be helpful in determining therapy.

The risk may vary according to the type of CIS (eg, optic neuritis, acute transverse myelitis) and with the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Estimating the risk of progression to multiple sclerosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can be made for some patients at the time they present with a first clinical attack (ie, a CIS) if a single MRI obtained at any time shows dissemination in space and, as evidence for dissemination in time, at least one or more asymptomatic gadolinium-enhancing and nonenhancing lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57030\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57030 \">algorithm 1</a>).
