This measurement is used clinically to evaluate the degree of renal impairment, to follow the course of the disease, and to assess the response to therapy. An attempt must also be made to obtain a specific diagnosis. The first step in this process is a careful urinalysis, looking for proteinuria, hematuria, and cellular casts. Further evaluation may include quantification of proteinuria, kidney ultrasound, referral to a nephrologist, and a kidney biopsy. Nephrology referral is especially indicated when there is a rapid decline in kidney function, an elevated albumin-to-creatinine ratio (&gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g),</span> or urinary red blood cell casts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An overview of the general issues involved in the management of the patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including modalities to slow the rate of progression, will be presented here. The specific therapy of patients with particular renal diseases is discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY OF RENAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial injury to the kidney may result in a variety of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic hematuria to renal failure requiring dialysis. Many individuals fully recover and subsequently suffer from little or no sequelae. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in children, for example, most frequently has a long-term benign prognosis. By comparison, some patients, such as those with lupus nephritis, experience repeated and chronic insults to the kidney, thereby resulting in lasting damage. Furthermore, others in whom the initial disease is either inactive or cured may still develop progressive renal disease due to hemodynamic and other mechanisms.</p><p>In addition to variations in the activity of the individual diseases, these different manifestations are partly due to how the kidney responds to injury. The kidney is able to adapt to damage by increasing the filtration rate in the remaining normal nephrons, a process called adaptive hyperfiltration. As a result, the patient with mild renal insufficiency often has a normal or near-normal serum creatinine concentration. Additional homeostatic mechanisms (most frequently occurring within the renal tubules) permit the serum concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorous and the total body water to also remain within the normal range, particularly among those with mild to moderate renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adaptive hyperfiltration, although initially beneficial, appears to result in long-term damage to the glomeruli of the remaining nephrons, which is manifest by proteinuria and progressive renal failure. This process appears to be responsible for the development of renal failure among those in whom the original illness is either inactive or cured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Estimates of single nephron glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (SNGFR) in humans support hyperfiltration as a relevant pathophysiologic mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. An elevated SNGFR was associated with risk factors for progression including obesity, a family history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and more glomerulosclerosis and arteriosclerosis suggesting compensation in remaining nephrons to maintain total GFR. The institution of measures to help prevent this process, such as antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), may slow progressive disease and even preserve renal function. If these modalities are effective, the benefit is likely to be greatest if begun before a great deal of irreversible scarring has occurred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The gradual decline in function in patients with CKD is initially asymptomatic. However, different signs and symptoms may be observed with advanced renal failure, including volume overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, hypertension, anemia, and mineral and bone disorders (MBDs). The onset of ESRD results in a constellation of signs and symptoms referred to as uremia.</p><p>Manifestations of the uremic state include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, pericarditis, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system abnormalities (ranging from loss of concentration and lethargy to seizures, coma, and death). No direct correlation exists between the absolute serum levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine and the development of these symptoms. Some patients have relatively low levels (eg, a BUN of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [21.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> in an older patient) but are markedly symptomatic, while others have marked elevations (eg, a BUN of 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> but remain asymptomatic. To continue life, uremic patients require the institution of renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or renal transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uremic-toxins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uremic toxins&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Not all individuals have progressive loss of kidney function. Some studies show a high rate of progression, while others report relatively stable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The rate of progression of CKD from one major stage to another varies based upon the underlying disease, presence or absence of comorbid conditions, treatments, socioeconomic status, individual genetics, ethnicity, and other factors. Episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) may cause more rapid progression to ESRD in individual patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kidney and patient outcomes after acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Using epidemiologic data, general estimates for the rate of transition from an estimated GFR (eGFR) between 15 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> to end-stage disease may be approximately 1.5 percent per year, while the rate of transition from an eGFR &gt;60 to &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> is approximately 0.5 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The combination of both a low eGFR plus dipstick-positive proteinuria versus either parameter alone is associated with a significantly increased risk of progressive renal disease. This was shown in a retrospective study of the association between these measures and the 25-year incidence of ESRD of middle-aged men originally studied in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Study (MRFIT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The presence of 1+ dipstick proteinuria, 2+ dipstick proteinuria, eGFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and a low eGFR plus 2+ proteinuria was associated with hazard ratios of 3.1, 15.7, 2.4, and 41, respectively, for the development of ESRD over a 25-year period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CKD is defined as the presence of kidney damage (usually detected as urinary albumin excretion of &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or equivalent) <strong>or</strong> decreased kidney function (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) <strong>for three or more months</strong>, irrespective of the cause. The persistence of the damage or decreased function for at least three months is necessary to distinguish CKD from acute kidney disease (AKI).</p><p>Classification, or staging, of CKD provides a guide to management, including stratification of risk for progression and complications of CKD. Risk stratification is used to inform appropriate treatments and the intensity of monitoring and patient education. We agree with the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines that state that, among patients who are diagnosed using the criteria described above, staging of CKD should be done according to the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F70597\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70597 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cause of disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six categories of eGFR (G stages)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three categories of albuminuria (A stages)</p><p/><p>Staging patients with CKD according to cause, eGFR, and albuminuria enhances risk stratification for the major complications of CKD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68921 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58089\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58089 \">figure 2</a>). As seen in these figures, increasing albuminuria is associated with a higher risk of adverse events at every level of eGFR.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of the definition and classification of CKD is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-staging-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and staging of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATION WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE, AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a large body of evidence that patients with CKD have a substantial increase in cardiovascular risk that can be in part explained by an increase in traditional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. CKD alone is also an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Among patients with CKD, the risk of death, particularly due to cardiovascular disease, is much higher than the risk of eventually requiring dialysis. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Close attention to the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease should occur among patients identified with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As an example, the increased intake of calcium (which is commonly given to treat hyperphosphatemia and may result in a high calcium-phosphorus product) may enhance coronary arterial calcification. Although controversial, this is thought by some to be associated with the development of coronary atherosclerosis and is related to the presence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consequences of elevated serum phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Mineral and bone disorders (MBD)'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These and other observations have suggested that CKD should be considered a coronary equivalent and that aggressive risk factor reduction should be part of standard therapy of patients with CKD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'CKD as a CHD risk equivalent'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Reduction of CHD risk in patients with CKD'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with CKD are also at increased risk for the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as all-cause mortality. The competing risks of cardiovascular and ESRD vary depending on the population of patients studied and factors such as age, proteinuria, and type of kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease#H599734827\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic kidney disease and coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Competing risks of cardiovascular and end-stage renal disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general management of the patient with CKD involves the following issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of reversible causes of renal failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventing or slowing the progression of renal disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of the complications of renal failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjusting drug doses when appropriate for the level of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification and adequate preparation of the patient in whom renal replacement therapy will be required</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Reversible causes of renal failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to exacerbation of their original renal disease, patients with CKD with a recent decrease in renal function may be suffering from an underlying reversible process, which, if identified and corrected, may result in the recovery of function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Decreased renal perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypovolemia (such as vomiting, diarrhea, diuretic use, bleeding), hypotension (due to myocardial dysfunction or pericardial disease), infection (such as sepsis), and the administration of drugs which lower the eGFR (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] and angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) are common causes of potentially reversible declines in renal function.</p><p>In patient with CKD, hypovolemia should be diagnosed by history and physical examination rather than the urine sodium or fractional excretion of sodium. The normal response to renal hypoperfusion is to lower the urine sodium concentration (&lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> and the fractional excretion of sodium (&lt;1 percent in patients with advanced renal failure) to very low levels. However, the superimposition of a prerenal process among patients with CKD may not result in the expected low values, since the tubules in the diseased kidney are unable to reabsorb sodium so efficiently. If hypovolemia is suspected, a judicious trial of fluid repletion may result in the return of renal function to the previous baseline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fractional excretion of sodium, urea, and other molecules in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12237332\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration of nephrotoxic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of drugs or diagnostic agents that adversely affect renal function is a frequent cause of worsening renal function. Among patients with CKD, common offenders include aminoglycoside antibiotics (particularly with unadjusted doses), NSAIDs, and radiographic contrast material. The administration of such drugs should therefore be avoided or used with caution in patients with underlying CKD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Manifestations of and risk factors for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Certain drugs also interfere with either creatinine secretion or the assay used to measure the serum creatinine.

In these settings, there will be no change in the true GFR; the clinical clue that this may have occurred is the absence of a concurrent elevation in the blood urea nitrogen (BUN). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-that-elevate-the-serum-creatinine-concentration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs that elevate the serum creatinine concentration&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary tract obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary tract obstruction should always be considered in the patient with unexplained worsening renal function, although, in the absence of prostatic disease, it is much less common than decreased renal perfusion. Patients with slowly developing obstruction typically have no changes in the urinalysis, no symptoms referable to the kidney, and initially maintain their urine output. Given this lack of clinical clues, renal ultrasonography is often performed to exclude urinary tract obstruction in patients with an unexplained elevation in the serum creatinine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Slowing the rate of progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in experimental animals and humans suggest that progression in CKD may be due at least in part to secondary factors that are unrelated to the activity of the initial disease. The major factors are thought to be intraglomerular hypertension and glomerular hypertrophy (which are primarily responsible for the adaptive hyperfiltration described above), leading to glomerular scarring (glomerulosclerosis). Additional causes may include systemic hypertension, hyperlipidemia, metabolic acidosis, and tubulointerstitial disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major histologic manifestation of hemodynamically mediated renal injury is secondary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, proteinuria typically is present in patients with progressive CKD, even in primary tubulointerstitial diseases such as reflux nephropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18078125\"><span class=\"h3\">Principal targets for renal protection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapy to slow the rate of progression in patients with CKD, independent of treatment of the underlying disease, is centered on attaining the blood pressure goal and, in patients with proteinuric disease, attaining the proteinuria goal.

Proteinuria goals and the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) agents in patients with proteinuric CKD are discussed elsewhere.

One relatively characteristic feature of uremic pericarditis is that the electrocardiogram does not usually show the typical diffuse ST and T wave elevation, presumably because this is a metabolic pericarditis, and epicardial injury is uncommon. Thus, the finding of these abnormalities suggests some other cause for the pericarditis. The occurrence of pericarditis in a patient with mild to moderate CKD is another clue that the renal disease is probably not responsible.</p><p>The development of otherwise unexplained pericarditis in a patient with advanced renal failure is an indication to institute dialysis (providing there is no circulatory compromise or evidence of impending tamponade) (see below). Most patients with uremic pericarditis respond rapidly to dialysis, with resolution of chest pain as well as a decrease in the size of the pericardial effusion.

This was illustrated in a review of 460 patients starting dialysis over a four-year period, of whom 46, 37, and 17 percent presented less than one month, one to three months, and more than three months prior to initiating dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

These adverse associations are probably due in part to a greater prevalence of uremic complications and other serious illnesses, such as uncontrolled hypertension and pulmonary edema. In addition, vascular access placement and the management of complications related to this aspect of dialysis care are a frequent cause of hospitalization and a large component of the cost of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/63,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,87,88</a>].</p><p>Despite the pressure to control health care costs by avoiding hospitalization, a large proportion of patients with ESRD in the United States are hospitalized for initiation of dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/68,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,89</a>]. This may in part be due to late referral, but perceptions of nephrologists that dialysis should be initiated in the hospital setting, as well as regional regulations requiring a first dialysis to be at an inpatient facility, may also have contributed.

Compared with the group cared for by generalists, patients treated by nephrologists were significantly less likely to have required a temporary venous catheter for the first dialysis (36 versus 89 percent).

Observational and nonrandomized prospective studies have suggested that, compared with standard nephrology care, patients who attend a multidisciplinary CKD clinic have fewer hospitalizations, are more likely to have an arterial-venous fistula rather than graft or catheter, are more likely to start dialysis as an outpatient, are more likely to adhere to established CKD anemia or mineral and bone disease (MBD) goals, and may have improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/85,101-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,101-104</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H791401168\"><span class=\"h2\">Care management programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits<strong> </strong>of an outpatient care management program were demonstrated in a randomized, controlled trial that included 130 patients with GFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. Patients were assigned to either standard care or to a &quot;Healthy Transitions Program,&quot; which utilized nurse care managers supported by a protocol-driven informatics system that provided daily reports that identified incomplete process steps for each patient.

The most frequent cause of hospitalization was volume overload. Peritoneal dialysis was the initial RRT in more patients in the Healthy Transitions group compared with control (23 versus 3 percent, respectively). Hemodialysis was started without hospitalization in more patients in the Healthy Transitions group compared with control (58 versus 23 percent).

Early identification enables dialysis to be initiated at the optimal time with a functioning chronic access and may also permit the recruitment and evaluation of family members for the placement of a renal allograft prior to the need for dialysis. In addition, the ability of the individual to psychologically accept the requirement of lifelong renal replacement therapy is often diminished if inadequate time has elapsed between the time of recognition of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and the initiation of dialysis.</p><p>CKD progresses at a variable rate due to differences in the clinical course of the underlying diseases (particularly between individuals) and the recognition that the natural history of progressive renal disease can be altered by various therapeutic interventions, particularly strict blood pressure control with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Slowing the rate of progression'</a> above). As a result, exactly if and when a patient may require dialysis or renal transplantation is unclear. In addition, some patients refuse renal replacement therapy until the onset of absolute indications, while others desire early initiation to avoid the complications of severe CKD, such as malnutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of renal replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once it is determined that renal replacement therapy will eventually be medically indicated, the patient should be counseled to consider the advantages and disadvantages of hemodialysis (in-center or at home), peritoneal dialysis (continuous or intermittent modalities), and renal transplantation (living or deceased donor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>]. The option of conservative management should also be discussed among patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo renal replacement therapy. The 2015 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend that patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> should be educated concerning these issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].</p><p>Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for ESRD. A successful kidney transplant improves the quality of life and reduces the mortality risk for most patients when compared with maintenance dialysis. To facilitate early transplantation, a 2008 National Kidney Foundation (NKF)-KDOQI conference suggested early education and referral to a transplantation center plus the identification of potential living donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].</p><p>However, not all patients are appropriate candidates for a kidney allograft, because of absolute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> relative contraindications to this procedure or the subsequent required medications.

However, the patient, particularly older adults and terminally ill, may decline renal replacement therapy, a choice which is assuming more prominence as patients and clinicians grapple with the increasing use of advance directives and the laudable goals of death with dignity and life with quality. We agree with the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines that conservative management of ESRD should be an option for such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

The 2012 KDIGO guidelines suggest that dialysis be initiated when there are signs or symptoms attributable to kidney failure (such as serositis, acid-base or electrolyte disorders not easily corrected medically, pruritus); an inability to control volume status or blood pressure; a progressive deterioration in nutritional status that is refractory to dietary interventions; or cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The 2012 KDIGO guidelines state that such signs and symptoms often but not invariably occur when the eGFR is between 5 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>All approaches require close follow-up, early nephrology referral, and adequate advanced dialysis planning (including the presence of a functioning peritoneal or vascular access and referral for transplantation). A detailed discussion of the indications for dialysis in the patient with CKD can be found elsewhere.

The persistence of the damage or decreased function for at least three months is necessary to distinguish CKD from acute kidney disease. Classification, or staging, of CKD provides a guide to management. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Definition and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CKD is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), infection, malignancy, and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Association with cardiovascular disease, end-stage renal disease, and mortality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H134901364\" class=\"local\">'Infection and vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of CKD includes treatment of reversible causes of renal dysfunction and preventing or slowing the progression of renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Reversible causes of renal failure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Slowing the rate of progression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of the loss of renal function include disorders of fluid and electrolyte balance, such as volume overload, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and hyperphosphatemia, as well as abnormalities related to hormonal or systemic dysfunction, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hypertension, anemia, malnutrition, hyperlipidemia, and bone disease. Attention needs to be paid to all of these issues. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of the complications of renal failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CKD should be referred to a nephrologist when eGFR is &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> in order to discuss and potentially plan for renal replacement therapy. Co-management of the patient with the primary care provider is a common strategy at early stages of CKD, The optimal medical care of later-stage CKD patients may be best provided by a team of healthcare professionals who practice at a single site (ie, a CKD clinic), following the principles of the chronic disease model of care. (See <a href=\"#H114783633\" class=\"local\">'Referral to nephrologists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to identify patients who may eventually require renal replacement therapy since adequate preparation can decrease morbidity and perhaps mortality. Such patients should be counseled to consider the advantages and disadvantages of hemodialysis (in-center or at home), peritoneal dialysis (continuous or intermittent modalities), and renal transplantation (living or deceased donor). The option of conservative management should also be discussed among patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo renal replacement therapy. Early referral to a surgeon for evaluation and establishment of arteriovenous (AV) access is needed for patients choosing hemodialysis.
