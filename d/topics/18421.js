Peritoneal dialysis is an overlooked procedure for dialytic support in AKI as it is primarily used for the treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Nevertheless, acute peritoneal dialysis remains a viable option for the treatment of selected patients with AKI, particularly those who are hemodynamically compromised or have severe coagulation abnormalities, or when other modalities are not readily available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>].</p><p>The advantages, indications, and contraindications of acute peritoneal dialysis and the components of an acute peritoneal dialysis prescription will be reviewed here. The indications for dialysis in AKI and the use of hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapies are discussed separately.

This is particularly so if an urgent-start peritoneal dialysis program is already in place (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urgent-start-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>). The procedure is relatively simple, can be performed by trained intensive care unit (ICU) nursing staff, and is less labor intensive compared with other continuous renal replacement therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and maintenance of the peritoneal dialysis catheter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The continuous nature of acute peritoneal dialysis involves the slow removal of solutes (eg, urea) and fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is therefore desirable in hemodynamically unstable patients because large amounts of fluid can be removed over a prolonged period of time (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a>). An ultrafiltration goal of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">liters/day</span> is readily achievable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Slow correction of metabolic imbalances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute peritoneal dialysis enables continuous correction of acid-base status and electrolyte imbalance and the gradual removal of nitrogenous waste products. The slow removal of uremic toxins with acute peritoneal dialysis is not associated with the development of the disequilibrium syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome&quot;</a>). Within three to four days, blood levels of creatinine, urea, potassium, and bicarbonate are stabilized or normalized with aggressive daily peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Easy access placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute peritoneal dialysis access can be achieved without serious difficulty by inserting a semirigid catheter or by placing a single-cuff Tenckhoff catheter. The semirigid catheter insertion can be performed at the bedside by a nephrologist or surgeon. The Tenckhoff catheter is usually placed in the operating room by a surgeon; this flexible catheter is more comfortable for the patient who is moving around in bed, and operative insertion avoids the occasional development of intestinal perforation with percutaneous insertion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and maintenance of the peritoneal dialysis catheter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many nephrologists insert their own catheters using either a fluoroscopy table with guidewire-directed insertion or a peritoneoscope insertion technique. Both techniques are suitable for bedside catheter insertion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic anticoagulation not required</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the peritoneal dialysis procedure does not require systemic anticoagulation, excellent candidates for this modality include the following patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with a bleeding diathesis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in the immediate postoperative period</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage</p><p/><p>This is not an absolute advantage compared with hemodialysis, since techniques are available to perform that latter procedure without systemic anticoagulant.

On the other hand, glucose loading can be problematic in some patients with the use of hypertonic (2.5 and 4.25 percent dextrose) dialysates, so surveillance is important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Tolerated in children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute peritoneal dialysis has been frequently utilized and is the preferred form of therapy for dialysis among children with AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The technique is convenient, relatively simple, and safe to perform in children, particularly since peritoneal access is easily obtained.

This has probably been the major explanation for the less frequent use of peritoneal dialysis in the setting of AKI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Recent abdominal and/or cardiothoracic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The performance of acute peritoneal dialysis may be difficult after abdominal surgery because of the violation of the peritoneal cavity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the placement of multiple abdominal drains. Abdominal drains increase the incidence of infection and confound fluid accounting with ongoing peritoneal dialysis. The presence of abdominal hernia or intra-abdominal adhesions in these patients may also make peritoneal dialysis difficult.</p><p>In addition, a diaphragmatic pleuroperitoneal communication may be present in patients after cardiothoracic (CT) surgery, thereby resulting in a large pleural effusion if peritoneal dialysis is initiated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pleural-effusions-following-cardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pleural effusions following cardiac surgery&quot;</a>). However, CT surgery patients in whom the peritoneal cavity is intact and the integrity of the diaphragm is maintained, as well as those who have adequate vital capacity, are acceptable candidates for acute peritoneal dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instilling fluid in the peritoneal cavity will increase intra-abdominal pressure. Among patients with respiratory failure, this increase in pressure may compromise lung function (by limiting diaphragmatic excursion), thereby interfering with respiratory exchange. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal compartment syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe gastroesophageal reflux disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased intra-abdominal pressure may worsen symptoms in patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. If peritoneal dialysis is required, such symptoms may be diminished with the placement of patients in body positions that minimize reflux (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;</a>). In fact, though, mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated improved oxygenation while on peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe hyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since peritoneal dialysis does not remove potassium quickly, this modality is less desirable than other renal replacement therapies for the treatment of life-threatening hyperkalemia not responding to medical measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>). However, peritoneal dialysis is still useful in the management of less severe hyperkalemia. In addition to the gradual removal of potassium, peritoneal dialysis may also enhance the intracellular movement of potassium by generating bicarbonate and stimulating insulin production (via the administration of intraperitoneal glucose).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe volume overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since fluid removal is relatively limited with peritoneal dialysis, patients with life-threatening fluid overload may not be the best candidates for the modality. The rate of ultrafiltration in peritoneal dialysis is dependent upon multiple factors, including the hypertonicity of the glucose solution; as a result, titration of fluid removal is not as easily achieved as it is with hemodialysis.</p><p>Nevertheless, rapid volume removal is possible using high-glucose concentrations and rapid exchanges. A 2 liter exchange of 4.25 percent dextrose can achieve 1 liter of ultrafiltration at four hours, and, if hyperglycemia does not ensue, this regimen can be repeated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An additional concern with this approach is the complication of hypernatremia (see <a href=\"#H62\" class=\"local\">'Hypernatremia'</a> below). Patients with severe volume overload who are not supported by a ventilator are potentially vulnerable to compromised diaphragmatic excursion with aggressive ultrafiltration techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypercatabolic patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since acute peritoneal dialysis is limited with respect to the rate of solute removal, severely hypercatabolic patients should be offered an alternate renal replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Mildly to moderately hypercatabolic patients can clearly benefit from peritoneal dialysis as demonstrated in a prospective, randomized, crossover study from India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute kidney injury in pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women with AKI are potentially good candidates for acute peritoneal dialysis therapy because of the hemodynamic stability associated with the technique. However, there is a paucity of literature related to this issue. For obvious reasons, acute semirigid peritoneal dialysis catheters should be avoided in this setting, and permanent peritoneal dialysis catheters should be placed under direct visualization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute peritoneal dialysis can be performed intermittently or continuously (depending upon the desired amount of fluid and solute removal) and either manually or via an automated device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3,5,8,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,8,13,14</a>].</p><p>Acute manual peritoneal dialysis is usually performed by nurses since it requires constant supervision to ensure proper inflow and accurate dwell and drain times. Nursing assistance is also required for the maintenance of a record of exchange and drain volumes and the documentation of net ultrafiltration.</p><p>By comparison, the use of the automated device or cycler reduces the need for constant nursing supervision. The number of interruptions is significantly decreased since large volumes of solutions can be prepared at the beginning of the procedure. In addition, the next generation of cyclers will have capacity for remote monitoring and adjustments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute intermittent peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This technique can either be performed manually or can be delivered by an automated cycling device. The prescription usually involves short dwell times with 1 to 3 liter inflow volumes and dialysate flow rates of 2 to 6 liters per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/2,3,5,8,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,8,14,15</a>]. The session may last 12 to 24 hours and occur every other day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic equilibrated peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic equilibrated peritoneal dialysis (CEPD) is similar to chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, except that CEPD is performed in patients who are not ambulatory. This technique maintains a fairly stable fluid and solute balance and can be performed manually approximately four times daily with dwell times of four to six hours. CEPD can also be performed using an automated machine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3-5,8,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,8,15-18</a>] that provides reliable and timed exchanges, thereby eliminating the need for interruptions or breaks in the sterile technique. CEPD dosing can be adjusted based upon the amount of fluid or nitrogenous wastes that require removal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Tidal peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD) is a form of peritoneal dialysis prescription that leaves a constant &quot;tidal&quot; volume of 10 to 50 percent of the inflow volume in the peritoneal cavity after the peritoneum is filled with a normal or large (3 liter) dialysate volume. This allows for rapid exchange, using a cycler, of approximately half the peritoneal fluid instilled, thereby improving overall solute clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/2,6,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,19,20</a>]. In a prospective, randomized, crossover trial in India, the normalized urea clearance and normalized creatinine clearance were 16 and 35 percent greater with TPD compared with CEPD. In addition, these outcomes were achieved in less time and at less cost with TPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Continuous flow peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous flow peritoneal dialysis (CFPD) is an old technique that has regained popularity in the management of patients with AKI. CFPD utilizes two accesses, one for ingress and the other for egress of dialysate. A large intraperitoneal volume of dialysate is replenished in a continuous manner (single-pass CFPD) or by using an external dialyzer to regenerate the sterile dialysate. This technique allows for increased dialysate flow rates of up to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and urea clearances in the range of 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. Several catheter designs are now available for CFPD to facilitate adequate mixing of intraperitoneal dialysate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4282885042\"><span class=\"h2\">High-volume peritoneal dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An automated cycler is used to perform frequent exchanges. Originally described using 18 to 22 2 liter exchanges per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>], there are reports of even more frequent exchanges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This technique provides the greatest small-solute clearance of any peritoneal dialysis technique and probably the greatest ultrafiltration rate but is very fluid and cost intensive. Furthermore, with rapid exchanges, peritoneal surface contact time with dialysate is reduced, and the clearance of middle- and larger-molecular-weight solutes is lower than is achieved with slower exchange rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/5,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the important determinants of a successful acute peritoneal dialysis procedure is a reliable peritoneal access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. Peritoneal access can easily be obtained by inserting a semirigid acute catheter or a single-cuff Tenckhoff catheter. Each has advantages and disadvantages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Semirigid acute catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main advantage of a semirigid acute peritoneal dialysis catheter is that it can be placed relatively easily at the bedside by a nephrologist, without the help of a surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Since it is usually performed under local anesthesia, the potential risks of general anesthesia are avoided in the critically ill and unstable patient.</p><p>However, there are several disadvantages to the use of semirigid catheters. The most important is the enhanced risk of infection because acute catheters do not have cuffs that protect against bacterial migration. The incidence of peritonitis is high, particularly if the catheter is left in place for more than 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. There is also a risk of bowel perforation both at the time of insertion and with increased length of time of placement. Thus, these catheters must be removed within 72 hours.

The total length of a continuous acute peritoneal dialysis session averages approximately 48 to 72 hours since a session usually consists of 48 to 72 exchanges, each of which lasts approximately one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] (see <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Dwell time'</a> below). Nevertheless, the length of the peritoneal dialysis session can vary significantly since it is dependent upon the cause and duration of AKI, the amount of solute and fluid removal that is desired, and the risk of infection, particularly with rigid catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/4,5,14,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,14,24</a>].</p><p>To accommodate the unpredictable course of AKI and the overall condition of these critically unstable patients, acute peritoneal dialysis orders should only be written for a period of 24 hours. Periodic adjustments may need to be made based upon the patient evaluation and laboratory parameters, which should be performed at least daily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialysate composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peritoneal dialysis solution is available in standard hydrous dextrose concentrations of 1.5, 2.5, and 4.25 percent. Most other solutions (eg, amino acids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icodextrin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icodextrin</a>) probably have little utility in the AKI setting. Dialysate solutions should be warmed to body temperature prior to infusion to avoid discomfort and enhance solute transport.</p><p>To obtain better ultrafiltration, it is reasonable to initiate acute peritoneal dialysis in most patients with the 2.5 percent dialysate solution. An initial dialysis solution dextrose concentration of 1.5 percent may be more appropriate in patients with only moderate amounts of fluid overload and in those who are hemodynamically unstable. Even with 1.5 percent dextrose solutions, frequent exchanges, such as hourly, can lead to ultrafiltration rates of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>.</p><p>Dialysis solutions with higher dextrose concentration can be substituted based upon the ultrafiltration requirements and the patient's hemodynamic parameters. With a standard regimen, such as a 2 liter exchange volume and one-hour dwell time, the following average amounts of fluid can be removed over a 24-hour period:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2.5 liters with 1.5 percent dextrose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4.5 liters with 2.5 percent dextrose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>8.5 liters with 4.25 percent dextrose</p><p/><p>The most practical way to achieve adequate fluid removal is by mixing and matching low- and high-dextrose concentration solutions. Once the patient is euvolemic, the dialysis solution should be switched to a dextrose concentration of 1.5 percent and the rate of exchange slowed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Exchange volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exchange volume is the amount of dialysis solution instilled into the peritoneal cavity during an exchange. Factors affecting this volume include the peritoneal cavity size, the presence of pulmonary disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hernia(s), fresh abdominal incisions, the degree of uremic toxicity, and the desire to limit leakage of dialysate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal cavity size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The area of the peritoneal cavity, which can be estimated by the size of the patient, is the most important determinant of exchange volume. An average 60 to 80 kg adult can tolerate 2 liter exchanges without much difficulty. Smaller patients may require smaller exchange volumes, while exchange volumes of 2.5 to 3 liters may be utilized to improve dialysis efficiency in larger patients with no obvious contraindications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with pulmonary diseases, such as pneumonia, chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">obstructive/restrictive</span> lung disease, and respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support, may require smaller exchange volumes to prevent compromise of diaphragmatic excursions and respiration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Hernias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with abdominal wall or inguinal hernias, the exchange volume must be reduced to limit the increase in intra-abdominal pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Leakage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinicians keep the exchange volume low for the first day to avoid leaks from the new catheter insertion site. The dialysate volume can then be gradually increased over the ensuing three to four days as tolerated by the patient. This approach emphasizes starting peritoneal dialysis early enough such that aggressive inflow volumes are not needed initially.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflow time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflow time is the time required to instill the dialysate into the peritoneal cavity, a process usually driven by gravity. Inflow usually takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>]. Factors that determine the inflow time include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dialysate volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degree of elevation of the dialysate bag above the patient's abdomen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of absence inflow resistance resulting from kinking of the peritoneal catheter or from reduced bowel motility. Bowel evacuation is helpful.</p><p/><p>To maximize the efficiency of dialysis, it is imperative to keep the inflow time to a minimum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Dwell time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dwell time is the period in which the full exchange volume remains in the peritoneal cavity or the time between the end of inflow to the beginning of the drain period. In tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD), some volume is intentionally left in the peritoneal cavity (ie, the peritoneal cavity is intentionally not completely emptied during drainage).</p><p>The dwell time for standard acute peritoneal dialysis is approximately 30 to 90 minutes, the time at which the gradients favoring urea and fluid removal are most favorable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A dwell time &lt;30 minutes is usually not adequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/24,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,29</a>].</p><p>The usual dwell time for patients on acute chronic equilibrated peritoneal dialysis (CEPD) is approximately three to six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In these patients, dwell times can be shortened to increase the total number of exchanges, thereby enhancing solute clearance. In patients with peritonitis, it is necessary to shorten the dwell time because the glucose gradient dissipates more quickly across the more permeable peritoneum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">Outflow time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outflow time is the time required to drain the effluent dialysate from the peritoneal cavity. The outflow of the dialysate is controlled by gravity and usually takes approximately 20 to 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>]. Some of the major determinants of the outflow time include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume of the dialysate effluent to be drained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outflow resistance, which results from kinks in the catheter, decreased bowel motility, and fibrin in the dialysate. Bowel evacuation often shortens drainage time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The height difference between the patient and the drainage bag.</p><p/><p>As with the inflow time, it is important to keep the outflow time to a minimum. This can be done by adjusting the height of the drainage bag.</p><p>It is extremely important to ensure complete drainage since incomplete drainage can result in progressive accumulation of dialysate in the peritoneal cavity, leading to respiratory embarrassment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal discomfort. This differs from the intentional fluid left in the peritoneal cavity during TPD. The peritoneal dialysis orders should specify to &quot;continue outflow until drainage stops&quot; to avoid incomplete drainage. However, complete drainage at each exchange is not mandatory, and an alternative is to assure that it occurs after every second or third exchange. This obviates the wasting of crucial dialysis with slow or inefficient drainage. Outflow is the rate-limiting step. If slow (requiring 20 to 30 minutes to complete) drainage occurs, dwell time should be increased, and the number of exchanges per day should be decreased. This is to avoid the lost contact time during slow drainages, which decreases solute removal. Slow drainage should prompt bowel evacuation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Number of exchanges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The number of exchanges is usually determined by the amount of fluid and solute removal required in a particular patient. Although it may vary, the usual number of exchanges is approximately four to six per day with CEPD, 24 per day with standard acute peritoneal dialysis, and can be even twice that with high-volume peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H694267528\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommend peritoneal dialysis dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urea kinetic modeling, which is used to define dialysis adequacy in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), has not been validated for AKI. Nonetheless, extrapolations from the chronic kidney failure setting have influenced recommendations in the acute setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and have been advanced by the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A reasonable minimal target for small-solute clearance (eg, urea) is a standardized weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 2.1 or 0.3 daily if performed seven <span class=\"nowrap\">days/week</span>. In a pilot study to assess the role of an increased peritoneal dialysis dose in patients with AKI, there was no definite outcome advantage to the higher dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialysis solution additives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drugs can be added to the dialysis solution to treat specific conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is imperative to follow sterile technique when adding additives into dialysate solutions. Some of the commonly used dialysate additives are heparin, insulin, and potassium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h3\">Heparin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heparin is occasionally added to dialysate solutions at a dose of 200 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> to prevent fibrin clot formation, which can obstruct the peritoneal catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although it is usually added when plugs or strands of fibrin are visible in the drained fluid, heparin is more beneficial when added prophylactically. Once outflow obstruction is established, there is usually a poor response to heparin. Instillation of fibrinolytic agents would be necessary. Since neither heparin nor fibrinolytic agents is absorbed through the peritoneum, neither produces systemic anticoagulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h3\">Insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin is occasionally administered intraperitoneally in diabetic patients on peritoneal dialysis. The use of hypertonic dextrose-containing dialysate solutions in diabetics results in a significant glucose load; this burden can result in uncontrolled blood glucose levels if not managed with appropriate insulin dosing. Intraperitoneal insulin added to the dialysate solutions is adjusted based upon frequent blood glucose monitoring (approximately every six hours). One simple algorithm consists of an increasing insulin dose to be administered in the dialysis bag with increasing dextrose concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> for 1.5 percent dextrose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> for 2.5 percent dextrose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> for 4.5 percent dextrose</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42\"><span class=\"h3\">Potassium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The addition of potassium to dialysate in acute peritoneal dialysis should never be used to correct serious hypokalemia, since other routes are preferred to correct hypokalemia. Instead, the addition of potassium to dialysate in peritoneal dialysis in the AKI setting can be used to maintain serum potassium in the normal range, especially when the avoidance of hypokalemia is imperative. Since standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peritoneal dialysis solutions</a> do not contain any potassium, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> can be added to the dialysate (usually 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> to prevent hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/5,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring fluid balance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is essential to maintain accurate flow records that monitor intake and output and document net ultrafiltration.

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study was performed in Vietnam in which 70 patients with AKI due to either malaria or sepsis (48 and 22 individuals, respectively) were randomly assigned to either peritoneal dialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A markedly increased risk of death was observed among the group administered peritoneal dialysis (47 versus 15 percent, odds ratio [OR] 5.1, 95% CI 1.6-16). In addition, the mortality rate for patients on CVVH was unusually low. Possible reasons for the poorer survival in the peritoneal dialysis group include lower overall creatinine clearance, use of acetate (not bicarbonate) in the peritoneal dialysis dialysate, use of rigid peritoneal dialysis catheters, and other peritoneal dialysis-specific factors that are not yet defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition, the peritoneal dialysate was made in the study hospital pharmacy, while commercial peritoneal dialysate used in most countries contains lactate instead of acetate. It is likely that, when continuous flow peritoneal dialysis (CFPD) gains popularity, outcome studies with this modality will be performed with an expected benefit superior to that of current acute peritoneal dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review identified seven cohort studies and four randomized trials (including the study cited above) that compared peritoneal dialysis with continuous or intermittent hemodialysis in the setting of AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-peritoneal-dialysis-for-the-treatment-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There was no difference in mortality between peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis in either the cohort studies or randomized trials. However, there was significant heterogeneity in the randomized trials (which spanned over four decades), possibly resulting from changes in the technology of peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, as well as in the epidemiology of AKI.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371259006\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Although peritoneal dialysis is an overlooked procedure for dialytic support in AKI, acute peritoneal dialysis remains a viable option for the treatment of selected patients with AKI. This is particularly true for those who are hemodynamically compromised or have severe coagulation abnormalities or when other modalities are not readily available. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with other available modalities, peritoneal dialysis has several advantages as a renal replacement therapy in patients with AKI. These include wide availability, ease of performance and access placement, ability to remove large amounts of fluid in hemodynamically unstable patients, easy and gradual correction of acid-base and electrolyte imbalance, no need for anticoagulation, and high biocompatibility. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Advantages'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a number of indications and contraindications for acute peritoneal dialysis in AKI. Most are only relative indications or relative contraindications for the technique. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute peritoneal dialysis can be performed intermittently or continuously (depending upon the desired amount of fluid and solute removal) and either manually or via an automated device.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute manual peritoneal dialysis is usually performed by nurses. By comparison, the use of the automated device or cycler reduces the need for constant nursing supervision. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The standard acute peritoneal dialysis prescription includes the length of the dialysis session, dialysate composition, exchange volume, inflow and outflow (drain) periods, dwell time, number of exchanges, dialysate additives, and monitoring fluid balance. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Components of acute peritoneal dialysis prescription'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute peritoneal dialysis is associated with complications, some of which are serious and potentially life threatening. Many are preventable.
