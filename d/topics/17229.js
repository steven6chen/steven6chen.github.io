The thyroid is a gland in the middle of the neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66834 \">figure 1</a>). The thyroid gland makes thyroid hormone.</p><p>There are different types of thyroid cancer. Some types are more serious than others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13414432\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of thyroid cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early on, people might not notice any symptoms. They might find out they have thyroid cancer after their doctor does an imaging test of their neck for another reason. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>When thyroid cancer causes symptoms, the most common symptom is a growth (called a &quot;nodule&quot;) on the thyroid gland. This growth usually gets bigger in a short amount of time. In some cases, people see or feel the growth themselves. In other cases, their doctor or nurse feels the growth during a routine exam.</p><p>Other symptoms of thyroid cancer can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hoarseness or being unable to talk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cough or coughing up blood</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not thyroid cancer. But if you have these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13414447\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for thyroid cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have a growth on your thyroid gland, your doctor will do tests to see whether the growth is cancer or not. (Many growths on the thyroid gland are not cancer.) These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests &ndash; The imaging test most often done is an ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create pictures of the thyroid. Some people also have a thyroid scan. For a thyroid scan, a person gets a pill or a shot with a small amount of a radioactive substance. Then a special camera takes a picture of the thyroid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fine needle aspiration &ndash; For this test, the doctor uses a thin needle to remove a small sample of tissue from the growth. Then another doctor looks at the tissue under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13414462\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if a cancer has spread past the layer of tissue where it began, and, if so, how far.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the type of thyroid cancer you have, its stage, and your other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13414477\"><span class=\"h1\">How is thyroid cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid cancer is usually treated with 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; In most cases, thyroid cancer is treated with surgery to remove the cancer. Your doctor will remove part or all of your thyroid gland. He or she might also remove nearby lymph nodes, which are bean-shaped organs that are part of the body's infection-fighting system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radioactive iodine &ndash; Radioactive iodine (also called &quot;radioiodine therapy&quot;) comes in a pill or liquid that you swallow. It has a small amount of radiation and can destroy much of the thyroid gland.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid hormone &ndash; Your doctor will prescribe thyroid hormone medicines after surgery or radioactive iodine treatment. That way, your body will have the correct amount of thyroid hormone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External-beam radiation therapy &ndash; This treatment uses high doses of X-rays, called radiation, to kill cancer cells. The radiation comes from a machine that is outside the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13414492\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check you every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Regular follow-up tests include exams, blood tests, and imaging tests. Your doctor will also do regular follow-up blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels.</p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean your thyroid cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13414507\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my thyroid cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your thyroid cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more surgery, radioactive iodine treatment, external-beam radiation, or chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13414522\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for thyroid cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13414537\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-nodules-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Thyroid nodules (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-nodules-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Thyroid nodules (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
