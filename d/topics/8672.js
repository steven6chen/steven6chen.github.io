Hip pain has different etiologies in adults and children. In adults, hip pain may be caused by intraarticular disorders such as avascular necrosis (AVN), arthritis, loose bodies, labral tears; periarticular pathology such as tendinitis and bursitis; or extraarticular conditions such as referred pain from lumbar spine, as well as sacroiliac joint and nerve entrapment syndromes.</p><p>Imaging modalities used to evaluate adults with hip pain and the appropriateness of particular exams in different clinical scenarios will be reviewed here. The history and physical examination, which are necessary to develop a differential diagnosis prior to the selection of imaging tests; a general review of imaging tests that are used in the evaluation of bone and joint pain; and imaging modalities used to evaluate the hip in children are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with hip pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-techniques-for-evaluation-of-the-painful-joint\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging techniques for evaluation of the painful joint&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic evaluation of the hip in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF IMAGING EXAMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modalities available for evaluation of the hip include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain film radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain film radiography of the hip is used in the initial evaluation of any cause of hip pain, including trauma and sports injuries, suspected avascular necrosis (AVN), arthritis, hip arthroplasty, infection, dysplasia, and tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Plain film can also identify causes of referred hip pain, such as sacroiliitis. Plain film may not detect or accurately characterize some hip fractures and bone marrow edema associated with early AVN or early osteomyelitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Computerized tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computerized tomography (CT) of the hip without contrast is most useful in the setting of trauma, for preoperative planning, and for evaluation and guiding percutaneous biopsy of tumors. Intravenous contrast is administered for evaluating a septic joint or a soft tissue abscess.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In traumatic injuries, CT is used to detect intraarticular extension of a fracture, acetabular fracture, pelvic ring and sacral fractures, and intraarticular loose bodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT is also used for preoperative evaluation of hip fractures, pre- and postoperative evaluation of hip dysplasia, and hip arthroplasty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of bone tumor, CT is useful for evaluation of tumor matrix and for detection of cortical thinning or cortical destruction. CT is valuable in guidance for biopsy or ablation of certain tumors such as osteoid osteoma.</p><p/><p>CT may not detect trabecular bone injuries, which may be present in femoral neck insufficiency fractures in osteoporotic patients, and will not demonstrate the bone marrow edema of early AVN and early osteomyelitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip accurately evaluates the bone marrow, joint space, neurovascular structures, and soft tissues. Intravenous contrast is usually not administered except for evaluation of soft tissue and bone tumors or vascular malformations. MRI is the modality of choice for suspected femoral fracture not demonstrated radiographically, osteochondral injuries, muscle injuries, joint effusion, early diagnosis and staging of AVN, iliopsoas and greater trochanteric pain syndrome (formerly trochanteric bursitis), evaluation of infection, and tumor. More unusual disease entities such as pigmented villonodular synovitis and synovial osteochondromatosis can be diagnosed with MRI. Administration of gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents should be avoided in patients with severely impaired renal function (eg, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>.</p><p>If gadolinium-based imaging must be performed in a patient with moderately to severely impaired renal function, there may be a role for dialysis to reduce the risk of development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NFS). Approaches to prevention of NFS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;, section on 'If gadolinium must be given'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Radionuclide Tc-99m bone scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radionuclide Tc-99m (technetium methylene diphosphonate) bone scan can be performed as a whole-body exam or as a focused exam of the hip. It is reserved for suspected fracture or AVN not demonstrated by plain film radiography when MRI is not available or is contraindicated (eg, pacemaker, aneurysm clip). Bone scan is also indicated in the evaluation of metastatic disease, as well as prosthetic device loosening or infection. Radionuclide bone scan can survey a large area when performed as a whole-body exam; however, it is often nonspecific.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound (US) of the hip is readily available even at the bedside, allows dynamic evaluation of the tendons and muscles, and does not involve ionizing radiation; however, diagnostic performance is highly variable and operator- and patient-dependent. Hip effusions and bursal or periarticular fluid collections are readily identified. US is useful for guiding hip aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], injection of anesthetics and steroids into the hip joint or bursae, and soft tissue biopsies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasonography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasonography: Clinical applications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Image-guided injection with anesthetic and/or steroid'</a> below.)</p><p>In the appropriate clinical setting, US can be used to identify soft tissue hematoma and partial or complete muscle tears. Another indication for US is dynamic evaluation of the snapping iliopsoas syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Conventional plain film arthrography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The imaging indications for conventional plain film hip arthrography are now limited due to the increased use of MR hip arthrography, which visualizes joint anatomy as well as bone and surrounding soft tissues. However, limited conventional arthrography is useful to confirm intraarticular needle placement when hip aspiration is indicated for joint fluid analysis (eg, when septic arthritis or crystal induced synovitis is suspected). Aspiration and arthrography are also warranted when there is clinical suspicion of a prosthetic hip infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Image-guided injection with anesthetic and/or steroid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injection with anesthetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> steroid under fluoroscopic guidance is reserved for cases when imaging is inconclusive or demonstrates mild osteoarthritis (OA) and when referred pain is clinically suspected. Persistent pain, despite the injection of a local anesthetic, reduces the likelihood that hip pathology is the cause of pain and may obviate the need for further diagnostic imaging of the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Such injections are usually performed in addition to conventional hip arthrography and aspiration. Therapeutic injection of glucocorticoids into the hip joint can be done for acute and chronic inflammation associated with various arthritides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance arthrography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MR arthrography of the hip with intraarticular gadolinium administration best delineates the joint anatomy, including the acetabular labrum, articular cartilage, and ligamentum teres, and detects loose bodies. MR arthrography is used in cases of hip pain that may involve any of the above mentioned structures. Administration of gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents should be avoided in patients with severely impaired renal function (eg, estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-hip-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with hip pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Major categories of hip pathology include trauma, sports-related injuries, the bone marrow edema syndrome, osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis [AVN]), arthritis, the greater trochanteric pain syndrome, infection, tumor, and hip arthroplasty. Less common entities such as femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, nerve entrapment syndromes, and snapping hip syndrome are briefly addressed. Imaging in the evaluation of pediatric hip pain is presented in the context of individual disorders. A list of some entities that affect the hip in children of various ages is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-evaluation-of-the-hip-in-infants-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic evaluation of the hip in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hip trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute hip trauma is initially evaluated with plain film radiographs. Patients with a history of trauma for whom there is a high clinical index of suspicion of fracture, which is not apparent on plain radiographs, should be assessed further with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), depending on the type of fracture suspected.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiography &ndash; Plain film radiography is the initial imaging exam obtained for trauma or suspected fracture involving the hip and pelvis. Most fractures of the pelvis and hip joint, avulsion injuries, and dislocations will be identified on plain film. However, fractures involving the acetabulum, pelvic ring, or sacrum are occasionally difficult to detect on plain film radiography, and CT is recommended. Likewise, nondisplaced fractures, insufficiency fractures, or <span class=\"nowrap\">stress/incomplete</span> fractures of the femoral neck may not be seen on plain film, and MRI is recommended (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F75625\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75625 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F78263\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78263 \">image 2</a>). These advanced imaging modalities are indicated if the clinical suspicion remains high despite negative plain film radiography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT &ndash; CT has several indications in the evaluation of hip fractures and dislocation. CT is indicated in clinically suspected acetabular, pelvic ring, and sacral fractures not seen on plain radiographs. CT can demonstrate the cortical break, intraarticular loose bodies, fracture alignment, and underlying pathological bone. CT with multiplanar reconstruction is used for preoperative planning of hip fractures and assessment of nonunion femoral fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CT is valuable in assessing the direction of the hip dislocation when plain film is not conclusive, evaluating the extent of injury, and in treatment planning. In posterior hip dislocation, CT shows the associated posterior acetabular wall fractures, intraarticular loose bodies, or other mechanical blocks, which may interfere with closed reduction or result in instability after reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. CT is also indicated after closed reduction of all hip dislocations to assess for associated fractures, residual subluxation, and osteochondral fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CT may not detect trabecular bone injuries seen in insufficiency fractures of the femoral neck; these are best detected by MRI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; MRI is indicated for detection of radiographically occult fractures, such as stress and insufficiency fractures of the femoral neck, intertrochanteric fractures, and subtrochanteric fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F75625\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75625 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F78263\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78263 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>] Pelvic MRI evaluation will show any additional pelvic insufficiency fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F54969\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54969 \">image 3</a>), avulsion fractures, bone contusions, and muscle and sciatic nerve injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/2,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12-14</a>]. MRI will demonstrate the full extent of a fracture, such as a greater trochanteric fracture, which may appear simple on plain radiography, to determine if surgical intervention is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Accuracy of MRI for detecting occult hip fracture is reported to be 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], which can be achieved using T1-weighted coronal sequence alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, for early detection of associated edema and soft tissue injury, a fluid sensitive sequence is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the follow-up of femoral neck fracture and dislocation, MRI performed at three months is useful in detecting AVN, which is a potential complication from damage to the circumflex femoral artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radionuclide Tc-99m bone scan &ndash; Radionuclide Tc-99m (technetium methylene diphosphonate) bone scan is indicated in cases with suspected fracture and negative radiographs when MRI or CT is not available. The bone scan usually becomes positive within six hours; however, in older or osteopenic patients, there may be a delay of 48 hours after injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Sacral fractures have a characteristic appearance on bone scan and can be accurately diagnosed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MR arthrography &ndash; MR arthrography is indicated in the setting of persistent pain and clinical suspicion of acetabular labral tear, ligamentous or capsular injury, intraarticular loose bodies, and chondral injuries.

MRI is the modality of choice for early detection of stress fractures, which, in turn, prevents complications such as displacement of tensile fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. MRI of muscle injury may affect the decision for surgical repair and predict time to recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MR arthrography &ndash; MR arthrography is indicated in evaluation of suspected injuries to the acetabular labrum, ligamentum teres, detection of intraarticular loose bodies, and chondral defects.

The extent of involvement of the femoral head also correlates with the likelihood of success of early surgical interventions, such as core decompression. As an example, early-stage AVN involving less than 25 percent of the weightbearing portion of the femoral head treated by core decompression did not progress to collapse, whereas 87 percent of the cases involving more than 50 percent of the femoral head proceeded to collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteonecrosis-avascular-necrosis-of-bone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis of bone)&quot;</a>).

Imaging with In-111-labeled leukocytes is advocated for detection of osteomyelitis in patients with underlying bone pathology or prosthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT &ndash; CT is indicated in chronic osteomyelitis to evaluate the extent of the disease such as sequestrum, involucrum, cloacae, and sinus tract and soft tissue swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/71,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,73</a>].

MRI can distinguish between paraarticular soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis. MRI is more valuable than CT in chronic osteomyelitis because it demonstrates activity of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone or soft tissue tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain film radiography is the first imaging modality employed in patients who present with suspected mass lesions in the region of the hip. Further evaluation of bone tumors is facilitated by CT, while MRI is the modality of choice for evaluation of soft tissue tumors. The American College of Radiology has published appropriateness criteria for evaluation of primary bone tumors and soft tissue masses, based upon clinical and radiographic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiography &ndash; Plain film is the initial modality of choice for detection and assessment of the general features of bone tumor. Accuracy of plain film for detection of soft tissue tumors is limited. Plain film is the most valuable method to evaluate the margin characteristic of bone tumor (zone of transition), which is the important distinguishing feature between benign and malignant bone lesions. Plain film radiography also demonstrates the extent of cortical destruction, periosteal reaction, matrix calcifications, and pathological fractures. Certain radiographic patterns, combined with the age of the patient, can be very suggestive of specific tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT &ndash; CT is the best method for detection of lesions not optimally seen by plain film. CT provides better assessment of cortical invasion, pathological fracture, periosteal reaction, matrix mineralization, and detection of cystic or fatty nature of tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F67177\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67177 \">image 13</a>). CT is used for biopsy guidance and preoperative evaluation. CT is the best imaging technique for identification and localization of the nidus of the osteoid osteoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; MRI is nonspecific for differentiation of most tumors. MRI is the modality of choice for local staging, for definition of medullary and extracortical spread, and for the delineation of tumor in relation to critical neurovascular structures. The zone of transition, an important feature in plain film imaging, as discussed above, is not valid on MRI. Gadolinium administration is useful to differentiate solid from cystic or necrotic tumor, to evaluate responses to nonsurgical therapy, and to detect tumor recurrence. Gadolinium administration may be useful for differentiation of benign from malignant soft tissue tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. As noted earlier, administration of gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents should be avoided in patients with moderately to severely impaired renal function (eg, estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If gadolinium-based imaging must be performed in a patient with moderately to severely impaired renal function, there may be a role for dialysis to reduce the risk of development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NFS).

Plain film is the first method in the evaluation of hip arthroplasty; however, CT, MRI, radionuclide scintigraphy, ultrasonography, aspiration, and arthrography all have different roles in the assessment of the painful hip prosthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of total hip arthroplasty&quot;</a>.) The American College of Radiology has published appropriateness criteria for imaging after total hip arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Complications of total hip arthroplasty can be grouped into aseptic loosening and osteolysis, dislocation, infection, periprosthetic fracture, hardware failure, and heterotopic ossification. Heterotopic ossification that occurs in muscle is also known as myositis ossificans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of total hip arthroplasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Serial radiographs are the most important modality in assessing the hip prosthesis. Most management decisions can be made based on serial plain film findings without resorting to more complex imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Aseptic loosening and osteolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loosening of hip prosthesis due to mechanical factors (aseptic loosening) is the most common complication leading to revision surgery. Osteolysis is caused by particle disease resulting from wear of the polyethylene (PE) liner of the acetabulum. The PE debris incites a granulomatous reaction in the adjacent bone, resulting in erosion and cyst-like changes in the periprosthetic bone, leading to loosening. In addition, patients can develop cyst-like regions of fluid or soft tissue density material that protrude into the periacetabular region and communicate with the hip joint (pseudomembrane or pseudobursae formation).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiography &ndash; Plain film radiography is indicated in routine evaluation of the prosthetic hip and for assessing complications of hip arthroplasty. Postoperative radiographic follow-up in asymptomatic patients is routinely recommended at one, three, and five years, and every five years thereafter. In symptomatic patients in whom loosening is suspected, the initial exam should be a plain radiograph. Comparison with prior imaging is of utmost importance. Radiolucent areas greater than 2 mm adjacent to the prosthesis and progressive changes in follow-up radiographs are highly suspicious for loosening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F56858\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56858 \">image 15</a>). Other signs of loosening include development of bony sclerosis adjacent to the distal tip of prosthesis (pedestal formation) and evidence of prosthesis movement. Osteolysis related to particle disease is seen as focal, well-defined radiolucencies and smooth endosteal scalloping around the acetabular or femoral component.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT &ndash; Multidetector CT (MDCT) with a special technique to reduce metallic artifact is more sensitive than plain film radiographs for evaluation of the prosthesis. For a cemented acetabular component, the presence of linear radiolucencies more than a few millimeters in width is suggestive of loosening. In a non-cemented acetabular component, large cysts surrounding the acetabular component may indicate particle-induced osteolysis. CT can also visualize the associated pseudomembrane formation and the amount of remaining trabecular bone at the rim of the acetabular component. For the femoral component, CT can visualize subsidence (inferior migration of the femoral stem relative to the shaft) and &quot;bead shedding&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. CT can be helpful in evaluating the femoral and acetabular bone stock prior to revision surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI &ndash; MRI with optimization of image quality for correction of metallic hardware artifact is valuable in differentiating the soft tissue masses surrounding the prosthesis, which can be related to histiocytic osteolysis (particle disease) or infected fluid collections, by demonstrating different signal intensities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/79,82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,82,83</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional plain film arthrography &ndash; Arthrography is occasionally performed to evaluate suspected loosening of arthroplasty; however, its accuracy is limited by many false-negatives and false-positives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Arthrography can detect painful pseudobursae formation and can be used for aspiration and injection of local anesthetic or steroid for symptomatic relief.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasonography &ndash; Ultrasonography can detect pseudobursae formation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12209584\"><span class=\"h3\">Pseudotumors and metal-on-metal resurfacing arthroplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In younger patients, hip resurfacing arthroplasty has been utilized as an alternative to conventional arthroplasty. These implants consist of metal-on-metal articulations, leading to small wear particles being released. These particles cause lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates, termed aseptic lymphocytic vasculitis-associated lesions. These infiltrates may be associated with periarticular fluid collections or masses, also termed &quot;pseudotumors.&quot; Although pseudotumors have been reported most frequently in association with metal-on-metal hip implants, these pseudotumors are simply an additional manifestation of particle disease, and, therefore, they may be seen in hip arthroplasties of any type, including metal-on-polyethylene implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

Dislocation is diagnosed on plain film radiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F98926\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98926 \">image 16</a>). CT can better assess the integrity of the acetabular component (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F98925\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98925 \">image 17</a>).

A detailed discussion of the imaging modalities that may be used are discussed separately (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1529200\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Periprosthetic fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periprosthetic fracture is more common in the femoral component than the acetabular component and is more common in revision hip than in primary arthroplasty. Periprosthetic fracture can occur during placement of the femoral stem or any time after hip replacement, typically at the level of the tip of the femoral stem. Diagnosis is made by plain film radiography. MRI can also identify associated soft tissue injuries such as avulsion of the abductor muscles from the greater trochanter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h3\">Hardware failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hardware failure can affect both the femoral and acetabular components. The stem of the femoral component can break, representing a metal fatigue stress fracture. &quot;Bead shedding&quot; in non-cemented hip prosthesis (dislodgement of the metal spheres sintered to the femoral metal stem) can be visualized as aggregate clumps of beads on CT, indicating hardware failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. The superior aspect of the PE liner of the acetabulum can gradually wear down, resulting in asymmetric superior location of the femoral head within the acetabulum. In addition to gradual wear, the PE liner can break and separate from the metal acetabular shell, resulting in direct contact between the femoral head and acetabular metal component. Anteroposterior radiograph is diagnostic for evaluation of PE liner wear in 95 percent of cases. Arthrography can also show displaced intraarticular pieces of broken PE liner.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h3\">Heterotopic calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heterotopic calcification within the soft tissues surrounding the arthroplasty is a more common but less significant complication of total hip replacement, which can be easily diagnosed with plain film radiography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve entrapment syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The piriformis syndrome usually is caused by a neuritis of the proximal sciatic nerve. Spasm or contracture of the piriformis muscle can either irritate or compress the proximal sciatic nerve and can mimic discogenic sciatica (pseudosciatica). Hamstring syndrome is caused by tight tendinous structures of the hamstring muscle at its insertion on the ischial tuberosity, causing pain in this area radiating down the back of the thigh. Hip arthroplasty is one of the causes of nerve entrapment syndromes. These syndromes are evaluated by MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. MRI will often show sciatic nerve inflammation in the area of piriformis muscle in the piriformis syndrome and between the semitendinosus and biceps femoris muscles in hamstring syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Snapping hip syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Snapping hip syndrome is a benign condition that results from slippage of the iliotibial band or gluteus maximus muscle over the greater trochanter (external snapping hip syndrome) or slippage of the iliopsoas tendon over the iliopectineal eminence or the femoral head (internal snapping hip syndrome). Evaluation of the snapping hip syndrome is performed with a combination of plain radiography and ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/imaging-evaluation-of-the-painful-hip-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Plain films can also identify causes of referred hip pain, such as sacroiliitis, but may not detect or accurately characterize some hip fractures and bone marrow edema associated with early avascular necrosis (AVN) or early osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Plain film radiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) of the hip without intravenous contrast is most useful in the setting of trauma, for preoperative planning, and for evaluation and guiding percutaneous biopsy of tumors. Intravenous contrast is administered for evaluating a septic joint or a soft tissue abscess.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CT can detect the intraarticular extension of fractures. CT may not detect trabecular bone injuries, which may be present in femoral neck insufficiency fractures in osteoporotic patients, and will not demonstrate the bone marrow edema of early osteonecrosis and early osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Computerized tomography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip accurately evaluates the bone marrow, joint space, neurovascular structures, and soft tissues. Intravenous contrast is usually not administered except for evaluation of soft tissue and bone tumors or vascular malformations. MRI is the modality of choice for suspected femoral fracture not demonstrated radiographically, osteochondral injuries, muscle injuries, joint effusion, early diagnosis and staging of AVN, iliopsoas and intertrochanteric bursitis, evaluation of infection, and tumor. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radionuclide Tc-99m (technetium methylene diphosphonate) bone scan surveys a large area when performed as a whole-body exam; however, it is often nonspecific. Radionuclide bone scan is reserved for suspected fracture or AVN not demonstrated by plain film radiography when MRI is not available or is contraindicated and in the evaluation of metastatic disease and prosthetic device loosening or infection. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Radionuclide Tc-99m bone scan'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasound (US) of the hip is readily available even at the bedside, allows dynamic evaluation of the tendons and muscles, and does not involve ionizing radiation; however, its diagnostic performance is highly variable and operator- and patient-dependent. Hip effusions and bursal or periarticular fluid collections are readily identified. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The imaging indications for conventional plain film hip arthrography are now limited due to the increased use of MR arthrography, which visualizes joint anatomy as well as bone and surrounding soft tissues, but may be useful to confirm intraarticular needle placement when hip aspiration is indicated for joint fluid analysis. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Conventional plain film arthrography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection of the hip with anesthetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> steroid under fluoroscopic guidance is reserved for cases when imaging is inconclusive or demonstrates mild osteoarthritis (OA) and when referred pain is clinically suspected. Persistent pain despite the injection of a local anesthetic reduces the likelihood that hip pathology is the cause of pain and may obviate the need for further diagnostic imaging of the hip. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Image-guided injection with anesthetic and/or steroid'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MR arthrography of the hip with intraarticular gadolinium administration best delineates the joint anatomy, including the acetabular labrum, articular cartilage, and ligamentum teres, and detects loose bodies. Administration of gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents should be avoided in patients with severely impaired renal function. CT arthrography with intraarticular iodinated contrast is used in cases where the use of MR arthrography is contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Computerized tomography arthrography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance arthrography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The imaging modality used in a given patient depends upon the differential diagnosis that has been developed based upon the history and physical examination. The conditions for which the choice of imaging exam is reviewed here include trauma, sports-related injuries, the bone marrow edema syndrome, osteonecrosis, arthritis, the greater trochanteric pain syndrome, infection, tumor, hip arthroplasty, femoroacetabular impingement syndrome, nerve entrapment syndromes, and snapping hip syndrome.
