A related infection, called &quot;herpangina,&quot; causes sores to form in the mouth. Both infections most often affect children, but adults can get them, too. This article is about hand, foot, and mouth disease, but herpangina and hand, foot, and mouth disease are treated the same.</p><p>Hand, foot, and mouth disease usually goes away on its own within 2 to 3 days. There are treatments to help with its symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5696205\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is sores that form in the mouth, and on the hands, feet, buttocks, and sometimes the genitals. They can look like small red spots, bumps, or blisters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F103388\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103388 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F103389\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103389 \">picture 2</a>). The sores in the mouth can make swallowing painful. The sores on the hands and feet might be painful. It is possible to get the sores only in some areas. Not every person gets them on their hands, feet, and mouth.</p><p>The infection sometimes causes fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5696220\"><span class=\"h1\">How does hand, foot, and mouth disease spread?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The virus that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease can travel in body fluids of an infected person. For example, the virus can be found in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucus from the nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saliva</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid from one of the sores</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traces of bowel movements</p><p/><p>People with hand, foot, and mouth disease are most likely to spread the infection during the first week of their illness. But the virus can live in their body for weeks or even months after the symptoms have gone away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5696237\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hand, foot, and mouth disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, but it is not usually necessary. The doctor or nurse should be able to tell if your child has it by learning about your child's symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5696252\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my child's doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should call your child's doctor or nurse if your child is drinking less than usual and hasn't had a wet diaper for 4 to 6 hours (for babies and young children) or hasn't needed to urinate in the past 6 to 8 hours (for older children). You should also call your child's doctor or nurse if your child seems to be getting worse or isn't getting better after a few days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5696267\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hand, foot, and mouth disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infection itself is not treated. It usually goes away on its own within a few days. But children who are in pain can take nonprescription medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) to relieve pain. Never give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> to a child younger than 18 years. In children, aspirin can cause a serious problem called Reye syndrome.</p><p>The sores in the mouth can make swallowing painful, so some children might not want to eat or drink. It is important to make sure that children get enough fluids so that they don't get dehydrated. Cold foods, like popsicles and ice cream, can help to numb the pain. Soft foods, like pudding and gelatin, might be easier to swallow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5696282\"><span class=\"h1\">Can hand, foot, and mouth disease be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The most important thing you can do to prevent the spread of this infection is to wash your hands often with soap and water, even after your child is feeling better. You should teach your children to wash often, especially after using the bathroom. It's also important to keep your home clean and to disinfect tabletops, toys, and other things that a child might touch.</p><p>If your child has hand, foot, and mouth disease, keep him or her out of school or day care if he or she has a fever or doesn't feel well enough to go. You should also keep your child home if he or she is drooling a lot or has open sores.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
