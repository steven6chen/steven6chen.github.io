In that setting, surgical excision is curative in most cases, and patients at high risk of developing metastatic disease may benefit from adjuvant immunotherapy or targeted therapy for those with a <em>BRAF</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecularly-targeted-therapy-for-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Approaches that have been shown to provide clinically important benefit for appropriately selected patients with disseminated melanoma include immunotherapy with high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2), immunotherapy with antibodies targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> (a monoclonal antibody targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 [CTLA-4]), and inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway in patients whose tumors contain a V600 mutation in the <em>BRAF</em> gene using either a BRAF inhibitor or an MEK inhibitor. There are no randomized trials that compare targeted therapy with immunotherapy, and there are no prospective data on the appropriate sequencing of these therapies for patients with a <em>BRAF</em><em><sup>V600</sup></em> mutation.</p><p>The use of targeted therapies in the treatment of advanced melanoma will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H615776956\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An understanding of the role of activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway has led to the identification of several drug targets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53134 \">figure 1</a>). This is resulting in the development of important therapeutic approaches for the treatment of advanced melanoma in various patient subsets.

Testing for NRAS in patients with wild-type <em>BRAF</em> should also be considered. Patients with an acral or mucosal primary tumor and those with melanoma in an area of chronically sun-exposed skin that does not contain a <em>BRAF</em> mutation should have their tumor assessed for the presence of a driver mutation in <em>KIT</em>. Next-generation sequencing platforms can provide information on <em>NRAS</em> and <em>KIT</em> mutational status as well as identify alternative mutations in <em>BRAF</em> and <em>NF1</em> that could potentially be targetable. This approach should be considered in patients with wild-type <em>BRAF</em> melanoma whose disease has progressed on immunotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in those patients who are not candidates for immunotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2942639395\"><span class=\"h1\">BRAF-MUTATED TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activating mutations in <em>BRAF</em> are present in approximately 40 to 60 percent of advanced melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecularly-targeted-therapy-for-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In 80 to 90 percent of cases, this activating mutation consists of the substitution of glutamic acid for valine at amino acid 600 (V600E mutation), with most of the remainder consisting of an alternate substitution (lysine for valine) at the V600 locus (V to K).</p><p>BRAF inhibitors represent an important advance in the treatment of metastatic melanoma for patients whose tumors contain the characteristic activating <em>BRAF</em> mutation. Although the impact of these agents was originally demonstrated using single-agent therapy, combinations with MEK inhibitors have largely replaced single-agent BRAF inhibition. (See <a href=\"#H1230469891\" class=\"local\">'Combined MEK plus BRAF inhibition'</a> below.)</p><p>In one study, advanced melanomas with a mutation in <em>BRAF</em> appear to have some clinical differences that are associated with a more aggressive clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecularly-targeted-therapy-for-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a consecutive series of 197 patients at a single institution, the presence of mutant <em>BRAF</em> was significantly more frequent in patients with a truncal primary, an earlier age of onset, and a lack of chronic skin damage. Furthermore, for patients not treated with a BRAF inhibitor, survival was shorter overall.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100472985\"><span class=\"h2\">BRAF inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vemurafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vemurafenib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabrafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabrafenib</a>, inhibitors of BRAF, have demonstrated dramatic antitumor activity in phase III trials in patients with advanced disease whose tumors have characteristic mutations in <em>BRAF</em>. However, virtually every patient treated with an inhibitor of BRAF eventually has disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecularly-targeted-therapy-for-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Additional data will be required to determine whether different agents have a differential effect depending upon the specific mutation present.</p><p>In an analysis from the large, phase II, single-arm BRIM-2 trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vemurafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vemurafenib</a>, tumor samples were centrally collected and analyzed for mechanisms of resistance through use of Sequenom mutation analysis, Sanger DNA sequencing of <em>MEK1</em> exons 2, 3, and 6, and immunohistochemistry for activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecularly-targeted-therapy-for-metastatic-melanoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Nearly all tumors demonstrated reactivation of the MAP kinase pathway with elevation of pERK at the time of resistance. In some patients, progression was associated with an additional <em>NRAS</em><em><sup>Q61</sup></em><sup> </sup>mutation. In a small subset of patients, several <em>MEK1</em> mutations were found in association with resistance, which was the first time these mutations were found in patient tumor samples. These included <em>MEK1</em><em><sup>Q56</sup></em> and <em>MEK1</em><em><sup>E203</sup></em> mutations. On the other hand <em>MEK1</em><em><sup>P124L</sup></em><em> </em>was not associated with resistance and was seen de novo.

Vemurafenib prolonged both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival as a single agent in melanoma patients whose tumors contain a V600 mutation.

(See <a href=\"#H615776956\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a V600E or V600K mutation predicts responsiveness to BRAF inhibitors or MEK inhibition. Three agents have demonstrated significant clinical benefit and have been approved for use in patients with <em>BRAF</em> mutations: the BRAF inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vemurafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vemurafenib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabrafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabrafenib</a> and the MEK inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trametinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trametinib</a>. There are no clinical trials comparing these three agents with each other; however, data suggest that the BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib are more active than the MEK inhibitor trametinib. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib appear to have similar clinical activity, so the choice between those two agents will likely be based on other factors, including their distinct toxicity profiles. (See <a href=\"#H100472992\" class=\"local\">'Vemurafenib'</a> above and <a href=\"#H100472999\" class=\"local\">'Dabrafenib'</a> above and <a href=\"#H175767667\" class=\"local\">'Trametinib'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with a <em>BRAF</em><em><sup>V600E</sup></em> or <em>BRAF</em><em><sup>V600K</sup></em> mutation, the combination of a BRAF inhibitor and an MEK inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabrafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabrafenib</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trametinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trametinib</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vemurafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vemurafenib</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cobimetinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cobimetinib</a>) has a longer progression-free survival, higher objective response rate, and longer overall survival compared with a BRAF inhibitor alone. The combination is also associated with significantly less skin toxicity, but greater pyrexia and chills (for <span class=\"nowrap\">dabrafenib/trametinib)</span> and other side effects, including creatine kinase elevations, visual problems, and bleeding risk (for <span class=\"nowrap\">vemurafenib/cobimetinib)</span>. For patients who are candidates for targeted therapy, we recommend starting with a combination of a BRAF inhibitor and an MEK inhibitor rather than a single agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1230469891\" class=\"local\">'Combined MEK plus BRAF inhibition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether patients with <em>BRAF</em><em><sup>V600</sup></em>-mutant melanoma should receive immunotherapy or molecularly targeted therapy as initial systemic therapy is unclear. For patients with a <em>BRAF</em><em><sup>V600</sup></em> mutation and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, we suggest enrollment in the EA6134 protocol (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02224781?term=ea6134&rank=1&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPNRk6RsQhudds+c6LOgewGByQp1ZEzupX2TVqBA00EOXdZlILcYZqjuUbyWRVC/bLc=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15408\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02224781</a>) or a similar study to formally address the question of whether initial treatment with immunotherapy or targeted therapy is preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma#H863137387\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of advanced cutaneous melanoma&quot;, section on 'Choice and sequence of therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with a <em>BRAF</em><em><sup>V600</sup></em> mutation who were initially treated with immunotherapy and whose disease can no longer be controlled with immunotherapy, we recommend targeted therapy rather than chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted therapy with BRAF inhibitors is not indicated in patients without a characteristic <em>BRAF</em><em><sup>V600</sup></em> mutation.
