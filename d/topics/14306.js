Depending on an individual's history of gender-affirming care, primary and preventive care may require special considerations. Transgender patients often experience discrimination in the health care setting and lack of access to medical personnel competent in transgender medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. This results in lack of access to preventive health services and timely treatment of routine health problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide an overview for providing primary care to transgender patients. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis as well as the hormonal and surgical treatment of transgender patients are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transgender-women-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transgender women: Evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transgender-men-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transgender men: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1590377\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;transgender&quot; is generally used to describe a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity or expression differs from that assigned at birth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86993\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86993 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Primary care providers should be familiar with commonly used terms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86993\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86993 \">table 1</a>) and the diversity of identities within the transgender community. Natal sex refers to the sex the patient was assigned at birth. For example, transgender women (male to female, MTF) have a female gender identity and were assigned a male sex at birth and transgender men (female to male, FTM) have a male gender identity and were assigned a female sex at birth. Individuals who identify elsewhere along the spectrum of the <span class=\"nowrap\">masculine/feminine</span> gender may use other terms. Gender-affirming care includes hormone therapy and gender-related surgeries, as well as other procedures, such as hair removal or speech therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H493316368\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of the primary care provider for transgender patients includes the tasks typical for all patients (eg, primary and secondary prevention), in addition to the specific needs of transgendered individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For example, primary care clinicians may be involved in providing medical documentation of a patient's gender, navigating insurance coverage for gender-related interventions, and providing letters for change of gender on identification (eg, passport, driver's license). Referrals may also be sought for gender-affirming surgeries, voice therapy, hair removal through laser or electrolysis, or hair transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Not every primary care clinician will be able to offer all elements of comprehensive transgender care; however, every clinician can become comfortable in working with transgender patients to meet their healthcare needs, including gender-affirming interventions. It is important that primary care providers be aware that patients may vary widely in terms of anatomy and hormonal status when they present, and these attributes may further change over time.</p><p>Hormone therapy may be managed by specialists or primary care providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Those that do not manage hormone therapy should be aware of common medications and doses used in hormone therapy, along with potential side effects. Finally, primary care providers should become knowledgeable regarding appropriate postsurgical self-care after genital surgeries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transgender-women-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transgender women: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H493316388\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Providers should refer to transgender patients by their preferred name and pronouns, reassure them about confidentiality, and educate frontline and other clinical staff regarding these issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H493316394\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive history may not be possible in one visit. History gathering should take place over time to build trust with the patient. In general, the history is similar to that of non-transgender patients. History that is specifically important for transgender patients includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gender-related hormonal and surgical interventions</strong> &ndash; A thorough history of past and current gender-related hormonal use and surgical interventions is essential. Clinicians should also ask if the patient plans to pursue hormone therapy or surgeries in the future. Awareness of future plans is useful in coordinating referrals and planning relating to care for any coexisting medical, social, or psychologic concerns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Past hormone use may have been medically supervised or unsupervised (often purchased on the internet or on the street). Medically unsupervised use is common among transgender patients with limited access to care, and patients may share needles in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients may use &quot;herbal hormones&quot; (eg, phytoestrogens or androgen-like compounds sold as dietary supplements such as red clover, black cohosh, and dehydroepiandrosterone). We also ask transgender women about the use of silicone injections (to their hips, buttocks, thighs, breasts, or face). These are often done without sterile technique and can increase risks for bloodborne infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Surgeries may include both sex reassignment procedures and those to masculinize or feminize facial and body contours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transgender-women-evaluation-and-management#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transgender women: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Gender confirmation surgery'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reproductive history</strong> &ndash; A gynecologic and obstetric history is important in transgender men (female to male, FTM). Providers may delay taking this history until they have established a trusting relationship with the patient. Studies suggest that polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and hyperandrogenicity are commonly found in transgender men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Family history</strong> &ndash; The family history is similar to that of non-transgender patients. For patients taking or considering hormone therapy, particular attention to familial conditions that may be affected by the use of estrogen or testosterone may be warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transgender-women-evaluation-and-management#H768005246\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transgender women: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Major adverse events'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transgender-women-evaluation-and-management#H1299179889\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transgender women: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Cautions when using estrogen therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transgender-men-evaluation-and-management#H4105974929\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transgender men: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Adverse events'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As with natal females, transgender men with known or suspected genetic mutations for breast and ovarian cancer should be referred for genetic counseling for testing and prevention options. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-and-testing-for-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling and testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sexual history</strong> &ndash; A sexual health history requires particular sensitivity for transgender patients. Discussion should be initiated gradually, and pacing should depend on patient comfort. A sexual history should cover sexual behaviors including assessing for any history of unprotected receptive anal intercourse, behaviors that increase risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs; eg, sex work), unintended pregnancy, and sexual function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F101897\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101897 \">table 2</a>). This history is important to determine what screening for STIs is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H30480466\" class=\"local\">'Sexually transmitted and bloodborne infections'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections#H602295897\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Assessing risk'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sexual practices vary greatly, and assumptions should not be made about the gender of a patient's sexual partner(s) or sexual activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Transgender individuals may have male or female partners, including other transgender partners. They may use their natal sex organs during sexual activity. Surveys and focus-group studies suggest that social marginalization, stigma, and the need to affirm one's gender identity can drive high-risk sexual behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Transgender individuals (of any gender) who have sex with men are more likely to practice condomless sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychiatric history</strong> &ndash; Patients should be assessed for mood disorders (especially depression and anxiety), substance use, and posttraumatic stress disorder (including a history of physical, sexual, or emotional trauma or abuse). Compared with non-transgender patients, transgender individuals have more symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as higher rates of suicidal ideation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These symptoms are often a result of longstanding experiences of oppression and denial of identity. One survey found that 41 percent of transgender and gender nonconforming respondents had attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-depression-in-adults#H22016477\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for depression in adults&quot;, section on 'Screening options'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H601612474\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H1036196772\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-assessment-of-substance-use-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical assessment of substance use disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Social history</strong> &ndash; The social history should include a review of a transgender patient's family, economic, and larger social environments, which can be sources of support or stress. Social isolation, rejection by family or community of origin, harassment, and discrimination can significantly impact a transgender individual's health. Additionally, for a variety of reasons, including housing and employment discrimination, transgender individuals have a higher rate of homelessness compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H493316406\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the gender identity of the patient, physical exams should be based on the organs present and the patient's presenting symptoms. Transgender patients may be uncomfortable with their bodies and find some elements of physical examination traumatic. Unless there is an immediate medical need, sensitive elements of the exam (particularly breast, pelvic, and rectal exams) should be delayed until strong clinician-patient rapport has developed. The physical exam provides an important opportunity to educate patients about their bodies and about the need for ongoing health maintenance.</p><p/><p>In the absence of hormone therapy, findings suggestive of intersex conditions (eg, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, abnormal androgen synthesis, or Turner syndrome) should be further evaluated as appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nonclassic-late-onset-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of nonclassic (late-onset) congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-hyperandrogenism#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenal hyperandrogenism&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>For patients on hormone therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who have had sex reassignment surgery, physical changes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transgender women (male to female, MTF) </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Feminizing physical changes vary depending on the length of time on hormones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54189 \">table 3</a>). These patients may have feminine breast shape and size, often with relatively underdeveloped nipples; breasts may appear fibrocystic if there have been silicone injections. Galactorrhea is sometimes seen in patients with high prolactin levels, especially among those using breast pumps to stimulate development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. There may be minimal body hair and variable facial hair (depending on length of time on hormones and hair removal treatments). Testicles may become small and soft; defects or hernias at the external inguinal ring may be present due to the practice of &quot;tucking&quot; the testicles up near (or into) the inguinal canal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transgender-women-evaluation-and-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transgender women: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Clinical outcomes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Gender-affirming surgical procedures for transgender women include bilateral orchiectomy, penectomy, the creation of a clitoris and neovagina, and breast augmentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transgender-women-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transgender women: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transgender man (female to male, FTM) </strong>&ndash; Masculinizing physical changes vary depending on the length of time on hormones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75101 \">table 4</a>). These patients may have beard growth, clitoromegaly, acne, and androgenic alopecia; those who have bound their breasts for many years may have rash or yeast infection of the skin under the breasts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transgender-men-evaluation-and-management#H2064991012\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transgender men: Evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Masculinizing effects'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Gender-affirming surgical procedures for transgender men include oophorectomy, hysterectomy, and vaginectomy. They may also undergo chest reconstruction (including mastectomy), metoidioplasty (creation of a microphallus), or phalloplasty (creation of a neophallus).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H493316412\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal values for transgender patients who are undergoing or have completed gender transition have not been established for any laboratory test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In the absence of laboratory determined reference ranges, clinicians should interpret values based on the hormonal status of the patient, noting that this may differ from the lab-reported reference range. For example, in transgender women, creatinine may remain elevated above the female upper limit of normal due to preserved muscle mass, and the lower normal limit for hematocrit may be expected to be somewhere between the female and male ranges (due to reduced testosterone). Conversely, for transgender men on hormone therapy, hematocrit might be expected to be in the male range due to amenorrhea and the erythropoietic effects of testosterone supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H493316424\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING/PREVENTIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recommendations for screening and prevention for transgender patients who have not been on hormonal therapy and had no surgery are the same as those of the general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Recommendations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-health-maintenance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric health maintenance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116426884\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific considerations in patients on hormones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have received hormones <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> undergone surgery, recommendations for screening and preventive care may depend on the patient's hormonal and surgical status. Specific issues, particularly screening for cancer (eg, breast, cervical, and prostate cancers) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F102596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102596 \">table 5</a>), are noted below. Unless noted, the screening and prevention recommendations are the same as the general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Recommendations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-health-maintenance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric health maintenance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Long-term prospective studies for most transgender health issues are lacking, resulting in variable preventive care recommendations based primarily on observational studies and expert opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/5,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26</a>]. In many areas, case reports or series are the best data. The best available evidence for mortality comes from observational studies. One study of a Netherlands historical cohort involved 966 transgender women and 365 transgender men patients, with hormone use of at least one year and median follow-up of 18.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Mortality for transgender women (male to female, MTF) was noted to be 51 percent higher than the general male population, mainly due to increased rates of death from suicide, drugs, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and, to a lesser extent, cardiovascular disease (CVD). The mortality for transgender men (female to male, FTM) was noted to be similar to women in the general population. Another retrospective study from the Veterans Health Administration including 5117 transgender patients found that the leading causes of death were related to diseases of the circulatory system and neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The study also found that the crude suicide rate among transgender veterans was higher than the general population but similar to the suicide rate for veterans with serious mental illness (eg, depression or schizophrenia).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116433814\"><span class=\"h3\">All transgender patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most screening and prevention for chronic diseases in transgender patients is the same as the general population.

Management of cardiovascular risk factors may decrease the hazards associated with long-term hormone therapy.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The long-term effects of feminizing hormone therapy on CVD are not clear. There is some evidence to suggest that it leads to an overall deleterious effect on CVD risk factors (eg, lipids and insulin sensitivity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Studies also suggest that feminizing hormone therapy may be associated with an increase in CVD morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/27,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,30-32</a>]. However, these studies may not have controlled for other CVD risk factors (eg, older age, smoking).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The effect of testosterone on CVD risk in transgender men is unclear. Studies have not shown an increase in cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/27,31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31,33</a>]. Masculinizing hormone therapy increases lipid parameters associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but studies have not shown negative effects on other risk factors, such as blood pressure and insulin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/26,30,32,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30,32,34</a>]. Specific considerations for transgender patients include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Smoking</strong> &ndash; Smoking prevalence is higher among transgender patients compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similar to non-transgender patients, we encourage smoking cessation.

In other patients, we follow screening guidelines for non-transgender patients, keeping in mind that transgender women on estrogen therapy may be at higher risk for diabetes because of increased insulin resistance, weight gain, and an increase in body fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/32,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,35-38</a>].

A Dutch observational study noted an increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus among transgender men and women in comparison with both age-matched, non-transgender male and female groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Oral estrogen therapy, both in postmenopausal women and transgender women, is known to increase triglycerides and has precipitated pancreatitis in a trans woman and postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. However, lipids are not routinely monitored yearly in women on hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therapy.

While there is no evidence to support clinical breast examinations in this population, we perform yearly chest wall and axillary exams. We use this as an opportunity to examine scar tissue and any changes and educate the patient about the small but possible risk of breast cancer. Transgender men who undergo breast reduction or mastectomy retain some degree of underlying breast tissue for good cosmetic result.

However, testosterone may affect the yield of Pap smear testing.

As testosterone therapy can result in atrophic dysplasia-like changes to the cervical epithelium, the pathologist should be informed of the patient's hormonal status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

For patients without any history of sexual activity involving vaginal penetration, it is reasonable to have an informed discussion with patients regarding the risks of deferring cervical cancer screening, which may vary depending on sexual behaviors. There is some evidence to suggest that the risk of human papillomavirus infection (and thus cervical cancer) in this population may be lower than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Options for treatment and improving comfort with procedures should be discussed with the patient.

To prevent condom breakage for vaginal penetrative intercourse, transgender women with a neovagina and transgender men on testosterone (who may have vaginal atrophy and dryness from decreased estrogen) should use supplemental lubrication. Water-based lubricants only should be used with latex barriers as oil-based products degrade latex.

While more medical providers have moved to a model of providing hormone therapy based on informed consent, a mental health assessment is still required for most surgical procedures; behavioral health providers have historically been the &quot;gatekeepers&quot; for medical and surgical interventions for transgender patients. This historical context of the relationship has resulted in many transgender patients being uncomfortable about the role of behavioral health providers in medical care, which may act as a barrier to care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-transgender-individuals/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].
