The ear canal is the part of the ear that goes from the side of the head to the eardrum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55121 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>An outer ear infection is sometimes called &quot;swimmer's ear.&quot; But an outer ear infection does not happen only in people who swim. People who do not swim can also get it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481201297\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes an outer ear infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An outer ear infection happens when the skin in the ear canal gets irritated or scratched, and then gets infected. This can happen when a person:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Puts cotton swabs, fingers, or other things inside the ear</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleans the ear canal to remove ear wax</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swims on a regular basis &ndash; Water can soften the ear canal, which allows germs to infect the skin more easily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wears hearing aids, headphones, or ear plugs that can hurt the skin inside the ear </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481201304\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an outer ear infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain inside the ear, especially when the ear is pulled or moved</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching inside the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid or pus leaking from the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble hearing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481201311\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for an outer ear infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and looking in your ear. During the visit, your doctor might clean out your ear so that it can heal more quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481201318\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an outer ear infection treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear drops &ndash; Be sure to finish all the medicine, even if you feel better after a few days. When you use ear drops, you should:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lie on your side or tilt your head</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Make sure the ear drops go into the ear canal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stay in the same position for 20 minutes (after the ear drops are in)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relieve pain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481201325\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do during treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to keep the inside of your ear dry while the infection heals. You should not swim for 7 to 10 days after starting treatment. But you can take a shower. To keep the ear dry during a shower, put some petroleum jelly (sample brand name: Vaseline) on a cotton ball, and then put the cotton ball in your outer ear, covering the opening of your ear canal. Do not push the cotton ball into the ear canal.</p><p>You should also avoid wearing hearing aids or headphones in the infected ear until your symptoms improve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481201332\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms get worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms are not better 2 days after starting treatment</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481201339\"><span class=\"h1\">Can an outer ear infection be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting an outer ear infection by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not sticking things in your ears or cleaning inside your ears &ndash; The inside of the ears do not usually need to be cleaned. It is normal to have some ear wax in your ears. Ear wax protects the ear canal. But if you are worried that you have too much ear wax, talk to your doctor or nurse. He or she can look in your ears and tell you how to clean them safely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following these tips if you swim a lot:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blow dry or shake your ears dry after you swim</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use ear drops that can prevent infections after you swim</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wear ear plugs to prevent water from getting in your ears. Keep the ear plugs clean and get new ones if your ear plugs are too dirty or start to fall apart.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481201346\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=removing-objects-stuck-in-the-ear-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Removing objects stuck in the ear (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-including-swimmers-ear-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: External otitis (including swimmer's ear) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
