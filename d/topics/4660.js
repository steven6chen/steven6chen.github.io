Crystal-induced AKI most commonly occurs as a result of acute uric acid nephropathy and following the administration of drugs or toxins that are poorly soluble or have metabolites that are poorly soluble in urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Other drugs or medications may be metabolized to insoluble products such as oxalate (ethylene glycol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a>), which are associated with precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals within tubular lumens and kidney injury.</p><p>This topic review discusses drug-related crystal-induced AKI.

Occasionally, patients present within one to seven days after initiation of the offending drug with renal colic symptoms such as flank or abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.</p><p>Urinalysis often reveals hematuria, pyuria, and crystalluria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Significant proteinuria (ie, &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> is not commonly observed, unless the patient has underlying proteinuric kidney disease and subsequently develops crystal-induced AKI.</p><p>The diagnosis is suggested by the appearance of crystals in the urine, the morphology of which depends upon the specific causative drug (see <a href=\"#H4164281\" class=\"local\">'Specific agents'</a> below). However, crystalluria may also be observed in patients who have no evidence of AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Definitive diagnosis is obtained by examination of histology obtained by biopsy. In general, however, a biopsy is not indicated in patients who present with AKI in the setting of starting a drug that is known to cause crystal-induced AKI, unless atypical features (such as significant proteinuria in a patient who does not have underlying proteinuric kidney disease) are present.</p><p>The differential diagnosis for crystal-induced AKI is AKI from any cause and, among patients who present with hematuria and even modest proteinuria, glomerulonephritis. The diagnostic approaches to these disorders are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glomerular-disease-evaluation-and-differential-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glomerular disease: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Crystal-induced AKI is generally reversed following discontinuation of the drug, although temporary dialysis may be necessary in some cases, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be a long-term consequence of crystal-induced AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4164217\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for crystal-induced kidney injury include true and &quot;effective&quot; intravascular volume depletion, underlying kidney or liver disease, and metabolic perturbations that change urinary pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]. The effect of urine pH on crystal formation varies depending upon the specific causative agents. As an example, whereas sulfonamides tend to form crystals in acidic urine, protease inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indinavir</a> form crystals in alkaline urine.</p><p>Excessive drug dosing for a given glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may contribute to the risk of kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101517554\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The correction of volume depletion is critical to prevent crystal-induced AKI among patients at risk. Therapy of established crystal-induced AKI is supportive and consists of volume repletion, usually with isotonic saline, and administration of a loop diuretic in an attempt to wash out the obstructing crystals. The use of loop diuretics is of theoretical benefit only, and its efficacy has not been shown. Despite the absence of proven efficacy, we generally administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>. Fluid loss induced by the diuretic must be replaced to prevent volume depletion and a late slowing of flow within the tubules.</p><p>In addition to volume repletion and loop diuretics, among patients with crystal-induced AKI due to specific medications (as, for example, sulfonamide antibiotics and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>), adjusting the urine pH to achieve better solubility of the crystal may be of benefit. These issues and specific treatments, where indicated, are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H4164288\" class=\"local\">'Sulfonamide antibiotics'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4164341\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4164281\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC AGENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101518418\"><span class=\"h2\">Acyclovir</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acyclovir</a> is rapidly excreted in the urine (being both filtered and secreted) and has a relatively low solubility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, bolus intravenous (IV) therapy, especially if the patient is volume depleted, may lead to the deposition of acyclovir crystals in the tubules, resulting in intratubular obstruction and foci of interstitial inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ganciclovir</a>, another antiviral agent that is structurally related to acyclovir and is also excreted in the urine, appears to be associated with a much lower risk of crystal-induced AKI compared with acyclovir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p>Renal function in affected patients typically begins to deteriorate within 24 to 48 hours after therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> is initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].<strong> </strong>Patients may complain of nausea and flank or abdominal pain at this time, presumably induced by the urinary tract obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In some cases, birefringent, needle-shaped acyclovir crystals, occasionally engulfed by white cells, can be seen in the urine, particularly under polarized light (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F114167\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114167 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>The decline in kidney function is usually mild but occasionally may be severe, with marked increases in the plasma creatinine concentration in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, complete recovery typically occurs within four to nine days after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> is discontinued.</p><p>It is likely that most cases of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> nephrotoxicity, which is likely due in part to direct tubular toxicity and in part to luminal crystal-associated obstruction, can be prevented by prior volume repletion (with the urine output maintained above 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour)</span> and slow IV drug infusion over one to two hours. We generally administer IV isotonic saline at a rate of 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour,</span> starting at least one hour prior to the administration of acyclovir and continuing for six hours after the acyclovir infusion is finished.

Oral therapy is usually well tolerated, presumably due to a less rapid rate of acyclovir excretion. Rarely, AKI can develop with oral acyclovir in patients with underlying kidney disease (and excessive dosing) and severe volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Therapy of established renal failure is supportive and consists of volume repletion, usually with isotonic saline and administration of a loop diuretic in an attempt to wash out the obstructing crystals. As noted above, although the use of loop diuretics is of theoretical benefit only and its efficacy has not been shown, we generally administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>. Fluid loss induced by the diuretic must be replaced to prevent volume depletion and a late slowing of flow within the tubules.

Alkalinization of the urine to a pH &gt;7.15 increases sulfadiazine solubility more than 20-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14</a>].</p><p>Sulfonamide crystals can assume many shapes, in part dependent upon the specific sulfonamide present. The most common morphology includes needle-shaped crystals, rosettes, and those resembling shocks of wheat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56708\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56708 \">picture 1</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sulfadiazine</a> sludge or small calculi in the calyces can also be detected in some cases as bilateral, layered clusters of echogenic material on renal ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>].</p><p>Intrarenal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfadiazine</a> precipitation may be prevented by maintaining fluid intake above 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day,</span> which may be administered orally or intravenously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients who are receiving sulfadiazine should be monitored by serial urinalyses for the development of crystalluria. Among patients who develop crystalluria, we administer an IV bicarbonate solution to alkalinize the urine to &ge;7.15 in order to prevent AKI. To patients who are euvolemic and have normal renal function and a normal serum sodium concentration, we give a solution containing 75 mEq <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> per liter of sterile water. If the patient is hypovolemic, we give an isotonic solution (containing 75 mEq sodium bicarbonate per liter of one-half isotonic saline). We generally give approximately 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> (ie, infusion rate of 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour)</span>.</p><p>Patients who are receiving prophylactic IV bicarbonate should be closely monitored by physical exam for volume overload and by daily measurement of serum creatinine and electrolytes for development of AKI, alkalosis, or other electrolyte abnormalities.</p><p>Some patients may develop AKI despite prophylactic volume repletion and alkalinization of urine. Among such patients, AKI usually resolves when the sulfonamide is discontinued. The treatment of established AKI is supportive. Volume depletion, if present, should be treated in all patients, usually with isotonic saline. The administration of loop diuretics may assist recovery of renal function by clearing obstructive casts from tubular lumen, although there are no published data that have demonstrated a benefit of loop diuretics.</p><p>Among patients with established AKI, a forced alkaline diuresis to a target urine pH &gt;7.15 may provide benefit by increasing the solubility of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfadiazine</a>, although there are no published studies that show that this treatment reverses or limits the duration of established sulfonamide-associated AKI.</p><p>In addition to a lack of clear evidence of benefit, maintaining the urine pH &gt;7.15 is difficult in patients with established AKI. There are also potential risks to alkalinization of the plasma, such as promoting calcium phosphate deposition (which is more likely if hyperphosphatemia is present) and inducing or worsening the manifestations of hypocalcemia by both a direct membrane effect and a reduction in ionized calcium levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/crystal-induced-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].
