Contingency management is typically delivered as an augmentation to psychosocial treatment such as SUD counseling or cognitive-behavioral therapy.</p><p>Contingency management uses incentives to encourage treatment attendance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abstinence from <span class=\"nowrap\">alcohol/drug</span> use. Contingency management interventions can be customized to some extent to address patient preferences or program needs, such as the resources available for the intervention.</p><p>This topic describes the efficacy, implementation, and training for contingency management. The theoretical foundation, indications, assessment, and components of contingency management for SUD are discussed separately. Other SUD treatments, including those for specific substances, are also discussed separately.

Given the current acute care model for addiction treatment, it is advisable to maximize the amount of time incentives are in place and combine contingency management interventions with other psychosocial interventions that target sustained abstinence following the removal of incentives. </p><p>Clinical trial findings for abstinence by type of substance are described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1870898\"><span class=\"h3\">Stimulants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence for the efficacy of contingency management is strongest for stimulants among types of substances. Stimulant abuse and dependence were the sole or primary SUDs in the majority of trials included in the two meta-analyses described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

Another approach is to customize incentives so that all clients have an opportunity to earn the same amount but based on individualized goals within their treatment plan, including abstinence. Reinforcement of goal-related activities has been included in research designs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training/abstract/57,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,80</a>], but the complexity of the approach makes it difficult to systematically study efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345365\"><span class=\"h3\">Remitted versus active drug users</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We favor prioritizing patients who are actively using drugs at the start of an SUD treatment program, identified by positive urine test results at intake <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> early in treatment, for abstinence-based incentives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The prioritizing of active users would apply whether or not medication (eg, for opioid dependence) is part of the treatment regimen. Patients with active use at the start of outpatient psychosocial counseling treatment are the ones that have been found to benefit by reducing or stopping drug use from incentive treatment that targets abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training/abstract/33,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,81</a>]. By contrast, patients with an SUD who enter treatment already abstinent from drugs (ie, with negative urine tests at intake or early in treatment) have been found to remain abstinent at high rates over the course of treatment whether or not they receive abstinence incentives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training/abstract/10,33,81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,33,81,82</a>].</p><p>In those who test drug-negative at the start of treatment, it may be possible to use non-monetary rewards such as certificates or public acclaim (as done in Alcoholics <span class=\"nowrap\">Anonymous/Narcotics</span> Anonymous self-help programs) to reinforce abstinence and other positive behaviors among patients who do not receive financial incentives. Alternatively, provision of financial incentives for attendance or other goal-related behaviors is likely to increase attendance and lengthen treatment retention, which may in turn improve long-term outcomes. For these patients, continued intermittent urine testing is suggested to detect any drug use lapses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], with abstinence incentives added to the treatment plan as needed to forestall future relapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1872703\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials of contingency management have typically focused on abstinence from a single drug rather than from multiple drugs in polysubstance users, but available research suggests that incentives are more effective targeting one substance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Contingency management is, however, compatible with the usual clinical recommendation of abstinence from all drugs. Use of other drugs frequently declines when a primary drug is targeted. As an example, in patients with cocaine and opioid use treated in a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> maintenance program, where cocaine has been targeted as a single drug, concurrent reduction in non-targeted opiate use has typically been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The question of how many drugs should be targeted for a given individual remains somewhat controversial. Clinical efficacy depends on targeting at minimum the primary drug that brought the patient to treatment, particularly if there is evidence of ongoing use of that drug. Targeting a single drug with escalating reinforcement makes the program more manageable and provides patients the opportunity to experience success. The use of bonuses to reward abstinence from non-targeted drugs broadens the clinical focus and is a common strategy used in research studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1872783\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contingency management is typically provided for durations between 8 and 16 weeks.

Epidemiological research suggests that continuous abstinence for at least three years may be necessary before the risk of relapse stabilizes at very low levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].
