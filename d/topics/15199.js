However, it is now realized that OA results from a complex interplay of multiple factors, including joint integrity, genetics, local inflammation, mechanical forces, and cellular and biochemical processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A discussion of how these factors interact to cause cartilage loss and related bony changes is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, inherited conditions may predispose individuals to develop OA. For the majority of patients, OA is linked to one or more factors, such as aging, occupation, trauma, and repetitive, small insults over time. These associations are strongest for OA of the knee and hand and are less strong for the hip. How these factors interact with genetics and other factors in the development of OA remains unclear.</p><p>The risk factors for and possible causes of OA will be reviewed here. Clinical manifestations, classification, and diagnosis are presented separately.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found the prevalence of this disease to be less than 0.1 percent in those aged 25 to 34 years old versus a rate of over 80 percent in people over age 55 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. These findings are consistent with those of early studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1958, a study found OA in 83 and 87 percent of males and females aged 55 to 64 years old, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1973, age-related increases in OA were reported in both men (incident OA of 9.4 percent in those aged 15 to 24 versus 97 percent in those over age 65) and women (incident OA of 7.6 percent in those aged 15 to 24 versus 97 percent in patients at age 65 and over) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">FEMALE SEX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Innumerable studies have found that female sex is associated with an increased risk of osteoarthritis (OA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. The relative risk of developing OA for women has been estimated to be 2.6 after adjustment for age, weight, and smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Women with OA are also more likely than men to experience rapid structural damage and to undergo total hip arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The reason for these increased risks in women remains unclear, but it may be related to hormones, genetics, or other undetermined factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">OBESITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obesity is perhaps the strongest modifiable risk factor for the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Although multiple studies have demonstrated a relationship between obesity and OA, newer studies better define this association and its implications on the prevention of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/3-6,8,10-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6,8,10-18</a>].</p><p>Since the association of obesity as a risk factor for OA varies by joint, the following review will be conducted according to the principle affected anatomic areas in OA: the knees, hands, and hips.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Knee</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Utilizing data from the Chingford study, two studies have quantified a strong association between obesity and OA of the knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19</a>]. In these studies, height, weight, waist, and the circumference of the hips and mid-thigh were measured, and subjects were divided into tertiles based on body mass index (BMI). Women of age 45 to 64 were considered to have OA if their Kellgren and Lawrence score was two or greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19</a>].</p><p>When compared with the lowest obesity tertile, patients in the highest tertile in one of the studies had an odds ratio (OR) of 6.17 for radiographic OA and 8.57 for radiographic and symptomatic OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. For every two-unit increase in BMI (equivalent to approximately 5 kilograms), the OR for radiographic knee OA increased by 1.36. The distribution of fat, however, was not found to be significant. Limitations of the study include its cross-sectional nature and the predominance of Caucasians.</p><p>A follow-up, longitudinal study of this patient population evaluated the risk for the development of contralateral knee OA in middle-aged women with established unilateral disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This Chingford population again consisted of predominantly Caucasian, middle class females, and, as in the previous study, patients with unilateral knee OA of grade 2 or above by the Kellgren and Lawrence scale were included. Of the 67 women with unilateral disease, 20 (34 percent) developed contralateral disease by radiographic criteria at 24 months. Among those with incident OA, only 10 percent of patients with low BMI tertile developed OA versus 25 and 47 percent in the middle and highest tertile, respectively. The relative risk was 4.69 from the lowest to highest obesity tertile. Furthermore, the risk of contralateral OA increased by 6.5 percent for each additional 5 kilograms of weight. Female patients with unilateral OA are, therefore, at high risk of developing contralateral disease, and an enhanced risk is associated with increasing weight.</p><p>In patients at risk for or in early phases of OA, weight loss may decrease the rate of OA development in the knee. A multicenter observational study evaluated the impact of weight loss on OA seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee in 640 adults (mean age, 62.9 years; 398 women) who were overweight or obese or with mild to moderate OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When compared with those without weight loss, patients with a decrease in BMI of at least 5 percent over a 48-month period showed a decrease in rate of progression of knee cartilage and meniscal degeneration; the magnitude of effect was larger for those with a &ge;10 percent decrease in BMI.</p><p>Among older adults, the combination of obesity and heavy physical activity is associated with an enhanced risk of OA of the knee, defined radiologically. Using data from the Framingham heart study (the Framingham Osteoarthritis Study), older individuals (average age of 70 years) in the upper tertile of BMI who performed at least three hours per day of significant physical activity had an OR of 13 of developing knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Lesser degrees of activity were not associated with an enhanced risk. In another, younger cohort of Framingham residents (mean age 53 years) followed for nine years, the incidence of symptomatic or radiographic OA of the knee was not significantly different in those with lower versus higher levels of self-reported physical activity regardless of initial weight or BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of symptomatic OA of the knee among patients with radiographic OA in the Framingham Osteoarthritis Study cohort increased over the 20 years between 1983 to 1985 and 2002 to 2005, after adjustment for both age and BMI (from 26 to 49 percent in women and from 19 to 49 percent in men) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Knee pain and obesity also increased in the same interval in this cohort and in national survey data in the United States. However, increased obesity only explained a portion of the change (about 10 to 25 percent), and, notably, radiographic knee OA did not increase during this interval. The precise factors responsible for these increases in symptom prevalence and an increased rate of knee joint replacement surgery during this period are uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hand</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Utilizing data from the Tecumseh Community Health Study, one study prospectively evaluated the risks for developing OA of the hand. Patients with preexisting OA or rheumatoid arthritis were excluded. A weight index was calculated utilizing sex-specific desired weight to height ratios from Metropolitan Life actuarial tables; obesity was defined as an index of greater than 120 percent. Over the 23 year period, there was a 41 percent incidence of hand OA as defined by radiographic criteria in the Atlas of Standard Radiographs of Arthritis. Obesity was associated with a relative risk of 3.12 for the development of hand OA. This enhanced rate occurred in obese patients without preexisting disease, thereby supporting the hypothesis that obesity is causal in OA. The findings of this study support the postulate that decreased exercise resulting from joint pain is not the only reason why obesity is associated with OA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Hip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although obesity may cause OA of the knees and hands, less consistent data support a relationship between hip OA and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/4,7,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,15-17</a>]. One study of Finnish patients age 30 and over selected from a population registry found hip OA (as defined by clinical and radiographic criteria) in 6 and 4 percent of women and men, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence of arthritis increased with increased BMI, with an enhanced OR of 2.8 for bilateral hip disease from the lowest and highest weight groups. However, this report was flawed in part because of a cross-sectional design. Nevertheless, in an all-women study, a significant correlation with obesity was seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A significant association between BMI and total hip arthroplasty for OA was also noted in a cohort of over one million Norwegian men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>By comparison, another study of over 1000 male medical students found that increased body mass index measured at ages 20 to 39 years enhanced the risk of developing knee, but not hip, OA at follow-up at 36 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of OA associated with obesity may be modifiable. As an example, one report of 64 patients with OA of recent onset from the Framingham knee OA study found a correlation between weight change and OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most cases of OA occurred in women who had gained at least four units of BMI or in those with gains of between two and four BMI units. The lowest rate of incident disease occurred in women who lost two to four BMI units. By examining the rate over time, any increase in BMI was correlated with a nonsignificant trend toward higher risk for symptomatic OA, and a loss in BMI was significantly correlated with a decreased risk. Unfortunately, the findings of the study are weakened by its reliance upon the recall of the date of symptom onset.</p><p>Since obesity is the most modifiable risk factor associated with the development of OA, clinicians should counsel their patients that weight loss will decrease their risk. It is likely that even modest weight loss will provide some benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated disability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OA due to obesity is also associated with significant morbidity. One study, for example, examined the relationships between obesity, OA, and disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Using a patient population in a rural southeastern section of the United States that included a significant proportion of African Americans, the study sought independent risk factors for disability from OA. Variables included age, race, sex, level of education, marital status, knee pain on most days, severity of knee pain, the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), BMI, and knee radiographs. Only age (particularly age greater than 75), female sex, obesity, and knee pain severity had independent impacts on mean HAQ scores. Specifically, obesity was significantly associated with a worse HAQ score and more severe knee pain. This study is important in both its examination of the functional status of its cohort and its inclusion of a significant number of African-American patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">LACK OF OSTEOPOROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher bone mass is associated with an increased risk of hip osteoarthritis (OA) in older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. As an example, the radiographs of 4855 women aged 65 and older were examined for radiographic evidence of OA and compared with measurements of bone mineral density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Women with moderate to severe evidence of OA had higher bone mineral density measurements than those without OA. This inverse association between osteoporosis and OA was supported by a large cross-sectional study that controlled for the effects of estrogen replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>A similar relation exists between bone mineral density and the prevalence of OA of the knee. In the Framingham study population, the prevalence of radiographic OA was 17 percent in 115 women in the lowest quartile of bone mineral density and increased steadily to 34 percent for those in the highest quartile of bone density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Despite the positive association between bone density and radiographic prevalence of OA, the same study found that women who were more osteopenic were more likely to have progressive worsening of their OA, at least radiographically, than those with higher bone density.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Estrogen replacement therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevention of bone loss via estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) should, therefore, enhance the development of OA. Support for this hypothesis is provided by the results of some animal models of OA in which the administration of estrogen promoted cartilage damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. This result, however, was not found in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Some clinical studies suggest that postmenopausal ERT protects women from developing large joint OA (thereby resulting in a lower than expected risk of knee and hip OA), while others show only a neutral effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Of these studies, four evaluated the effect of ERT on prevalent disease, and one studied the effect on incident and progressive radiographic disease. A meta-analysis of the four prevalence studies suggested an inverse relationship. This association was supported by another study which reported a strong inverse relationship between ERT and OA among women receiving long-term ERT for both prevalent radiographic OA and incident OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>However, one case-control study failed to confirm the finding that ERT protects women from developing OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Although there was a modest but nonsignificant inverse association between past use and the development of OA, ongoing use was not associated with OA risk. Likewise, in a four-year prospective study of ERT in women (HERS trial) that randomly assigned subjects to <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin</span> or placebo, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of knee pain or in the degree of disability between those on ERT or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>As the evidence from studies is conflicting, there may be many potential co-variables that may not have been adequately controlled. Although a randomized, prospective clinical trial might help to clarify the effect of ERT on the development of OA, such a trial seems unlikely to be performed given concern about the risks of such therapy in postmenopausal women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">OCCUPATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of occupation and osteoarthritis (OA) has been examined in multiple studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/1-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-11</a>], and reports have linked knee OA with specific occupations, including cotton workers, dock workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], shipyard workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and carpenters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hand and hip OA have also all been evaluated and linked to occupations associated with physical labor. Despite these associations, it is unclear whether a change in occupation lessens the risk of OA.</p><p>Mechanisms for the association between occupation and OA remain unclear but may involve joint loading and repetitive damage over time. Since these processes likely differ from joint area to joint area, occupational OA will be examined separately by affected joint area.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Knee</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain occupational activities, especially those related to repetitive knee-bending, appear to be risk factors for the development of knee OA. As an example, a case-control study of patients with symptomatic knee OA attempted to define specific occupational activities that favor the development of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Analysis found increased odds ratios (ORs) with greater than 30 minutes of squatting (OR = 6.9), greater than 30 minutes of kneeling (OR = 3.4), and climbing more than 10 flights of stairs per day (OR = 2.7). These results suggest that prolonged knee-bending was a risk factor for OA via mechanical loading. Similar associations with knee-bending have been found in population-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/10,21,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21,43,44</a>]. The combination of obesity and occupational bent-knee activities leads to an even higher risk of knee OA (OR = 14.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Hip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical stresses associated with certain occupations also appear to be associated with an increased risk of hip OA. One retrospective study examining occupational hip OA evaluated all outpatient urograms over a five-year period in which both hips were visualized in males 60 to 75 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. OA was defined as joint spaces less than 2.5 mm or as the presence of a prosthetic hip replacement. The control group consisted of patients with at least 3.5 mm of joint space in the hip and no other evidence of OA such as cysts, sclerosis, or osteophytes. Patients were interviewed for occupational activity, sports, and hobbies. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although no occupational association with OA was found overall, analysis of severe hip OA (defined as a joint space of less than 1.5 mm) revealed an increased OR for working at least one year as a farmer (OR = 1.6) or as a construction <span class=\"nowrap\">worker/laborer</span> (OR = 1.5).

These associations are strongest for OA of the knee and hand and are less strong for that of the hip. Rarely, inherited conditions may predispose individuals to develop OA. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors and possible causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age and gender are important risk factors for OA. Advanced age is one of the strongest risk factors, and numerous studies have found that female sex is associated with an increased relative risk of OA (estimated 2.6) after adjustment for age, weight, and smoking. Studies in women have also found that higher bone mass is associated with an increased risk of hip OA and have shown an inverse relationship between receipt of long-term postmenopausal hormone therapy and OA. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Age'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Female sex'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Lack of osteoporosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen replacement therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity may be the strongest modifiable risk factor for OA, but the risk varies by joint. The association is strongest for the knees and hands but is less consistent for the hip. It is likely that even modest weight loss will provide some benefit in modifying risk. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Knee'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hand'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hip'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Risk reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical activities related to both occupation and sports affect the risk of OA, as do previous injuries and muscle strength. Mechanisms for the association between specific occupations and OA of the knees, hands, or hips may involve joint loading and repetitive damage over time. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Occupation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Sports activities'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Previous injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Muscle weakness'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Muscle strength'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Summary of risk associated with physical exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Taken together, the studies on physical activity indicate that:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neuroanatomically normal joints are at increased risk of developing OA in the absence of adequate exercise.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neuroanatomically normal joints are <strong>not</strong> at increased risk upon exposure to repetitive, low-impact, recreational exercise.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neuroanatomically abnormal joints are at increased risk upon exposure to repetitive, low impact, recreational exercise.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neuroanatomically normal joints are at increased risk upon exposure to repetitive, high-impact exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic factors have been implicated in the development of OA, based upon conventional twin and non-twin sibling, population, and modern molecular studies. Such factors may have more influence on the expression of some subsets of OA than others. As examples, primary generalized &quot;nodal&quot; OA, characterized by Heberden's nodes, Bouchard's nodes, and involvement of the hips and knees, appears to have a genetic component; and genetic abnormalities in collagen or alterations in cartilage or bone metabolism may also predispose to OA.
