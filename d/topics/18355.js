Bacteria (germs) do not normally live in these areas. When bacteria enter the bladder or kidneys, an infection can develop. These infections are called urinary tract infections (UTIs).</p><p>Kidney infections are the most serious type of UTI because, if not treated quickly, the infection can permanently damage the kidneys. Rarely, damage to the kidney can lead to high blood pressure and kidney failure later in life.</p><p>UTIs in adolescents and adults are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Urinary tract infections in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>).

These bacteria can move from the anus to the urethra and into the bladder (and sometimes up into the kidney), causing infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some children have a higher chance of developing a UTI. The following are some risk factors for UTI:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young age &ndash; Boys younger than one year old and girls younger than four years of age are at highest risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being uncircumcised &ndash; There is a four to 10 times higher risk of UTIs in uncircumcised boys. Still, most uncircumcised boys do <strong>not</strong> develop UTIs.

Waiting to start treatment can increase the risk of damage to the kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A urine sample is needed to determine if the child has a UTI. In young children who are not toilet trained, initial testing may be performed on a urine sample collected in a bag. However, if those results suggest that the child has a UTI, it is usually necessary to insert a thin sterile tube (a catheter) into the bladder to obtain a urine sample for the urine culture. The use of bags to collect urine for urine culture is discouraged because the results are often misleading.</p><p>In older children who can use the toilet, you can collect a urine sample by having the child urinate into a sterile cup.</p><p>After obtaining the urine, a urine dipstick test is usually done in the office. If the test suggests a UTI or the child has UTI symptoms, the doctor or nurse will send the urine sample to a lab for urine culture to confirm the diagnosis. The culture helps decide which antibiotic is best. It takes up to 48 hours for germs to grow, so the culture results are not available right away.</p><p>Based on the child's symptoms and the results of the dipstick test, the doctor or nurse may decide to start antibiotics before urine culture results are available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging tests, such as ultrasound, can show if a child's urinary system did not form correctly before birth. If the urinary system is abnormal, a child is more likely to have UTIs. A kidney ultrasound is generally done in younger children (less than three to five years old). Children who have had more than one UTI generally have more detailed imaging tests (a voiding cystourethrogram [VCUG] test) to look for abnormalities that may have been missed by the ultrasound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Kidney ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the kidneys. During the test, gel is applied to the skin on the child's back and abdomen, and a small wand-like device is pressed against the body. The test is not painful and usually takes less than 30 minutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Voiding cystourethrogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A VCUG is an x-ray test that shows the outline of the child's bladder and urethra. The test can also show if urine flows from the bladder backwards into the ureters or kidneys; this is called vesicoureteral reflux. Reflux may increase the chance that a child will have kidney infections.</p><p>This test takes approximately one to two hours to complete and involves putting a catheter into the child's bladder. Dye is put into the child's bladder through the catheter, and x-rays are taken before and after the child urinates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">URINARY TRACT INFECTION TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics are used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs). The best antibiotic depends upon the child's age, the germ that caused the UTI, and the resistance that germs have. Most children who are older than two months are given an antibiotic by mouth, in a liquid or chewable tablet.</p><p>If the child is less than two months old, or if the child is vomiting and unable to take medicine by mouth, it may be necessary for the child to be admitted to the hospital for treatment with intravenous (IV) antibiotics.</p><p>Antibiotics are usually prescribed for a total of 5 to 10 days. In all cases, it is important for the child to take each dose of the antibiotic on time and to finish all of the medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Response to treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child should begin to feel better within 24 to 48 hours of starting antibiotics. If your child does not get better or worsens, he or she should be seen again by a doctor or nurse. Most children who have a UTI have no long-term damage to the urinary tract from the infection. It is not necessary to have another urine test after a child has finished antibiotic treatment, as long as the UTI symptoms have resolved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">URINARY TRACT INFECTION PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 8 to 30 percent (1 in 5 to 10) of children who have a urinary tract infection (UTI) develop another UTI. This usually happens within the first six months after the first infection and is more common in girls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-long-term-management-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections in children: Long-term management and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of constipation and bladder problems will also help prevent future UTIs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventive antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A low daily dose of an antibiotic may be recommended if your child gets frequent UTIs. This treatment is usually continued for 6 to 12 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child has any of the following, make an appointment with his or her doctor or nurse:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; Fever (temperature higher than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C) may be the only symptom of urinary tract infection in infants and young children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or burning with urination or frequent urination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back or abdominal pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your child's medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=1171\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
