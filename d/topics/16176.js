Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce blood glucose by increasing urinary glucose excretion.</p><p>This topic will review the mechanism of action and therapeutic utility of SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A general discussion of the initial management of blood glucose and the management of persistent hyperglycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4291761945\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SGLT2 is expressed in the proximal tubule and mediates reabsorption of approximately 90 percent of the filtered glucose load. SGLT2 inhibitors promote the renal excretion of glucose and thereby modestly lower elevated blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. The ability to lower blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels is limited by the filtered load of glucose and the osmotic diuresis that is caused by this therapy. Moreover, although the currently developed SGLT2 inhibitors almost completely block proximal tubular glucose reabsorption, the measured inhibition is less than 50 percent based on urine glucose excretion.</p><p>The glucose-lowering effect is independent of insulin (beta cell function and insulin sensitivity). Thus, they do not usually cause hypoglycemia in the absence of therapies that otherwise cause hypoglycemia. SGLT2 inhibitors decrease blood pressure and weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sodium-glucose-co-transporter-2-inhibitors-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3818284521\"><span class=\"h1\">GLYCEMIC EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SGLT2 inhibitors are relatively weak glucose-lowering agents, with mean reductions in A1C compared with placebo ranging between 0.4 to 1.1 percent depending on baseline level of hyperglycemia.

Compared with patients taking placebo, patients taking empagliflozin had lower A1C levels (mean 7.8 versus 8.2 percent) and reductions in weight, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (with no increase in heart rate), and uric acid.

Moreover, the benefit in patients taking canagliflozin, in particular, must be balanced with the increased risk of amputations. The difference in glycemia between the treatment groups was minimal, suggesting that extra-glycemic effects of the drugs were responsible for the CVD outcome. It is unknown whether empagliflozin, canagliflozin, or other SGLT2 inhibitors, will have similar CVD effects in the majority of persons with type 2 diabetes who do not have overt CVD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2268566484\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROVASCULAR OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few trials evaluating microvascular outcomes in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=empagliflozin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Empagliflozin</a> &ndash; In the empagliflozin trial described above, which was designed specifically to evaluate cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and established CVD, microvascular disease was a prespecified secondary outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sodium-glucose-co-transporter-2-inhibitors-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The relatively brief duration of the study and modest lowering of glycemia (relative A1C reduction of 0.2 to 0.6 percent compared with placebo over time) make glucose lowering an unlikely explanation for the reductions in relatively late-stage nephropathy.

SGLT2 inhibitors promote the renal excretion of glucose and thereby modestly lower elevated blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes. They do not usually cause hypoglycemia in the absence of therapies that otherwise cause hypoglycemia. SGLT2 inhibitors decrease blood pressure and weight. (See <a href=\"#H4291761945\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3818284521\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2325150020\" class=\"local\">'Weight loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SGLT2 inhibitors are not considered as initial therapy for the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H433635592\" class=\"local\">'Candidates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus includes education, with emphasis on lifestyle changes including diet, exercise, and weight reduction when appropriate. In the absence of contraindications, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> is usually the initial pharmacologic therapy for most patients with type 2 diabetes. Initial management is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The therapeutic options for patients who fail initial therapy with lifestyle intervention and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> are to add a second oral or injectable agent, including insulin, or to switch to insulin. The choice of therapy should be individualized based upon patient characteristics, preferences, and costs. Options include thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and insulin. All of these medications have advantages and disadvantages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56876 \">table 1</a>). The expense, side effects, and limited data on long-term safety make us cautious about suggesting the use of agents other than insulin.

(See <a href=\"#H3125494270\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">SGLT2 inhibitors in general may have a role as a third agent in those who cannot or will not take insulin, when full doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> and a sulfonylurea have not produced satisfactory metabolic control, or in patients in whom risk of hypoglycemia is high (frail, older adults) or in whom avoidance of weight gain is a priority. However, long-term safety has not been established. (See <a href=\"#H433635592\" class=\"local\">'Candidates'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H7554297\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Dual agent failure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a decision has been made to use an SGLT2 inhibitor in a patient with type 2 diabetes and CVD, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=empagliflozin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">empagliflozin</a>, rather than another SGLT2 inhibitor (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This is based on the results of the empagliflozin and cardiovascular outcomes study. In patients without CVD, choice of SGLT2 inhibitor is often dictated by cost and insurer formulary preference. (See <a href=\"#H4181290805\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3125494270\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume status and renal function (serum creatinine with estimation of glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) should be assessed prior to starting an SGLT2 inhibitor and periodically thereafter.
