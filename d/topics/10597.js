You can eat moist foods, or suck on ice chips or sugar-free hard candy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If you have mouth sores, eat soft foods that you can chew and swallow easily. You can also cut up your food into small pieces or mash it in a blender. Try to avoid spicy or salty foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If you have nausea, eat foods that are bland and dry, such as crackers, rice, and toast. Avoid foods that are spicy and greasy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If you have trouble having a bowel movement, try to drink more fluids. You can also eat foods with a lot of fiber, such as vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, oatmeal, and some breads and cereals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79063\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79063 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If you have diarrhea, try to drink a lot of fluids so your body doesn't lose too much water. Try to avoid milk, greasy foods, and foods with a lot of fiber.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14856222\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are not able to keep any food or drink in your stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are dizzy or weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14856229\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there medicines that can increase my appetite?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can prescribe different medicines to help increase a person's appetite. Medicines that doctors commonly use include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormone medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroids &ndash; Doctors usually recommend that people not take these medicines for more than a few weeks. Even though these medicines can help, they can also cause problems of their own.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14856236\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there other treatments that can help if I have no appetite or lose weight?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Sometimes, doctors use other treatments if people are unable to eat or if their body doesn't take in nutrients from the food they do eat.</p><p>People who can't eat on their own but whose bodies can digest food might get &quot;tube feedings.&quot; People who get tube feedings get their food and nutrients through a tube that goes into the stomach or small intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55616 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>People whose bodies are unable to digest food might get their nutrition through a thin tube that goes into the vein. But doctors don't usually need to use this type of treatment for patients who have cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14856243\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
