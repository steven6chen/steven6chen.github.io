There are 2 main types of dry powder inhalers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67084\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67084 \">picture 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single-dose inhalers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple-dose inhalers</p><p/><p>The directions for the 2 types of inhalers are slightly different.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11860592\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I use my child's dry powder inhaler?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each dry powder inhaler has its own directions. Your doctor or nurse will show you how to use your child's inhaler.</p><p>In general, these are the steps for using a dry powder inhaler:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open the inhaler or take off the cover</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Load a dose of medicine:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For single-dose inhalers, you load a dose by taking a pill out of its packaging and putting the pill into the inhaler. Then you need to push 1 or more buttons on the inhaler to poke holes in the pill.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For multiple-dose inhalers, you load a dose by sliding a lever or twisting the bottom (or another part) of the inhaler.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hold the inhaler in the correct position &ndash; Some inhalers need to be held upright, but others need to be horizontal. Multiple-dose inhalers usually need to be horizontal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child breathe out normally &ndash; but <strong>not</strong> into the inhaler</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child put his or her mouth on the mouthpiece</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child breathe in quickly and steadily, as deeply as possible</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child remove his or her mouth from the mouthpiece and hold his or her breath for 5 to 10 seconds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child let his or her breath out &ndash; but <strong>not</strong> into the inhaler</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For single-dose inhalers, you need to open the inhaler, take out the used pill, and throw it away</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If your child is supposed to take 2 puffs of the inhaler, load another dose and have him or her repeat the steps above</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close the inhaler or replace the cover or cap</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child rinse out his or her mouth, and spit out the water</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Store the inhaler in a cool, dry place</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11860599\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to clean my child's inhaler?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Do <strong>not</strong> wash a dry powder inhaler with water or put it under water. If the mouthpiece gets dirty, you can wipe it with a dry cloth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11860606\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know when my child's inhaler is empty?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many dry powder inhalers come with a built-in dose counter. A counter keeps track of how many doses are left in the inhaler.</p><p>When the counter reads 0 (zero), it's time to throw out the inhaler. That's because there is no more medicine in it. Make sure to have another inhaler on hand before the counter reads 0.</p><p>If the inhaler doesn't have a built-in counter, you need to keep track of the number of doses left in the inhaler. Based on how often your child uses the inhaler, you can figure out when he or she will need a refill and write this date down.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11860613\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-childs-metered-dose-inhaler-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your child's metered dose inhaler (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
