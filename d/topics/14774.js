RT has been utilized as adjuvant therapy after complete excision of a primary melanoma or after therapeutic lymphadenectomy to reduce the rate of local or nodal recurrence for certain types of melanoma. </p><p>Based upon important developments in targeted therapy and immunotherapy, systemic therapy is the preferred option in most clinical settings of stage IV disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 \">table 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664 \">table 1B</a>), with RT use reserved for palliation, such as for painful bony metastasis, spinal cord compression, brain metastasis, or soft tissue metastasis causing pain, bleeding, or obstruction. Increasingly, RT is used as consolidation therapy for residual disease in patients not achieving a major response to systemic treatment. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) can be particularly effective in ablating oligometastatic disease. Multidisciplinary consultation involving a surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist is required to assure optimal patient care. </p><p>The role of RT in the management of patients with melanoma is reviewed here. Discussions of the integration of RT in the treatment of melanoma brain metastases and the role of specialized RT techniques in the treatment of uveal melanoma are presented separately, as is the role of systemic therapy in the management of advanced melanoma. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of brain metastases in melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-uveal-and-conjunctival-melanomas#H3502222097\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of uveal and conjunctival melanomas&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of advanced cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8198900\"><span class=\"h1\">DOSE AND SCHEDULE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The notion that melanoma is intrinsically radioresistant initially arose from cell culture studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>] that showed a broad shoulder in the cell survival curves, implying better response to a higher dose per fraction and an unusually high repair capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Some early clinical observations using large fractions of radiation per fraction supported these laboratory findings. However, other studies did not observe a difference between various large-fraction schedules, and some single-institution series reported similar outcomes with conventional fractionation schedules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>These conflicting observations led to a multicenter randomized phase III trial, which failed to show better outcomes with large fraction sizes. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial randomly assigned 137 patients with metastatic melanoma at any site other than the abdomen or brain to four fractions of 8 Gy administered at weekly intervals or 20 fractions of 2.5 Gy administered daily five days per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There was no difference in the clinical response rate (24 and 23 percent, respectively, for complete response and 36 versus 34 percent for partial response); the durations of tumor control and survival were not reported. There were three grade 4 toxicities and three grade 3 toxicities in the four fractions of 8 Gy arm compared with only four grade 3 toxicities in the 20 fractions of 2.5 Gy arm. Toxicity data from this trial are difficult to interpret due to the short follow-up, limited number of events, and nonstandard treatment schedules used in both arms of this study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8198913\"><span class=\"h1\">CUTANEOUS PRIMARY LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wide resection is the definitive treatment of localized cutaneous melanoma. In rare cases (eg, inoperability because of medical comorbidities or proximity to vital structures such as the eye), definitive RT may be considered to the primary site.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11482335\"><span class=\"h2\">Lentigo maligna</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lentigo maligna, historically known as Hutchinson melanotic freckle, is a subtype of melanoma in situ characterized by atypical intraepidermal melanocytes. It has a slow growth rate and low potential to develop into invasive disease. In most instances, surgical resection remains the preferred approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lentigo-maligna-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H244299056\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lentigo maligna: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>However, these lesions have been treated successfully with RT, which is an alternative when surgery is not feasible. The typical dose is 50 to 54 Gy in 2 Gy fractions with superficial energy radiation treating to a depth of 5 mm. A hypofractionated schedule can also be used depending on the size and location of the disease and the comorbidity of the patients.</p><p>In a large series, 593 patients with lentigo maligna and early lentigo maligna melanoma were treated with superficial energy RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The study assessed outcomes for primary treatment with RT, partial surgical removal followed by RT alone, and wide excision followed by postoperative RT, with reported complete clearance rates of 83, 90, and 97 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11482341\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For invasive melanomas, RT has only a very limited role as the initial therapy, although it may retain utility as adjuvant therapy in carefully selected cases.</p><p>There are limited data regarding the effectiveness of RT as primary therapy for more deeply invasive nodular melanomas. In one series of 95 cases, high radiation doses (100 to 110 Gy) were delivered in 6 Gy fractions using superficial 60 kVp X-rays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The five-year survival rate was 68 percent, a value similar to that obtained with wide local excision, but these observations have not been confirmed in a randomized trial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;</a>.) </p><p>However, in certain circumstances, the rate of local recurrence at the primary site is unacceptably high after surgery alone, and adjuvant RT may be considered to improve local control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Key risk factors for local recurrence are thick tumors (Breslow &gt;4 mm), ulceration, and the presence of satellitosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angiolymphatic and perineural invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In some cases, anatomic constraints may limit the ability to obtain wide negative surgical margins, particularly in the head and neck. RT has also been effectively used in the setting of either positive or close margins where further excision was not considered feasible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199065\"><span class=\"h2\">Desmoplastic melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desmoplastic melanoma is a rare subtype that accounts for approximately 1 to 4 percent of all melanomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathologic characteristics of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Desmoplastic melanoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;, section on 'Desmoplastic melanoma'</a>.) </p><p>Desmoplastic melanoma is frequently associated with perineural spread (neurotropism) and has been associated with an increased local failure rate. </p><p>There are no randomized trials defining the role of adjuvant RT after complete resection of desmoplastic melanoma with or without neurotropism. However, multiple case series support the use of adjuvant RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. This is illustrated by the two largest series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest series, from the Melanoma Institute Australia, compared the outcomes of 671 neurotropic melanomas (72 percent of which were desmoplastic melanoma) with those of a control cohort of 718 non-neurotropic&nbsp;melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Eighty-two patients were given adjuvant RT to the primary site. At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, adjuvant RT halved the risk of local recurrence if the pathological margins were less than 8 mm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48, 95% CI 0.27-0.87). In multivariable analysis, RT was associated with a significant reduction in the overall risk of recurrence (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29-0.87), particularly at the primary site (HR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13-0.69) and probably the regional nodal site (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.17-0.98) but not at distant sites (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.29-1.24,&nbsp;p = 0.17).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of 277 patients with desmoplastic melanoma, 113 received adjuvant RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At a median follow-up of 43 months, the overall five-year local control rate for patients who received RT was significantly improved compared with that for those not receiving RT (86 versus 46 percent, HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06-0.39). In multivariable analysis, RT was an independent predictor of local control (HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06-0.39). For those with positive resection margins, the local recurrence rate was 14 versus 54 percent in those who did not receive adjuvant RT. For those with negative margins, local control was also improved with adjuvant RT (95 versus 76 percent).</p><p/><p>Based upon these retrospective data showing improvement in local control, adjuvant RT should be considered for neurotropic melanoma that has not been widely resected (pathological margin &lt;8 mm) and for desmoplastic lesions thicker than 4 mm. In addition, RT should be considered for recurrent disease after further surgical resection. More recent data have shown the effectiveness of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy in desmoplastic melanoma, with a response rate of 70 percent and a complete response rate of 32 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients with locally advanced primary desmoplastic melanoma may therefore be considered for anti-PD-1 therapy upfront, and local treatment with surgery or RT may be reserved for residual disease. Such patients should be managed in a multidisciplinary team setting.

Mucosal melanomas are most common in the head and neck, followed by those in anorectal and genitourinary (including vulvovaginal) sites. Surgery is the first choice of therapy for mucosal melanomas. If resection cannot be accomplished, RT may be used to achieve local control in addition to adjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mucosal-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mucosal melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For unresectable disease, primary RT has been used to treat sinonasal melanomas. The Northern Japan Radiation Therapy Oncology Group&nbsp;reported a series of 31 patients treated with definitive RT to a median dose of 50 Gy for unresectable primary mucosal melanoma in the head and neck region. The complete and partial response rates were 29 and 58 percent. Another series of 28 patients showed an actuarial local control rate of 49 percent at three years using a schedule of 50 to 55 Gy in 15 to 16 fractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. With the advances in systemic therapy, there may be a role for upfront systemic therapy and concurrent systemic therapy in addition to RT. These cases should be discussed in a multidisciplinary team meeting and enrolled in a clinical trial if available.</p><p>In the postoperative setting, adjuvant RT decreases the likelihood of local recurrence after complete resection but does not impact survival, in part because of the high rate of systemic relapse in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an example, mucosal head and neck melanomas are associated with a high rate of local disease recurrence, even if the primary lesion is small and the regional nodes are not involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. In a large retrospective series of patients with head and neck mucosal melanomas from the Groupe d'Etude des Tumeurs de la T&ecirc;te et du Cou (GETTEC) group, postoperative RT improved local control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The role of RT in the management of mucosal melanoma is discussed separately.

It is rarely indicated as the definitive management of melanoma metastatic to regional lymph nodes, as surgical excision provides superior local control as well as important prognostic information. RT can also often be used to treat the regional lymph node basin in stage IV disease for palliation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199504\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuvant RT after lymph node dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients at high risk of regional recurrence after lymph node dissection, adjuvant RT following surgery significantly decreases the rate of nodal field relapse, without an improvement in overall survival. Nodal relapses may be difficult to salvage as they can cause significant bleeding, pain, and local lymphatic obstruction, causing edema or plexopathy. Thus, despite the lack of an overall survival benefit, adjuvant RT to the draining lymph node beds has an important role in carefully selected patients to prevent such complications.</p><p>The only randomized data come from a phase III trial of 250 patients that was conducted primarily in Australia and New Zealand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Patients with palpable stage III melanoma were randomly assigned to RT (48 Gy in 20 fractions) or observation after therapeutic nodal dissection. Patients were considered at high risk if there was extranodal spread of melanoma, multiple nodes involved (any parotid involvement, &ge;2 nodes in the neck or axilla, &ge;3 nodes in the groin), or large nodes with disease (&ge;3 cm in the neck, &ge;4 cm in the axilla or groin).</p><p>At a median follow-up of six years, there were significantly fewer relapses in the adjuvant RT group (21 versus 36 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.52, 95% CI 0.31-0.88). However, there was no significant difference in either relapse-free survival (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.65-1.22, p = 0.21) or overall survival (HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.89-1.79, p = 0.51). In multivariable analysis, treatment arm (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.85) and extracapsular extension (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.21-2.36) were independent predictors of nodal field relapse. This trial also examined toxicity and quality of life as secondary endpoints. Twenty percent of the RT patients had a grade 3 toxic effect, mainly affecting skin and subcutaneous tissues. Grade 4 toxicity after RT was uncommon (two patients). Over five years, there were no significant differences in upper limb volume between the two groups. In the lower limbs, there was a significant increase in volume after adjuvant RT compared with observation (mean volume ratio 15.0 versus 7.7 percent, 95% CI 1.5-13.1). In terms of quality of life, there were no significant differences between the two groups at the 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, and 60-month time points except for in physical wellbeing at three months and the Response to Stress Questionnaire total score at 3, 6, and 12 months, all favoring the observation group.</p><p>Based upon these results, patients with the following risk factors could be considered for adjuvant RT for improvement in nodal field control after therapeutic nodal dissection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple positive nodes (any parotid disease, &ge;2 nodes in the neck or axilla, &ge;3 nodes in the groin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extranodal spread</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large involved nodes (&ge;3 cm in the neck, &ge;4 cm in the axilla or groin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive margins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent disease after previous surgery</p><p/><p>The impact of now effective and tolerable adjuvant systemic therapy for patients with stage III melanoma on the threshold for choosing and timing adjuvant RT remains to be determined. Adjuvant RT improves nodal field control in high-risk disease with no overall survival benefit, and this should be balanced against the side effects, especially in the groin region. As a consequence, recommendations for adjuvant RT versus other adjuvant therapy options should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting.

Patients with desmoplastic melanoma and those who had undergone surgery for suspicion of lymph node metastasis were excluded. The 10-year locoregional control rate was 86 percent.

They can be problematic, causing pain, bleeding, or compression of surrounding normal structures. In the absence of extensive distant metastases, surgical excision is the primary approach for in transit metastases when feasible; regional chemotherapy (isolated limb perfusion or isolated limb infusion), systemic therapy (checkpoint inhibitors, BRAF targeted therapy), intralesional therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=talimogene-laherparepvec-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talimogene laherparepvec</a>), and RT are alternatives when surgery is not possible.

However, patients who received a single fraction of RT were 2.6 times more likely to require retreatment with RT than those treated with multiple fractions of RT. Therefore, as a result, RT regimens commonly used for non-melanoma metastases (8 Gy in one fraction to 30 Gy in 10 to 12 fractions) are reasonable. For skeletal metastases associated with a large soft tissue component, a high total dose should be considered, taking into account the patient performance status and burden of disease.

At least one report suggests that large doses per fraction may be beneficial for patients with metastases to the lung, liver, abdominal and pelvic structures, and mediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The likelihood of response was much higher in patients who received fractional doses above 4 Gy compared with lower doses (82 versus 44 percent). The choice of large fractions in patients with visceral metastases must be individualized to the clinical situation and the structures to be irradiated. The use of a large dose per fraction to treat these anatomic sites may be particularly appropriate in the setting of tumor-related hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3236493564\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain metastases are a frequent complication in patients with advanced melanoma and are an important cause of both morbidity and mortality. The approach to patients with melanoma brain metastases is rapidly evolving. Advances in neurosurgical techniques and RT, especially stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), have led to major improvement in the ability to control brain metastases, and systemic therapy (immunotherapy, targeted therapy) has dramatically prolonged overall survival in patients with stage IV disease. </p><p>The prolonged survival and durable remissions in some patients with metastatic melanoma raise important issues concerning complications of therapy, which need to be considered in planning a therapeutic approach. Because of this, a multidisciplinary approach that considers all available treatment modalities is essential for the proper treatment of the patient with brain metastases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-brain-metastases-in-melanoma#H671137645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of brain metastases in melanoma&quot;, section on 'Approach to management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201703\"><span class=\"h1\">STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY AND STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIATION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) delivers a very high dose of radiation to a stereotactically defined target in a single treatment session while sparing the adjacent normal tissue. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) can deliver hypofractionated (high dose per fraction) treatment with high degrees of precision in 3 to 10 treatment sessions over one to three weeks with minimum exposure to the surrounding normal tissues. Rigorous and reproducible patient immobilization is required, and <span class=\"nowrap\">organ/target</span> motions induced by respiration must be minimized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H654912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic radiation therapy techniques'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H201772\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracranial oligometastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SBRT is a promising approach for patients with extracranial oligometastatic disease. </p><p>For example, the precision of stereotactic techniques allows the spinal cord to be spared while delivering a large radiation dose to involved vertebrae or paraspinal tumors, and these approaches may provide important symptom palliation. Several institutions have published their experiences with SRS for spinal lesions in the primary and retreatment settings. A prospective cohort of 393 patients with 500 histologically verified spinal metastases, including 38 melanoma lesions (8 percent), was treated with a dose of 12.5 to 25 Gy in a single fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Significant pain palliation was reported in 86 percent of the patients, and tumor control was achieved in 90 percent of the patients; melanoma bone metastases responded as well as other histologies. Another study analyzed 36 patients with melanoma spinal metastases treated with single-fraction SRS and reported that 96 percent of patients reported improvement of axial and radicular pain and none experienced radiation-induced toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-in-the-management-of-melanoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. For those who previously received conventional external beam RT to the vertebrae, SRS may also play a role in salvage retreatment.

Studies in patients with metastatic disease have included patients with a variety of histologies, including melanoma; these reports indicate a high degree of local control, making this a potentially valuable option for patients with oligometastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-body-radiation-therapy-for-lung-tumors#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung tumors&quot;, section on 'Lung metastases'</a>.)</p><p>Given the improved effectiveness of systemic treatments for patients with advanced melanoma, the role of palliative RT to oligo- or symptomatic metastatic disease requires reassessment.
