Reduction of anticoagulant proteins such as antithrombin, protein S, and protein C may be responsible. The best understood associations include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asparaginase</strong> &ndash; Asparaginase depletes the amino acid asparagine, resulting in a global interference with protein synthesis. Plasma levels of several procoagulant and anticoagulant factors are reduced, and these reductions are thought to be at least partially responsible for the increased risks of bleeding and thrombosis, respectively. Affected factors include prothrombin; factors V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI; fibrinogen; antithrombin; protein C; protein S; von Willebrand factor (VWF); and plasminogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombosis-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The increased risk of thrombosis is thought to be due to reduced levels of antithrombin, protein C, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protein S. The predilection for central nervous system thrombosis in children remains unexplained, and the correlation between VTE risk and plasma levels of antithrombin, protein S, or protein C is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombosis-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The increased risk of bleeding may be due to a combination of effects.

In a series of 11 adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who were treated with <em>Erwinia</em> asparaginase, there was significant lowering of antithrombin levels, but vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors II, VII, and X remained within normal ranges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombosis-in-patients-with-malignancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal approach to prevention and management of asparaginase-associated thrombosis is unknown.
