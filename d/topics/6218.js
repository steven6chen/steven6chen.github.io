With the introduction of effective ART, descriptions of patients with body shape abnormalities such as central fat accumulation and peripheral fat loss emerged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The term &quot;HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome&quot; was coined, but it soon became clear that there was not a single syndrome but rather the co-occurrence of phenotypes that varies from person to person. It may be that some individuals will present with pure lipoatrophy, others have fat accumulation which may present in a variety of ways, and a subset of patients have a mixed picture of both morphologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. Thus, it is more valid to consider the individual components separately. These morphologic abnormalities can also be associated with disorders in glucose and lipid metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>Risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lipodystrophy will be discussed here. The management and treatment of these patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The association between lipodystrophy and metabolic abnormalities is also discussed briefly in this topic. Additional detail on the epidemiology and management of dyslipidemia and disordered glucose metabolism in HIV-infected patients is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiovascular risk (including dyslipidemia) in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controversy exists about how frequently the lipodystrophy syndrome occurs, with estimates ranging from 10 percent to more than 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The wide variation in prevalence may be partly related to differences in definitions or methodology (eg, patient report versus objective measurements) as well differences in host factors, including geography, age, genetics, lifestyle factors, and specific antiretroviral use and duration of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The presumption is that the prevalence will be lower with the increased use of newer antiretroviral drugs, but there are few studies looking at prevalence of the syndrome.</p><p>Moreover, lipoatrophy and fat accumulation appear to be different syndromes with different risk factors and differing prevalences. This point was well illustrated in one study of 452 HIV-infected patients who were followed over one year to assess risk factors for progression of morphologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Lipoatrophy was defined as a triceps skin-fold measurement less than the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for sex and age. Fat accumulation was defined as a waist-to-hip ratio of &gt;0.95 for men and of &gt;0.85 for women as a surrogate for intraabdominal fat. The study demonstrated the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baseline prevalence for lipoatrophy, fat deposition, and a mixed picture was 35, 44, and 14 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of developing new lipoatrophy was increased in patients with low baseline triceps skin-fold values and smaller hips; higher HIV RNA levels and use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> were also predictors of risk. Abacavir is not generally thought to induce lipoatrophy, but this analysis may represent attempts by clinicians to change antiretroviral therapy (ART) to agents thought less likely to contribute to lipoatrophy. (See <a href=\"#H2269730\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, the risk of fat deposition was greater in women and occurred more frequently among those study participants who had higher levels of body fat or higher triglyceride levels at baseline.

The main risk factor for lipoatrophy is exposure to thymidine analogue nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), predominantly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a>, but also <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>. The risk with other agents or classes of antiretroviral therapy (ART), such as protease inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), is less evident in the absence of concurrent thymidine analogue use. HIV disease severity (such as baseline CD4 cell count and viral load) and certain host factors (age, baseline body type) may also influence the risk of lipoatrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2270602\"><span class=\"h3\">Exposure to NRTIs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data suggest that exposure to certain NRTIs is the major factor associated with lipoatrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/5,12,16,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,16,19-23</a>]. Trials comparing different antiviral regimens suggest that thymidine analogs (in particular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a>, but also <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>) play an important role in pathogenesis of lipoatrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/20,21,24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,24-28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an open-label trial in which 237 HIV-infected patients initiating ART were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abacavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abacavir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a>, each combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, a higher proportion of patients taking stavudine developed clinical signs of lipoatrophy (38 versus 5 percent with abacavir) as assessed by anthropometric measurements at 96 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> and tenofovir, each in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, patients randomly assigned to tenofovir demonstrated normal limb fat at 133 weeks of therapy compared with a significant decline in lower limb fat mass in nearly 50 percent of patients receiving stavudine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subset of patients participating in an open-label randomized trial comparing tenofovir-emtricitabine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-and-lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine-lamivudine</a>, each in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, total limb fat at week 48, as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), was less with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> than tenofovir (mean 6.9 versus 8.0 kg fat) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DEXA scans were also performed every 16 weeks on a subset of 157 antiretroviral-na&iuml;ve patients who were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nelfinavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nelfinavir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a>, or both, combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The risk of lipoatrophy with thymidine analogue use may be due to NRTI-induced inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma and mitochondrial toxicity. Surgical biopsy specimens of subcutaneous adipose tissue in patients with lipoatrophy are characterized by mitochondrial DNA depletion, inflammation, and signs of apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Neither <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> nor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> is now considered a first-line NRTI for HIV-infected patients initiating ART. However, some patients who started treatment many years ago may still be on regimens that contain these drugs, and these agents are still used in some resource-limited settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient#H1195766\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;, section on 'Choosing a regimen'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H95344288\"><span class=\"h3\">Exposure to other ART classes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agents from antiretroviral classes other than the NRTIs have been associated with lipoatrophy in some studies, although mainly because of concurrent use with offending NRTIs. Some studies have suggested that although NRTI use contributes to fat wasting, protease inhibitors may act synergistically with NRTIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, therapy with protease inhibitors alone does not appear to lead to lipoatrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similarly, in a metabolic substudy of a trial evaluating various ART regimens (ACTG 5142), the incidence of lipoatrophy was higher with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efavirenz-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efavirenz</a> plus two NRTIs compared with lopinavir plus two NRTIs or efavirenz plus lopinavir, but the association between efavirenz and lipoatrophy was mainly in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, not tenofovir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Other studies have also suggested that the role of efavirenz in the development of lipoatrophy is minimal and mainly directed by the nucleoside analogs that form the backbone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Other studies suggest that integrase inhibitors do not contribute to lipoatrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Risk of limb-fat loss with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilpivirine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilpivirine</a> appears similar to that with efavirenz [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2270284\"><span class=\"h3\">Host and viral factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV disease severity and certain host factors may interact to result in lipoatrophy. Characteristics that have been associated with lipoatrophy, either self-reported or objectively measured, include increased age, lower fat mass at baseline, higher baseline viral loads, and lower CD4 cell counts at initiation of HIV therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/16,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,38,39</a>]. However, not all studies using objective measurements of lipoatrophy have confirmed a link with age or lower CD4 cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>Although fat atrophy is often associated with weight loss, there is no apparent association with nutrition status.</p><p>There has also been an epidemiological association between coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the development of lipoatrophy in HIV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipoatrophy involves the loss of subcutaneous fat in the face, arms, legs, abdomen, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> buttocks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/16,17,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,43</a>]. In contrast to AIDS-associated wasting, lipoatrophy is distinguished by the preferential loss of subcutaneous fat tissue without substantial loss of lean tissue mass in patients who are clinically responding to ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/5,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,44</a>].</p><p>Facial lipoatrophy is characterized by loss of the buccal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> temporal fat pads, leading to facial skeletonization with concave cheeks, prominent nasolabial folds, periorbital hollowing, and visible facial musculature (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77131\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77131 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Atrophy of the buccal fat pads is of particular concern to patients since it gives the appearance of facial wasting and can have an impact on self-esteem; lipoatrophy may also contribute to stigma as it is recognized to be associated with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Lipoatrophy is also readily apparent in the extremities, as veins and musculature become more prominent with the loss of supporting subcutaneous fat. Truncal fat atrophy may be detectable by a minimal amount of subcutaneous &quot;pinchable&quot; fat in the abdomen, but it is often less obvious than lipoatrophy elsewhere, especially if there is fat deposition within the abdominal cavity. In this situation, waist circumference may not change, as the intraabdominal volume may be increasing at the same time as the subcutaneous fat is decreasing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72033\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72033 \">figure 1</a>). This may only be determined by computed tomography (CT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116436\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef116436 \">image 1</a>) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which can distinguish intraabdominal and subcutaneous fat; however, these scans are rarely performed for this purpose as a part of clinical care.</p><p>Studies evaluating body composition following initiation of ART have suggested that limb fat increases during the first few months of treatment and then progressively decreases over the subsequent few years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/12,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,47</a>]. A substantial amount of fat may need to be lost before lipoatrophy is clinically apparent, as this depends on the amount of fat that was present at baseline. In one study of HIV-infected patients who underwent DEXA to quantify fat loss, a limb fat loss of 30 percent was needed for it to be visually evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Fat accumulation coexists with lipoatrophy in a number of patients. In a classic case of fat atrophy and fat accumulation, the abdominal wall of such an individual would have scant pinchable fat but would have a high waist circumference with increased intraabdominal fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/5,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,49</a>]. Dyslipidemia and disordered glucose metabolism are also often seen in patients with HIV-associated lipoatrophy.

The diagnosis of HIV-associated lipoatrophy is made by detection of characteristic findings on visual inspection and physical exam (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above). Patient self-report may be an early and the best indicator of body shape changes. Additionally, it may be possible to diagnose truncal fat atrophy by a minimal amount of pinchable (subcutaneous) fat on the abdomen.</p><p>Anthropometric evaluations of limb circumferences and skin folds provide data regarding body shape but can vary depending on the evaluator. Objective quantification of fat can be obtained by CT, MRI, and DEXA scanning, but these are usually limited to research venues and offer no additional benefit to patient self-report and physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], as they are difficult to interpret and norms are not available.</p><p>Various staging scales have been suggested to characterize the severity of facial atrophy, but many of these are subjective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Intraobserver variability was satisfactory with one scale that incorporated objective anatomic findings (eg, malar depression, buccal extension, nasolabial ridge) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Nevertheless, there are no widely accepted objective techniques for assessing malar atrophy.</p><p>Although HIV-infected patients should be routinely assessed for abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism regardless of lipodystrophy, the presence of lipoatrophy should prompt such evaluation if not already performed.

Furthermore, no particular antiretroviral agent or class has been specifically implicated in the development of fat accumulation. The use of protease inhibitor therapy, specifically, was initially thought to lead to the development of fat accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/43,54,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,54,58</a>]. However, in studies that have replaced protease inhibitor agents with alternative ART (eg, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTIs] or integrase inhibitors), there has been no observed decrease in visceral fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>].

As an example, in a randomized study of 422 antiretroviral-na&iuml;ve patients initiating ART, there was no difference in the development of regional fat in any between any of the three treatment arms, which were a protease inhibitor with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) backbone, a NNRTI with NRTI backbone, or a protease inhibitor plus a NNRTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

Some evidence has suggested that fat deposition in HIV-infected patients may reflect the epidemic of obesity occurring in the general population, rather than an effect of HIV infection or ART. As such, the appearance of lipodystrophy may be obesity with concurrent fat atrophy. One study that compared HIV-infected patients with uninfected controls (Fat Redistribution and Metabolic Abnormalities in HIV or FRAM study) suggested that overall fat deposition was no more common in HIV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/5,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,49</a>]. It also showed that the prevalence of cervical dorsal fat pad (buffalo hump) was similar in HIV-infected and uninfected controls; however, the size of the buffalo hump may be significantly greater in HIV-infected individuals. Another study demonstrated that BMI, as well as waist and hip circumference, increased over five years among 266 HIV-uninfected women but remained stable in 942 HIV-infected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. By contrast, in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, HIV-infected men had more rapid increases in waist circumference over five years than HIV-uninfected men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It should be noted that neither BMI or waist or hip measurements are specific for visceral (intraabdominal) fat.</p><p>There does seem to be an association between fat accumulation and nutrition status. Studies that have examined the diet of HIV-infected individuals with and without visceral adiposity have suggested that poorer quality of diet, as measured by amount of fiber, are associated with the occurrence of fat deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. The increasing frequency of obesity in the HIV-infected population may obscure the ability to detect fat accumulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal fat accumulation is an excess of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) that results in an increase in abdominal girth. &quot;Buffalo hump&quot; results from an accumulation of fat in the dorsocervical area. Fat accumulation can also occur in the trunk and upper chest. Both men and women may develop deposition of extra breast fat or symmetrical deposits of subcutaneous fat nodules on their trunk and extremities (eg, lipomas).</p><p>In many cases, it may be difficult to distinguish this syndrome from simple obesity, in which visceral fat is also accompanied by increased amounts of subcutaneous fat in the abdominal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72033\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72033 \">figure 1</a>). HIV-associated fat accumulation is primarily visceral fat deposition with normal or decreased (but not increased) amounts of subcutaneous fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/5,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,49</a>]. Visceral or intraabdominal fat is not palpable externally; thus, pinchable fat at the waistline is a helpful clinical distinguishing feature of subcutaneous fat. An HIV-infected patient with both lipoatrophy and fat deposition would have minimal pinchable fat at the waistline despite a possibly increased waist circumference. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can distinguish between visceral and subcutaneous fat but are rarely performed for this purpose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F116436\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef116436 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Studies evaluating body composition following initiation of ART have suggested that central fat increases soon after initiation of ART, within the first several months, but may subsequently level off [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/12,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,47</a>].</p><p>In addition to fat accumulation in preexisting fatty tissue, fat deposition can also occur in the muscles and liver.</p><p>Lipoatrophy coexists with fat accumulation in a number of patients. Dyslipidemia and disordered glucose metabolism are also often seen in patients with HIV-associated fat accumulation. (See <a href=\"#H18746734\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic abnormalities'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We routinely evaluate HIV-infected patients on ART for the development of fat accumulation. The diagnosis of HIV-associated fat accumulation is made by detection of characteristic findings on visual inspection and physical examination (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above). Abdominal obesity can be detected and quantified by simple measures, including measurement of the waist circumference. An abdominal circumference &gt;102 cm for men and &gt;88 cm for women is considered abnormal and considered more accurate than a <span class=\"nowrap\">waist/hip</span> circumference ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. If the ratio of <span class=\"nowrap\">waist/hip</span> measure increased because of decrease in hip circumference, it may be mistakenly interpreted as increasing abdominal girth.</p><p>HIV-associated abdominal fat accumulation is predominantly visceral but appears similar to simple obesity, in which visceral fat is also accompanied by increased amounts of subcutaneous fat in the abdominal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72033\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72033 \">figure 1</a>). An inability to pinch the fat in the setting of abdominal obesity is suggestive of visceral fat accumulation, which cannot be palpated externally. Quantitative measurements of visceral adipose tissue can be assessed by CT or MRI, but these are usually done in research trials only. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measures trunk fat but cannot distinguish between visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and is not recommended.</p><p>Keeping a log of weight, BMI, and measures of waist, hip, and mid-upper-arm circumferences can be useful. Measuring height and weight to calculate the BMI, which can be followed over time, may also be useful to detect progressive changes, although patients with fat redistribution can have increased visceral fat but a normal or only modestly elevated BMI. If the BMI is stable and the waist circumference is increasing, this strongly suggests that lipoatrophy is also occurring. It may also be useful to follow the evolution of body shape changes or places where the body shape is disproportionate.</p><p>Although HIV-infected patients should be routinely assessed for abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism regardless of lipodystrophy, the presence of fat accumulation should prompt such evaluation if not already performed.

In HIV-infected patients with fat accumulation in the dorsocervical region (buffalo hump), an alternative possible cause is Cushing&rsquo;s syndrome, which can be distinguished by the presence of hypercortisolism.
