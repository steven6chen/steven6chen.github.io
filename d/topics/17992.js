Primary infection with VZV causes varicella (chickenpox) in susceptible hosts. Most healthy children have self-limited infection with primary varicella. However, varicella can cause severe complications such as soft tissue infection, pneumonia, hepatitis, Reye syndrome, and encephalitis. Patients at increased risk of complications include adolescents, adults, pregnant women, and immunocompromised hosts. </p><p>The treatment of primary varicella infection will be reviewed here. Issues related to the transmission, clinical manifestations, and complications of varicella, as well as the management of pregnant women and neonates, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-chickenpox\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of varicella-zoster virus infection: Chickenpox&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Varicella-zoster virus infection in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Varicella-zoster infection in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with varicella typically develop a fever and a vesicular rash that is pruritic. Many patients require supportive care to manage these symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> below.)</p><p>The decision to initiate antiviral therapy depends upon the patient&rsquo;s age, the presence or absence of comorbid conditions, and the patient&rsquo;s clinical presentation. Although varicella is usually a self-limited disease, if complications develop, they can be life-threatening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-chickenpox#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of varicella-zoster virus infection: Chickenpox&quot;, section on 'Complications of varicella'</a>.)</p><p>Our approach to antiviral therapy is as follows (see <a href=\"#H618615445\" class=\"local\">'Individuals without complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H252835606\" class=\"local\">'Individuals with complications'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For healthy children &le;12 years, varicella is typically self-limited and we do not routinely offer antiviral therapy. The management of neonatal varicella is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-infection-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Varicella-zoster infection in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals who present with, or are at high risk for complications (eg, unvaccinated adolescents, adults, pregnant women, immunocompromised hosts), we administer antiviral therapy to reduce the severity of symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduce the risk of complications. </p><p/><p>We use oral therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>) for immunocompetent individuals without evidence of complications. The oral agents are well tolerated and there are few serious side effects associated with their use. For most others, we use intravenous acyclovir rather than oral therapy since the bioavailability of intravenous therapy is better than that of the oral agents and it has been widely used for the treatment of immunocompromised hosts.</p><p>All patients with varicella should be educated about potential complications, including secondary bacterial infections. (See <a href=\"#H1944531840\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORTIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following general measures can be used for the symptomatic management of rash and fever, and can also help reduce the risk of developing certain complications: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antihistamines are helpful for the symptomatic treatment of pruritus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fingernails should be closely cropped to avoid significant excoriation and secondary bacterial infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> should be used to treat fever, particularly in children. Nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents can also be used. However, some providers discourage NSAIDS because of the uncertain association with streptococcal superinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-varicella-chickenpox-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Salicylates should be <strong>avoided</strong> since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> has been associated with the onset of Reye syndrome in the setting of a viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-varicella-chickenpox-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Higher doses of acyclovir are used to treat VZV compared with herpes simplex virus (HSV). VZV is less susceptible to acyclovir, and 50 percent inhibition of VZV replication requires about 10-fold higher levels of acyclovir than those typically required for HSV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-varicella-chickenpox-infection/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. Acyclovir and its analogues are dependent upon renal function for clearance and dose adjustment is needed in moderate to severe renal insufficiency.</p><p>Oral agents are generally very well tolerated, especially in adults; however, gastrointestinal side effects or headache may occur. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acyclovir</a> is also available in an intravenous form which can cause local reactions (phlebitis) and reversible acute kidney injury. Risk factors for acute kidney injury include dehydration, failure to dose adjust for reduced kidney function, and overly rapid infusion (eg, &lt;1 hour) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-varicella-chickenpox-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, for obese adults, weight-based dosing should be scaled to ideal body weight (IBW) rather than actual body weight (ABW) to avoid an increased risk of toxicity (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ideal-body-weight-method-of-devine-and-dosing-weight-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). </p><p>Additional discussions on the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> and its analogues are found in the Lexicomp drug information topics within UpToDate and within individual topic reviews.

Varicella is typically a self-limited disease in this population. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> may modestly reduce the duration and severity of symptoms, these benefits must be weighed against the adverse effects (including rare but potentially serious adverse effects), cost, and potential transmission of infection during the office visit to obtain the prescription. </p><p>The modest effects of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> are summarized below: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial of 815 healthy children with varicella evaluated the effects of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-varicella-chickenpox-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Individuals received placebo or acyclovir therapy (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> PO four times daily), which was started within the first 24 hours after the onset of the rash and continued for five days. Acyclovir-treated children had fewer lesions than the placebo group (mean number 294 versus 347), and no new lesions formed after day three in the acyclovir group, while 20 percent of the control group continued to develop lesions on day six or later.

Many patients require supportive care to manage these symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For healthy children &le;12 years, varicella is typically self-limited and we suggest <strong>not</strong> administering antiviral therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, we suggest antiviral therapy for immunocompetent children and adolescents who are at increased risk of developing complications from varicella (eg, unvaccinated patients &ge;13 years old, individuals with chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorders, those taking chronic salicylates or inhaled steroids) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H167447358\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompetent children and adolescents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For immunocompetent adults with uncomplicated varicella infection, we suggest oral antiviral therapy in addition to supportive care rather than supportive care alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Antiviral therapy can reduce the severity of symptoms and may decrease the risk of complications. We initiate antiviral therapy, regardless of the individual&rsquo;s vaccination status. We typically administer oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> because it can be given in fewer doses compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> and has equivalent activity. (See <a href=\"#H167447855\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompetent adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For immunocompromised individuals who present with varicella, we recommend antiviral treatment in addition to supportive care rather than supportive care alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For most patients, we suggest initial therapy with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> rather than oral agents (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Treatment should be administered for 7 to 10 days. (See <a href=\"#H1944532770\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised hosts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnant women who develop uncomplicated varicella, we suggest oral antiviral therapy rather than supportive care (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The management of pregnant women with varicella is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Varicella-zoster virus infection in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Treatment of varicella infection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals who present with complications related to varicella, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> should be initiated.
