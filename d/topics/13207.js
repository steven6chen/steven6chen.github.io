The incidence of pectus excavatum is 1 in every 400 to 1000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It is three to five times more prevalent in males than females. It is usually sporadic, but may be associated with connective tissue disorders, neuromuscular disease, and some genetic conditions. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there is no consensus for what causes pectus excavatum (PE), there have been a number of hypotheses, ranging from disproportionate muscular force putting abnormal stress and strain on the sternum and costal cartilages, to defective cartilage structure and growth, abnormal rib growth, or combinations thereof [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>An early theory that PE is caused by abnormal diaphragmatic connections was discarded, because surgical interventions to release the central tendon and substernal ligament in early childhood were not effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pectus-excavatum-treatment#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pectus excavatum: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Historical approaches'</a>.)</p><p>PE is usually sporadic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but it has been associated with connective tissue disorders (particularly Marfan syndrome, Ehlers Danlos syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and neuromuscular disease (eg, spinal muscular atrophy). It also can be seen in a variety of other genetic conditions, including Noonan syndrome, Turner syndrome, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The increased prevalence of PE in connective tissue disorders suggests the possibility that it is caused by abnormal cartilage development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In particular, some authors have hypothesized that the deformity is caused by abnormalities of cartilage remodeling due to an imbalance between cartilage growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Genetic contributors to PE seem likely, and familial patterns of inheritance have occasionally been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Several different genes affecting cartilage growth are associated with syndromic causes of PE (eg, fibrillin1 gene in Marfan syndrome and genes in the RasMAPK pathway in Noonan syndrome). However, no specific genetic triggers for abnormal cartilage growth in nonsyndromic (isolated) PE have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cartilage samples from patients with pectus excavatum have normal histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>PE may also occur in response to underlying pulmonary conditions. Patients with a repaired congenital diaphragmatic hernia are prone to PE, presumably because the axis of contraction of the diaphragm is more horizontal than vertical, so that the diaphragm pulls the lower edge of the sternum inward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 are also prone to developing PE, presumably because the chest wall is highly compliant and unable to resist intrapleural pressure variation during respiration; these forces gradually deform the sternum over time. PE also can occur in children with subglottic stenosis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-in-the-neonate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital diaphragmatic hernia in the neonate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-muscular-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal muscular atrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span></p><p>Information on the evolution of untreated pectus excavatum (PE) is based upon limited retrospective data and reports of clinical impressions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].

However, there is poor correlation between the severity of PE and concern about appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One longitudinal study suggests that cosmetic concerns subside over time: among patients with mild PE who did not undergo surgery, the concern about appearance usually subsided by 18 to 20 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among a large group of patients evaluated for severe PE, most of whom were in the pediatric age range, the following symptoms were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise intolerance &mdash; 82 percent </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain &mdash; 68 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor endurance &mdash; 67 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath &mdash; 42 percent</p><p/><p>In a separate study, similar frequencies of these problems were reported in a group of 50 adults with PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. While young children are less likely to display these symptoms, they may develop during adolescence, sometimes in as little as six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1913962527\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SPECIALTY CONSULTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical significance of a patient's pectus excavatum (PE) depends upon the severity of the chest wall defect, cardiopulmonary morbidity, and its psychosocial impact (patient&rsquo;s concern about his or her appearance). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mild PE (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below), cardiopulmonary function is almost always normal, and the presence or absence of cosmetic concerns is the primary indication for consultation for possible surgical correction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with moderate or severe PE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with complaints suggesting cardiorespiratory compromise should be evaluated by computed tomography (CT) to quantify the severity of PE.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p/><p>The timing for referral also depends on the patients age. PE rarely improves after six years of age, and one-third of cases progress during the adolescent growth spurt (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Natural History'</a> above). If surgery is performed to correct the defect, the optimal timing is late childhood or early adolescence.

A low threshold for evaluation is appropriate; one retrospective study demonstrated that the level of physical symptoms correlated poorly with severity of deformity on chest CT imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients with any respiratory complaints or who are surgical candidates should also undergo pulmonary function testing to assess for restrictive respiratory disease. Selected patients should have exercise testing to assess for cardiopulmonary limitation. Patients with significant displacement of the heart or cardiopulmonary limitation, should be evaluated with echocardiography and electrocardiography. &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p>For patients not deemed to be candidates for surgical correction after the initial evaluation, it is important to repeat the focused physical examination and imaging periodically. This is especially important during periods of rapid growth, such as adolescence, because the deformity and associated symptoms may increase markedly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Some clinicians also measure the chest quantitatively using calipers to measure the distance between point of maximal sternal depression and the spine, and the transverse thoracic diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115408\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115408 \">figure 1</a>). However, there are no standards for defining PE severity based on these measurements, so the primary use is to document the deformity including chest asymmetry and monitor changes over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

One author suggested that a depth of &gt;2.5 cm constitutes a moderate to severe defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic abnormalities &ndash; In addition to the sternal depression, patients with PE often have a narrowed chest wall diameter in the sagittal (anteroposterior) plane and a flat, broad, and often kyphotic chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Between 10 and 39 percent of patients with PE also have associated scoliosis, which may be severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/2,7,20,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,20,27,28</a>].

Patients with more severe forms of pectus excavatum are much more likely to have reduced aerobic capacity. Upper or lower respiratory abnormalities are uncommon findings on physical exams. However, an association between laryngomalacia and pectus excavatum has been reported, especially in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a retrospective study of children presenting with laryngomalacia, 6.6 percent were found to have pectus excavatum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This suggests that the pectus deformity may develop in response to prolonged increased inspiratory work and is not always a primary deformity.

As an example, the pectus gracilis index (PGI) is the ratio of the lateral diameter of the chest to the sternum-to-spine distance at the gladiolus-manubrial junction (ie, at a point above the maximal sternal depression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

For detecting cardiopulmonary abnormalities, exercise testing is more sensitive than spirometry or thoracic gas volume measurements performed at rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/1,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,39</a>]. This may be because exercise testing evaluates the interplay between the cardiac and pulmonary systems. </p><p>Exercise testing demonstrates mild impairment in some patients with severe PE, and the degree of impairment correlates with the severity of the defect. In patients with PE, small case series have shown reduced maximal exercise capacity (as measured by VO2max) due to low stroke volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]; and reduced maximal oxygen uptake and threshold for lactate accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In another study, the tidal <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/FVC</span> was lower, and the respiratory rate higher during exercise testing in patients with PE as compared with normal controls, perhaps indicating a higher metabolic cost of breathing in a mechanically inefficient system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1026141897\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac Function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with significant displacement of the heart on imaging, or cardiopulmonary limitation, should have a cardiology evaluation with echocardiography and electrocardiography. A cardiac evaluation is also appropriate for patients with syndromes associated with cardiac malformations, such as Turner or Noonan syndrome. Patients with PE commonly have cardiac displacement to the left. In one large series of female patients, 68 percent had electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Electrocardiographic evidence of right axis deviation and ST segment depression in patients with severe PE usually reflects rotation and compression of the heart rather than an intrinsic myocardial abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Echocardiography has demonstrated subtle right ventricular outflow obstruction and reduced right ventricular systolic function in patients with severe PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>], and these measures improve after surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Accordingly, a study using intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated relief of right heart chamber compression and improved cardiac output immediately after surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pectus-excavatum-treatment#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pectus excavatum: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Outcomes'</a>). The cardiac distortion may be associated with conduction abnormalities, such as bundle branch block, which were present in 16 percent of patients in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In a case series of patients with severe PE (PSI 5.2 &plusmn; 1.3), cardiac MRI testing showed cardiac strain in the mid and apical ventricles, and smaller ventricular volumes, compared with unaffected controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pectus-excavatum-etiology-and-evaluation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pectus excavatum (PE), is a deformity of the chest wall characterized by a sternal depression beginning over the midportion of the manubrium and progressing inward toward the xiphoid process.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PE is usually sporadic, but it has been associated with connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers Danlos syndrome, neuromuscular disease, and a variety of other genetic conditions, including Noonan syndrome and Turner syndrome. The pathogenesis of PE and reasons for these associations are not well established. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PE can be present at birth, and in some cases may resolve. However, it tends to worsen during the rapid growth of adolescence. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Natural History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PE typically present with cosmetic concerns, but some patients also report exercise intolerance and shortness of breath. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of a patient with moderate or severe PE includes quantification of the sternal depression using measurements from a chest computerized tomography (CT) scan, particularly the pectus severity index, PSI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78522\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78522 \">figure 2</a>). A typical candidate for surgery usually has a PSI of &gt;3.25. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision of whether and when to refer a patient for specialty consultation depends on the severity of the defect and the patient&rsquo;s age and cardiopulmonary symptoms (see <a href=\"#H1913962527\" class=\"local\">'Indications for specialty consultation'</a> above). Surgery is typically performed during late childhood or early adolescence. Indications for surgery are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pectus-excavatum-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pectus excavatum: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidates for possible surgical intervention should undergo pulmonary function testing. In addition, some patients should undergo electrocardiography and echocardiography, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing as part of a specialist referral. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>On pulmonary function testing, lung volumes such as forced vital capacity (FVC) are often normal. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exercise testing demonstrates mild impairment in many patients with PE. The impairment correlates with the severity of the defect, and is consistent with cardiovascular dysfunction rather than ventilatory limitation or physical deconditioning. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Exercise Testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electrocardiography may demonstrate right axis deviation and ST segment depression, which reflects rotation and compression of the heart. Some patients have conduction abnormalities, such as bundle branch block. Echocardiography may demonstrate subtle right ventricular outflow obstruction and reduced right ventricular systolic function in patients with severe PE.
