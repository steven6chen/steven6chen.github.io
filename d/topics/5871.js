Furthermore, cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with a lower incidence of mortality from cardiovascular disease and from all causes.

Furthermore, high levels of physical activity (2200 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/week)</span> may be associated with regression of existing lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

This topic will review the influence of aerobic training on lipoproteins as a function of exercise intensity and frequency in both healthy subjects and patients with CHD and describe the evidence for beneficial changes in hemostatic factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INFLUENCE OF EXERCISE ON LIPIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early cross-sectional studies comparing middle-aged male runners to sedentary men suggested a beneficial effect of exercise on lipoproteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The runners had significantly lower serum levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides, and a higher concentration of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol.</p><p>Subsequent studies have found variable results when looking at the effect of exercise on the lipoproteins measured in a typical lipid profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/5-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-17</a>]. However, these studies have varied in design, length of follow-up, and exercise intensity, making it difficult to form definitive conclusions. The magnitude of the effect of exercise on lipoproteins appears to be related to the intensity and duration of the exercise program, individual variation, and whether exercise also produces weight reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In one of the best performed prospective studies, 111 sedentary overweight men and women with mild to moderate dyslipidemia were randomly assigned to one of four groups&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High amount, high intensity exercise for eight months, the caloric equivalent of jogging 20 miles (32 km) per week at 65 to 80 percent of peak oxygen consumption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low amount, high intensity exercise for eight months, the caloric equivalent of jogging 12 miles (19.2 km) per week at 65 to 80 percent of peak oxygen consumption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low amount, moderate intensity exercise for eight months, the equivalent of walking 12 miles (19.2 km) per week at 40 to 55 percent of peak oxygen consumption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control group</p><p/><p>Compared with controls, all exercising groups had potentially beneficial changes in plasma lipoproteins, including a decrease in VLDL triglycerides and an increase in the size of LDL particles. An increase in HDL cholesterol and particle size and the largest effects on LDL were seen only with high amount, high intensity exercise. None of these improvements, except for those in HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, would have been detected by a standard lipid profile. The beneficial effects of exercise on lipoproteins occurred even though there were only small decreases in body weight, suggesting the effects were due to the exercise itself rather than weight loss.</p><p>These results are supported by a study in older men and women who had lipoproteins measured at baseline and following 24 weeks of exercise training. Most measurements improved with exercise, and these changes were independent of diet, baseline body fat, and change in body fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The amount of exercise made a larger difference on plasma lipoprotein concentrations than the intensity of exercise. The effect was graded, so that higher amounts of exercise were associated with greater benefits in lipoproteins. Nevertheless, even low amounts of exercise were able to limit or prevent much of the weight gain and worsening of the overall lipoprotein profile that was observed in the control group.</p><p>Other studies have confirmed the graded effect that the amount of exercise has on serum lipoproteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/17,21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21-25</a>]. The concept that the amount of physical activity is more important than the level of fitness with regard to improvement in the lipoprotein profile is supported by a study that randomly assigned 149 men and 120 postmenopausal women to one of three exercise programs for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High intensity (73 to 85 percent peak heart rate) group-based; there were three 40 minute session per week</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High intensity home-based</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low intensity (60 to 73 percent peak heart rate) home-based; there were five 30 minute sessions per week</p><p/><p>Serum HDL-cholesterol did not change at one year but showed a small but significant increase above baseline at two years in subjects in the two home-based programs. The elevation in HDL-cholesterol was more pronounced in the low-intensity program, suggesting that increased frequency of exercise may be important and that maximum increases in fitness (as seen with high intensity exercise) is not required.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials (n = 984) found that aerobic exercise resulted in an 11 percent increase in HDL2-cholesterol, independent of weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The Health, Risk Factors, Exercise Training and Genetics (HERITAGE) Family Study characterized 200 men on the basis of baseline triglyceride and HDL cholesterol concentrations. Subjects underwent a 20-week endurance exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Men with high <span class=\"nowrap\">triglyceride/low</span> HDL cholesterol profiles had the greatest HDL raising effect from exercise (4.9 percent) compared with men with normal levels and men with isolated low HDL cholesterol. In addition, the only significant correlate of the increase in HDL-cholesterol with exercise training in men with high <span class=\"nowrap\">triglycerides/low</span> HDL cholesterol was a reduction in subcutaneous adipose tissue.</p><p>The earlier studies confirmed the benefits of exercise volume on lipids. A study in obese adolescent females showed that 12 weeks of high intensity interval training was superior to continuous moderate intensity exercise for improving lipid levels, specifically triglycerides and total cholesterol, as well as waist circumference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. &#160;</p><p>A 2011 study evaluated the early effects of exercise training on HDL-cholesterol levels and HDL functional characteristics in a small group of sedentary patients with metabolic syndrome (MS) versus those without MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Following three months of moderate-intensity bicycle exercise, the MS group had lower triglycerides but no change in LDL- or HDL-cholesterol levels. However, an increase in the HDL&rsquo;s subfraction oxidative capacity and paraoxonase-1 activity increased following exercise training. Further, the MS group had compositional changes in the smallest HDL subfractions associated with increased free cholesterol and cholesterol ester transfers to HDL. The study demonstrates a dissociation between the level of HDL-cholesterol and qualitative changes after short-term exercise training in MS patients, thus highlighting the need to explore the functionality of HDL in addition to the level of HDL.</p><p>HDL functionality has emerged as an important consideration in evaluating the effects of interventions on HDL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a study of 22 obese men with the metabolic syndrome, pre- and post-treatment effects of diet and exercise were evaluated at three weeks. Following exercise, the intervention reduced lipid peroxides and improved the anti-oxidant effect of HDL as measured by platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolyase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Gender and physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] studies have found that exercise training produces different results on the lipoprotein profile in men and women. As an example, one study randomly assigned 132 men and 132 women to diet only (step 1 American Heart Association diet), diet plus exercise, and a control condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Exercise consisted of brisk walking and jogging three days a week for 25 to 45 minutes at 60 to 80 percent of HRmax. After one year, the following findings were observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men and women in both intervention groups lost weight (primarily fat). However, weight loss by diet alone did not change serum HDL-cholesterol compared with controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In men, serum HDL-cholesterol, HDL2-cholesterol, and apo A-l concentrations increased significantly more with diet plus exercise group than in the other two groups (+13 versus +2 and -4 percent with diet alone or control) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50708\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50708 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women, diet alone was associated with reductions in serum HDL-cholesterol (-10 percent), HDL2-cholesterol, and apo A-l. When exercise was added, the decrease in HDL-cholesterol was abolished, and was not statistically different from controls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50708\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50708 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum triglyceride concentrations decreased in the combined intervention groups, whereas the <span class=\"nowrap\">LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol</span> ratio, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apo B levels were reduced in both intervention groups.</p><p/><p>Another study of 180 postmenopausal women and 197 men who were randomized to exercise (brisk walking for one hour three days a week), a step 2 diet, diet plus exercise or control found that after one year, there was no change in HDL-cholesterol in either gender in any study group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There was no change in total or LDL-cholesterol in the diet only group; however, compared to control, there was a significant reduction in total and LDL-cholesterol levels in the diet plus exercise group. These data underscore the importance of diet and physical activity in the treatment of elevated LDL-cholesterol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise for secondary prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise training programs produce favorable changes in the lipoprotein profile in patients who already have coronary heart disease (CHD). Most studies have shown a significant increase in serum HDL-cholesterol and a decrease in serum triglycerides compared with baseline values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>], while others have also shown a reduction in serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35</a>]. These favorable changes in part correlated with weight loss. The usual exercise intervention is three days per week, 30 to 45 minutes in duration, at 70 to 80 percent HRmax or VO2max, for 12 to 29 weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-programs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation programs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One study evaluated the long-term benefits of exercise rehabilitation on lipoproteins in 553 men and 166 women with CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. After one year, both men and women had a significant increase in serum HDL-cholesterol; however, serum HDL-cholesterol continued to increase over five years only in women. Serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol decreased significantly more in women, while no gender difference was observed for serum triglycerides. Other studies have also suggested gender differences in changes in HDL-cholesterol in response to exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials (n = 1260) found that aerobic exercise in patients with cardiovascular disease increased HDL-cholesterol by 9 percent and triglycerides by 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. No statistically significant changes occurred in total cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol, and no relationship was observed between changes in lipoproteins and body weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential mechanisms of benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms by which aerobic exercise has a favorable impact on the lipoprotein profile are not fully understood; however, some information has come from the measurement of enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolic pathways. Exercise increases lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and reduces hepatic lipase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/4,8,10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,10,12</a>]. The elevation in LPL activity suggests that enhanced lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins may be an initial step in higher serum levels of HDL-cholesterol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hdl-cholesterol-clinical-aspects-of-abnormal-values#H3415187079\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HDL cholesterol: Clinical aspects of abnormal values&quot;, section on 'Inherited causes'</a>.) Furthermore, hepatic lipase catalyzes the conversion of the larger HDL2 particles to the smaller HDL3 particles; reduced hepatic lipase with exercise may lead to slower catabolism of HDL2, which may be more cardioprotective (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61616 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Exercise is also associated with a reduction in the serum cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and an elevation in the serum lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CETP catalyzes the net flux of cholesterol from HDL-cholesterol to VLDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. Basal CETP concentrations have been shown to correlate negatively with HDL-cholesterol after exercise training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LCAT catalyzes the esterification of cholesterol located on the particle surface; cholesterol is subsequently displaced to the core, which is the initial event in the conversion of HDL3 to the cholesterol-rich HDL2 particles.</p><p/><p>Exercise training also may have a modest effect on serum LDL-cholesterol. Studies have evaluated the influence of exercise on the chemical composition of LDL. Smaller and more dense LDL particles tend to be more atherogenic than the larger, more buoyant LDL subfraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-disorders-of-ldl-cholesterol-metabolism-other-than-familial-hypercholesterolemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited disorders of LDL-cholesterol metabolism other than familial hypercholesterolemia&quot;</a>.) Although calculated serum LDL-cholesterol levels are usually unchanged after exercise, LDL peak particle diameter increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] and changes in the chemical composition of LDL (increased LDL free cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and phospholipid content) are associated with decreased adiposity, abdominal girth, and plasma insulin and glucose concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic variability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise training produces characteristic changes in lipids in most, but not all, people. Some of the variability in response appears to be due to genetic factors. As an example, apolipoprotein E (Apo E) variants may modify the response to exercise. Apo E facilitates triglyceride clearance by mediating the binding of VLDL and intermediate-density lipoproteins to hepatic receptors. A study of response to exercise training in 120 individuals selected to equally represent the three most common Apo E variants <span class=\"nowrap\">(E2/3,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">E3/3,</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">E3/4)</span> found trends toward different lipoprotein responses to exercise among the various subgroups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A subsequent study examined the effects of Apo E genotype on the response of lipoprotein subclass concentrations to six months of exercise. Results showed that Apo E variants influenced the LDL subpopulation response to exercise, and subjects homozygous for Apo E3 experienced the most beneficial lipoprotein effects from exercise training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Exercise also produced different HDL subfraction patterns based on genetic variation at the Apo A-I gene promoter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Apo A-I is the major apolipoprotein associated with HDL-cholesterol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">INFLUENCE OF EXERCISE ON HEMOSTATIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Platelets, high levels of plasma fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) activity, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen, and increased plasma viscosity play important roles in the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease.

The following effects have been noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate intensity exercise for eight weeks in men reduced resting and post-exercise platelet adhesion and aggregation compared to controls; return to pretraining values occurred after 12 weeks of deconditioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cross-sectional study of physically active and sedentary postmenopausal women, VO2max was 83 percent higher, and PAI-1 activity and t-PA antigen were significantly lower in the physically active women; plasma fibrinogen levels were the same in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large-scale observational study of 3522 subjects found an inverse association between self-reported leisure-time physical activity and plasma viscosity in both men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, in another report, a 10-week program of moderate intensity aerobic exercise did not alter whole blood viscosity in patients with CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small study found that men with intermittent claudication who underwent a six-month exercise program experienced significant improvements in fibrinolytic activity, while no change was seen in matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-exercise-on-lipoproteins-and-hemostatic-factors/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, although a training program of short duration may not be adequate to reduce blood viscosity, it appears that aerobic exercise improves hemostatic factors associated with thrombosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H472188367\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms by which physical activity protects against coronary heart disease (CHD) are not fully understood.
