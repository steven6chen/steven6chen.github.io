Birth defects can be isolated or present in a characteristic combination or pattern that may affect one or more organ systems. A genetic disorder or genetic abnormality is caused by a change or mutation in the genome that often leads to a medical consequence. Even though most genetic disorders are congenital, they can have a delayed clinical presentation or even adult onset. These disorders can be inherited or the result of a new mutation.</p><p>This topic discusses the causes of birth defects.

These defects include point mutations as well as small insertions or deletions (indels) that disrupt gene copying and protein synthesis. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or sex linked. A single defect in one copy of a gene on an autosomal chromosome (not a sex X or Y chromosome) causes disease in disorders with autosomal dominant inheritance. In this case, the patient is heterozygous for the genetic defect. In disorders with autosomal recessive inheritance, both alleles of a gene on a autosomal chromosome are mutated, either the same mutation (homozygous mutation) or two different mutations (compound heterozygous). The last form of inheritance is sex linked (X-linked recessive inheritance is most common). Autosomal recessive conditions are more common when there is parental consanguinity (related as second cousins or closer). (See <a href=\"#H251793790\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-genetic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of genetic disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As an example, a series of patients with multiple congenital malformations (including cardiac and vertebral defects) and their family members underwent whole exome or whole genome sequencing in an attempt to identify a genetic defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Predicted pathogenic loss-of-function variants in two genes (<em>HAAO</em>, encoding 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid 3,4-dioxygenase, and <em>KYNU</em>, encoding kynureninase) leading to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) were identified in four families (three consanguineous, three with a history of miscarriages), with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The mutated proteins are enzymes in the kynurenine pathway that are involved in the de novo synthesis of NAD through catabolism of dietary tryptophan. NAD is also produced through the NAD salvage pathway using dietary niacin as the substrate. In vitro activity of the truncated enzymes was low to absent, upstream metabolites were elevated, and downstream metabolites were reduced. Supplementation of dietary niacin during gestation in <em>Haao</em>-null or <em>Kynu</em>-null mice, which corrected the NAD deficiency, prevented intrauterine death and abnormal embryogenesis.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1671907210\"><span class=\"h1\">TERATOGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A teratogen is an agent that can cause abnormalities in the form or function of a developing fetus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73369 \">table 1</a>). It acts by producing cell death, altering normal growth of tissues, or interfering with normal cellular differentiation or other morphologic processes. The consequences of these actions can be fetal loss, fetal growth restriction, birth defects (eg, a limb reduction), or impaired neurologic performance (eg, altered neural connections in the central nervous system in fetal alcohol syndrome).</p><p>Approximately 4 to 6 percent of birth defects are caused by exposure to teratogens in the environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These include maternal illnesses (eg, diabetes mellitus or phenylketonuria [PKU]), infectious agents (eg, TORCH - <strong>T</strong>oxoplasmosis, <strong>O</strong>ther [syphilis, varicella-zoster, parvovirus B19], <strong>R</strong>ubella, <strong>C</strong>ytomegalovirus, and <strong>H</strong>erpes - infections), physical agents (eg, radiation or heat exposure), and drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">thalidomide</a>, antiepileptic drugs) and chemical agents (eg, mercury).</p><p>Response to the teratogenic agent is highly individual and is influenced by multiple factors. These include maternal and fetal genotypes (genetic susceptibility), the dose of the agent, route of exposure, timing of exposure, and concurrent exposures or illnesses during gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2522579882\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic makeup of both the fetus and the mother determine the relative resistance or susceptibility to teratogenic agents. The degree of genetic susceptibility is separate from any specific genetic conditions that are known direct causes of birth defects.</p><p>As an example, albeit an oversimplified one, fetuses with defects in folate metabolism (eg, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [<em>MTHFR</em>] gene mutations) appear to be at increased risk for structural malformations such as neural tube defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], cleft lip and palate, and cardiac malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The risk of these malformations may be decreased by maternal supplementation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a> in the preconceptional period and in early pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Thus, a malformation such as an open neural tube defect may result from genetic susceptibility related to a combination of factors consisting of the presence of a fetal <em>MTHFR</em> gene defect and a state of inadequate maternal folate intake.</p><p>Another example is that some fetuses have low or deficient epoxide hydrolase activity that results in increased levels of teratogenic oxidative metabolites when they are exposed to antiepileptic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Finally, certain birth defects may be seen with different frequencies across races or sexes.&nbsp;For example, postaxial polydactyly is more common in African Americans (approximately 1 percent) than Caucasians (approximately 0.1 percent). Neural tube defects are more common in Caucasians than African Americans. Pyloric stenosis and cleft lip are more common in males than females.</p><p>The genetic makeup of the mother and her state of health also play a role in teratogenesis. The production of a malformation is dependent upon the ability of a woman to absorb and metabolize a teratogen. In addition, maternal medical disease states can act as teratogens. (See <a href=\"#H1871409813\" class=\"local\">'Maternal illnesses'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3847499768\"><span class=\"h2\">Route of exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The route of exposure can also impact teratogenic effects. For example, the absorption and action of a drug is usually different if exposure is through the dermis versus systemic delivery. The systemic route may cause abnormalities, while the dermal delivery may not. As an example, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> applied to the skin is considered safe, but systemic fluconazole is potentially teratogenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Another example is topical use of retinoic acid versus <span class=\"nowrap\">oral/systemic</span> use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3570750487\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose and duration of exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose and duration of the embryo's exposure to a teratogen are also important. Most drugs exhibit threshold effects (ie, there is a dose below which the incidence of embryonic death, malformation, growth restriction, or functional impairment is not greater than for unexposed controls). Such thresholds are usually one to three orders of magnitude below the teratogenic dose of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>When no human data are available, a dose teratogenic in animals that is less than 10-fold higher than the maximum human therapeutic dose suggests a high risk that the drug may be teratogenic in humans. A 100-fold difference between the animal teratogenic dose and the maximal human dose indicates a low risk of potential human teratogenicity. However, teratogenic agents may have different effects in different species. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">thalidomide</a> is not teratogenic in rabbits, but has devastating effects in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, many drugs produce malformations in animals when given at 10 to 1000 times the normal dose administered to humans. Extrapolating teratogenic risk using these data is potentially problematic. As an example, high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meclizine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">meclizine</a> given to mice cause cleft palate due to appetite suppression, but force feeding the mice prevents the defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>One teratogen may be more harmful in a single large dose than in the same dose spread over several days, while another teratogen may be more harmful when an exposure is prolonged at a lower dose than if the same dose were given all at once. As an example, binge drinking of seven alcoholic beverages may be more harmful to the fetus than daily intake of only one drink for a week. Conversely, an occasional very high maternal blood glucose in an otherwise well-controlled diabetic mother is probably less harmful than a persistently moderately elevated blood glucose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alcohol intake and pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregestational-diabetes-preconception-counseling-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregestational diabetes: Preconception counseling, evaluation, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Drug-drug interactions can also be important. Two drugs administered together may have synergistic effects, the drugs may act completely independently, or one drug may protect against the teratogenic effects of the other. As an example, the vitamin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">folic acid</a> may protect against the increased risk of open neural tube defects when taken by women who are taking antiepileptic drugs, such as valproic acid and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carbamazepine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, valproic acid should not be used in pregnancy, if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-epilepsy-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of epilepsy and pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3896141427\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pattern and type of malformation depend in part upon the time of exposure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the site of gene action. A brief review of human embryonic development indicates the system likely to be affected by a problem occurring at that time.</p><p>Fertilization is the first step and occurs within 24 hours of ovulation. Of note, embryonic age is counted from fertilization (conception) and starts two weeks after gestational age, which is counted from the first day of the last menstrual period.

If only a few cells are damaged, then their roles may be compensated by other cells. This is known as the all-or-none theory. An example is an early significant exposure to radiation, which usually results in either pregnancy loss or no abnormalities.</p><p>The embryo is most vulnerable to teratogenic insults since organogenesis is occurring during the embryonic period of development. The embryonic period in humans can be defined as from fertilization until the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> week of gestation (8<sup>th</sup> week postconception) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>During the fetal period, teratogens can cause cell death, retardation of cell growth, or inhibition of normal differentiation. This may result in fetal growth restriction or disorders of the central nervous system that may not be apparent at birth. The eyes, genitalia, central nervous system, and hematopoietic systems continue to develop during the fetal period and remain susceptible to teratogenic insults.</p><p>As an example, the risks associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor exposure are significant during the second and third trimesters (US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] category D) due to blockade of conversion of angiotensinogen I to angiotensin II in the developing fetal kidney. This exposure results in hypotension, renal tubular dysplasia, <span class=\"nowrap\">anuria/oligohydramnios,</span> growth restriction, and calvaria defects. However, these drugs can cause other defects, such congenital heart defects, during the first trimester (FDA category C).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a>, a prostaglandin E1 analog, can cause severe vascular disruptions in the first trimester (ie, terminal limb defects, Moebius syndrome).

As an example, the teratogenic effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">thalidomide</a> for limb defects is limited to 21 to 36 days postconception, when limb bud development begins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2284149801\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of teratogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Teratogenesis is thought to occur after fertilization and results from many diverse mechanisms. These include cell death (eg, radiation), blocking of metabolic processes (eg, thioureas, iodides), and alterations in cellular growth and proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (eg, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder), and interactions between cells or between cells and tissues.</p><p>Exposure prior to conception may theoretically cause genetic mutations, a process known as toxic mutagenesis, although this is a controversial topic. The timing of this process differs in males and females. In females, DNA replication occurs during oogenesis in the fetus, many years before ovulation. In contrast, continuing spermatogenesis makes males susceptible to mutations throughout their reproductive life. Examples include the potential effects of ionizing radiation on spermatogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and potential effects of chemotherapy drugs in the reproductive system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2638135791\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific teratogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous teratogens in the environment can lead to birth defects.

Heat exposure may be due to hot tub or sauna use or maternal fever. Elevation of maternal core temperature more than 1.5&deg;C in the first trimester of pregnancy for at least 24 hours may be associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Other clinical findings associated with high maternal temperature include microcephaly, intellectual disability (mental retardation), hypertonia, hypotonia, and seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrapartum-fever#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrapartum fever&quot;, section on 'Fetal/neonatal consequences'</a>.)</p><p>Excessive exposure to ionizing radiation has the potential to produce fetal death, growth disturbances, somatic abnormalities, mutation, chromosome fragmentation, and malignancy. In general, toxic levels are not achieved with diagnostic imaging. However, knowledge of a pregnancy should, in most circumstances, result in a reappraisal of the necessity for and mode of imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H525523356\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maternal drug ingestion, including prescription and over-the-counter medications as well as recreational drugs, can also cause adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes. However, it can be extremely difficult to determine whether a particular substance is teratogenic. In addition, the timing of exposure during pregnancy can affect the teratogenicity of a drug. A partial list of additional known teratogens is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73369 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that all prescription drugs be tested in animal models, usually one rodent and one nonrodent model. Testing establishes both the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL).&nbsp;If the human exposure level is 100 times lower than the NOAEL, adverse effects in humans are considered unlikely.&nbsp;However, results from animal models may not always apply to humans. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">thalidomide</a> is strongly teratogenic in humans, but weakly teratogenic in animals, while the opposite is true for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a>. A study of drugs approved by the FDA from 2000 to 2010 found that the teratogenic risk in human pregnancy was &quot;undetermined&quot; for 98 percent of the drugs approved for human use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Due to the limitations of drug testing, data regarding the association of drugs or chemicals and birth defects come primarily from case reports of exposed patients. However, these also do not always establish teratogenicity and often need validation by epidemiologic studies. Two promising approaches to providing somewhat better information are prospectively collected exposure data from teratogen information agencies and large-scale birth defects registries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Post-marketing drug registries are also used to monitor for teratogenicity, but these rely on active participation of clinicians and pregnant women and as such are not comprehensive in their surveillance. As previously discussed, some of the drugs can be potentially teratogenic during specific times of fetal development but be innocuous otherwise. (See <a href=\"#H3896141427\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> above.)</p><p>In 2015, the US FDA switched from labeling prescription drugs for use during pregnancy with one of five categories (A, B, C, D, or X), ranging from drugs posing no risk to the fetus to those known to be teratogenic, to the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR or final rule) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The PLLR &quot;requires that the labeling include a summary of the risks of using a drug during pregnancy and lactation, a discussion of the data supporting that summary, and relevant information to help health care providers make prescribing decisions and counsel women about the use of drugs during pregnancy and lactation.&quot;</p><p>Some common teratogenic medications include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3896141427\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticonvulsant agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-associated-with-epilepsy-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks associated with epilepsy and pregnancy&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antineoplastic agents (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gestational-breast-cancer-epidemiology-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gestational breast cancer: Epidemiology and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of classical Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Thalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylene blue</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">penicillamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lithium</a></p><p/><p>Additional known teratogens include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Folic acid</a> antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trimethoprim</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamterene-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">triamterene</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primidone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">primidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a>) increase the risk of neural tube defects and possibly cardiovascular defects, oral clefts, and urinary tract defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/20,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">isotretinoin</a>, used to treat severe acne, is associated with ear anomalies (microtia with or without atresia of the ear canal), central nervous system malformations, hydrocephalus, neuronal brain migration defects, cerebellum abnormalities, severe intellectual disability, seizures, optic <span class=\"nowrap\">nerve/retinal</span> abnormalities, conotruncal heart defects, thymic defects, and dysmorphic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/birth-defects-causes/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].
