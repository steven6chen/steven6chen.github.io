For most HIV-infected individuals treated with potent ART, the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been transformed into a chronic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The impact of antiretroviral therapy on morbidity and mortality of HIV infection in resource-limited settings&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients#H27016986\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Benefits of antiretroviral therapy'</a>.)</p><p>With increased longevity, both AIDS-related and non-AIDS-related malignancies have become an important cause of illness among individuals infected with HIV. The specific malignancies associated with an increased incidence in people infected with HIV are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Management considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22088648\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIORITIZATION BETWEEN CANCER AND HIV TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic therapy of malignancy in patients infected with HIV presents difficult challenges because of the overlapping toxicities and potential drug-drug interactions between anticancer and antiretroviral agents. Avoiding unexpected toxicity or lack of therapeutic effectiveness requires a close collaboration between the infectious disease expert managing the antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection and the medical oncologist treating the cancer.</p><p>Optimal management of HIV infection generally utilizes continuous treatment with multiple antiretroviral agents to minimize the risk of developing resistant HIV strains, opportunistic infection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> death. However, advanced malignancy can pose an immediate threat to health and survival, and this may require that antineoplastic treatment take priority over ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-malignancy-in-patients-on-antiretroviral-medications/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. As the agents utilized to treat both cancer and HIV infection evolve, it may be possible to maintain the optimal regimens to maximize treatment benefit for the HIV infection and malignancy. In the interim, management of regimens may involve alteration of doses to maintain therapeutic efficacy and minimize toxicity or modification of the selection of ART or anticancer drugs to avoid the interactions.</p><p>There are significant risks associated with stopping ART, as was demonstrated when intermittent ART was found to be inferior to constant dosing. Dose modifications or the use of alternative medications for either the ART or the anticancer medications may be required to balance the competing treatment needs. Newer generation antiretroviral drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maraviroc-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">maraviroc</a>) have a decreased risk of drug-drug interactions with anticancer agents and may be reasonable alternatives.

Antiretroviral agents that are a component of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) can act as substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Each drug may affect different isoenzymes, in a manner that is agent-specific.</p><p>An antiretroviral agent may increase the concentration or bioavailability of the anticancer agent by inhibiting or acting as a substrate for a specific isoenzyme that is responsible for the metabolism and clearance of an anticancer agent. This may result in increased toxicity because of the narrow therapeutic index normally associated with these drugs. Conversely, the metabolism and clearance of the anticancer agent may be increased by induction of the relevant CYP450 isoenzyme, thus resulting in decreased efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-malignancy-in-patients-on-antiretroviral-medications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Newer generation antiretroviral drugs (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maraviroc-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">maraviroc</a>) have a decreased propensity for drug-drug interactions with anticancer agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115452\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115452 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The metabolic pathways involved for individual drugs vary significantly, thus making generalizations based upon drug class impossible. Conclusions on potential drug-drug interactions are based upon information about the pharmacokinetic pathways for specific drugs since there is often little or no information available from prospective drug interaction clinical trials. In the following tables, a comprehensive assessment of potential drug-drug interactions is provided. </p><p>An overview of the available information is summarized in two tables, the first describing clinically significant drug interactions for the various antiretroviral agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115452\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115452 \">table 1</a>) and the second providing the same information for commonly used anticancer agents, including cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115451 \">table 2</a>). The list of anticancer agents excludes monoclonal antibodies since drug interactions due to pharmacokinetics are unlikely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-malignancy-in-patients-on-antiretroviral-medications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The tables list two sections: </p><p><strong>1) The route of elimination (as a substrate)</strong>, which provides an assessment of whether or not this drug may need to have a dose adjusted when administered with a drug that could alter its pharmacokinetics, and </p><p><strong>2) The potential to alter another drug as an inducer or inhibitor of the route of elimination.</strong> For each antiretroviral or anticancer drug, the potential to have a clinically significant drug-drug interaction is noted (as a substrate and as <span class=\"nowrap\">inducer/inhibitor)</span> on a scale of 1 (no concern) to 5 (contraindicated). Enzymes that are underlined represent the major route of elimination or concern to alter another drug and will most likely be the pathway that will result in a clinically significant drug-drug interaction. </p><p>This is meant to be a general guide, and consultation with a clinical pharmacist may provide more specific insight. In general, drugs that inhibit a route of elimination may cause the substrate drug to increase to a potentially supratherapeutic or toxic level, resulting in the need to decrease the dose of the substrate. Drugs that induce a route of elimination may cause the substrate drug to decrease to a potentially subtherapeutic level, resulting in the need to increase the dose of the substrate. The exception is drugs that are prodrugs, which require metabolism to their active species. Two common anticancer drugs that are prodrugs are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. In this case, the drug-drug interaction concern is in the opposite direction as drugs that undergo metabolism resulting in a less active or even toxic metabolite.</p><p>For various standard combination chemotherapy regimens, each drug in the regimen should be assessed for the drug interaction potential. In complex regimens, it may be difficult to modify the dose since the doses of each drug in the original combination took into account not only the pharmacokinetics, but also the pharmacodynamics of all agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1060485528\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decisions about switching or stopping antiretroviral regimens should only be made after close consultation between the care provider managing the HIV medications and those managing the cancer chemotherapy.</p><p>There are no formal guidelines to direct treatment and avoid overlapping toxicities and drug-drug interactions when antiretroviral agents and anticancer agents are administered concurrently. Historically, such patients have been excluded from clinical trials. Although this approach is changing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-malignancy-in-patients-on-antiretroviral-medications/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], additional information will be required before the optimal approach to these patients is defined. Additionally, newer generation antiretroviral drugs (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maraviroc-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">maraviroc</a>) have a decreased risk of drug-drug interactions with anticancer agents and may be reasonable alternatives. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22089446\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose modifications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the current time, there is no guidance on dose adjustments of either potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) or chemotherapy in order to minimize drug interactions. The AIDS Malignancy Consortium, a National Cancer Institute-supported clinical trials group, is starting to address this by conducting prospective clinical trials with molecularly-targeted agents in patients on potent ART, and has completed such a trial with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-malignancy-in-patients-on-antiretroviral-medications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Clinicians and clinical investigators should be aware of the potential for interactions that can be inferred from knowledge of drug metabolism and use this information for decision-making.</p><p>The importance of oncologists and specialists in infectious diseases partnering to manage these patients and to discuss strategies using combinations of drugs cannot be overemphasized. As life expectancy for patients with HIV increases, and as more patients develop malignancies (whether HIV related or not), understanding the potential interactions between cancer chemotherapy agents and antiretroviral drugs will grow in importance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22089454\"><span class=\"h2\">Stopping antiretroviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generally, an antiretroviral regimen is modified if necessary rather than discontinued completely in patients receiving systemic anticancer therapy. This is especially valid given the changing landscape of anticancer therapy as we move from cytotoxic to molecularly targeted anticancer agents. Molecularly targeted agents tend to be administered orally on a chronic basis, and thus are not conducive to a temporary interruption of ART, which should be avoided under most circumstances.</p><p>Newer ART, for example an unboosted integrase inhibitor plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, is generally well-tolerated and has a low potential for drug-drug interactions. However, if a patient requires ART containing a boosted protease inhibitor and has no other treatment options, such treatment may be discontinued in patients who are to receive high-dose chemotherapy as preparation for autologous bone marrow transplantation. As an example, an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> (EPOCH) chemotherapy regimen has been used to successfully treated patients with AIDS&ndash;related lymphomas while ART was interrupted to ensure that the maximum intensity of the regimen could be given without toxicity or drug-drug interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-malignancy-in-patients-on-antiretroviral-medications/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Complete remission was induced in 29 of 39 patients (74 percent). After potent ART was reinstituted, viral loads decreased below baseline by three months and CD4 counts recovered by one year. In a study conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), potent ART therapy was interrupted or withheld at the investigators discretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-malignancy-in-patients-on-antiretroviral-medications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There did not appear to be any difference between those who interrupted potent ART and those who continued ART during chemotherapy. </p><p>For individuals who are infected with HIV but have not yet started ART, postponing initiation of antiretroviral therapy, rather than starting with a modified ART, may help avoid the development of antiretroviral drug resistance. Cancer chemotherapy is thus often given first, with ART withheld until overlapping toxicities and pharmacologic interactions are no longer an issue. This strategy is probably less relevant in patients who would start a newer ART regimen, for example an unboosted integrase inhibitor plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.</p><p>Guidelines for the initiation and interruption of ART are discussed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-impact-of-antiretroviral-therapy-on-morbidity-and-mortality-of-hiv-infection-in-resource-limited-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The impact of antiretroviral therapy on morbidity and mortality of HIV infection in resource-limited settings&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Management considerations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients#H27016986\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Benefits of antiretroviral therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent therapy with antiretroviral and anticancer agents can result in a range of overlapping toxicities. These include neurotoxicity, myelotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and cardiotoxicity. (See <a href=\"#H22088694\" class=\"local\">'Overlapping toxicities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a significant potential for drug-drug interactions between certain antiretroviral agents (ie, boosted protease inhibitors or integrase inhibitors) and anticancer drugs (ie, CYP3A4 substrates) because of shared pharmacokinetic pathways and the narrow therapeutic index of these agents. Combinations of an integrase inhibitor and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors have very few drug-drug interactions with commonly used chemotherapy regimens. (See <a href=\"#H22089401\" class=\"local\">'Drug-drug interactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced malignancy can pose an immediate threat to health and survival, and this may require that antineoplastic treatment take priority over antiretroviral therapy. Avoiding unexpected toxicity or lack of therapeutic effect requires a close collaboration between the infectious disease expert managing the ART for HIV infection and the medical oncologist treating the cancer. (See <a href=\"#H22088648\" class=\"local\">'Prioritization between cancer and HIV treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, substitution of alternative antiretroviral agents if necessary, or chemotherapy dose modifications, are preferred in order to minimize toxicity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drug-drug interactions. However, there are no formal guidelines to direct management when patients require concurrent management of both their HIV infection and a malignancy, except for a limited number of chemotherapy agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115452\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115452 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115451 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-therapy-for-malignancy-in-patients-on-antiretroviral-medications/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].
