Recurrent IgA deposition in the allograft is common and may cause hematuria, proteinuria, or progressive renal dysfunction. Among some patients, however, IgA deposits are observed on biopsy, but do not appear to cause clinically significant disease. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. IgA deposition may occur alone or be concurrent with other significant pathology, including chronic rejection.</p><p>Issues related to recurrence after transplantation in patients with IgAN or Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura (IgA vasculitis [IgAV] or HSP) are reviewed here. The pathogenesis, treatment, and prognosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of IgA nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been no large, prospective studies defining the risk of recurrence in patients with IgAN who receive either a living-donor or deceased-donor renal allograft. The reported frequency of histologic or clinically significant recurrence of IgAN varies in the reported literature, with the incidence probably increasing as a function of time from transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Histologic recurrence, with or without evidence of clinical disease, is common. As an example, in a combined retrospective and prospective study that reviewed biopsies from 29 allografts, histologic recurrence of IgA deposition was found in 17 patients (58 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Three of these patients had a normal urinalysis and normal glomeruli on light microscopy, while five had hematuria, heavy proteinuria, hypertension, and progressive renal failure due to IgAN alone. The only predictor for recurrence was a longer time after transplantation (46 versus 15 months in those without recurrence).</p><p>In retrospective analyses of allograft biopsies obtained due to clinical concern for graft dysfunction, the recurrence of IgAN has ranged from 21 to 58 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>].</p><p>The prognosis of patients who develop recurrent IgAN is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H96089893\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96090233\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Possible risk factors for recurrence include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of living-related-donor kidney</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles in recipient including HLA-B35, HLA-DR4, HLA-B8, HLA-DR3</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Good HLA match between donor and recipient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High serum IgA concentration</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of recurrence may be higher among recipients of living-related-donor kidneys, compared with deceased-donor kidneys. Therefore, the expected advantage in allograft survival with a living-related- compared with deceased-donor source may be negated. However, there is <strong>no</strong> basis for avoiding a living-related-donor source, largely due to the reported equivalence of graft survival independent of IgAN recurrence, but also given the expected deceased-donor waiting-list time and a reported decrease in patient mortality and increase in graft survival with earlier transplantation in relation to time on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Conflicting data exist concerning a possible increased risk for recurrent IgAN in recipients of living, related allografts, compared with that with unrelated (living- or deceased-donor) allografts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several retrospective analyses have found no increased risk of recurrence based upon living- versus deceased-donor status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/8,9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,14</a>]. Another report found no difference in risk among recipients of living, related versus living, unrelated donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By comparison, other studies have reported an increased risk of recurrence in recipients of living, related allografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. There was no significant difference in graft survival based upon donor status in some reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], while others reported a survival advantage for living, related donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Human leukocyte antigen effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HLA specificity may affect the likelihood of recurrent IgAN, with the presence of either HLA-B35 or HLA-DR4 increasing the risk in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Other studies noted a higher representation of HLA-B35 and HLA-DR4 in the IgAN population, but their presence had no effect on the incidence of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/6,9,15,18,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,15,18,22,23</a>]. An analysis of the Eurotransplant registry revealed that the 10-year graft survival was significantly lower among patients with IgAN and HLA-B8, DR3 than those with IgAN without HLA-B8, DR3 (52.5 percent versus 69.1 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Graft survival was worse even among those with zero-mismatched kidneys, suggesting that graft loss may be due to factors other than rejection, although no definite association with IgAN recurrence was demonstrated. Conversely, the presence of HLA-B8, DR3 did not influence graft outcomes among control patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">pyelonephritis/interstitial</span> nephritis and polycystic kidney disease (PKD).</p><p>A separate issue is the importance of HLA matching:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 54 patients with 61 renal transplants for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to IgAN, there was a statistically significant decrease in graft survival with <strong>better</strong> HLA-DR matching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/8,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25</a>]. There were insufficient numbers to separately calculate the effect in living-related- versus deceased-donor recipients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A registry study of 1354 patients with end-stage disease due to IgAN from Australia and New Zealand showed that zero-HLA-mismatched living-donor recipients were more likely to develop recurrence (17 percent) than the whole cohort of living and deceased donors (7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, although graft survival did not differ among those with recurrence and zero HLA mismatches compared with one or more HLA mismatches, the survival advantage of zero-antigen HLA mismatches compared with one or more HLA mismatches was lost.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversely, a Korean study found no association with full HLA match and the risk of recurrent IgAN among patients with IgAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum IgA concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increased serum IgA concentration may be a risk factor for recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/17,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,26</a>]. This was suggested by a retrospective analysis of 48 transplant recipients who had biopsy-proven IgAN as a cause of ESRD of the native kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The mean IgA value was higher among 14 patients with recurrence, compared with 34 patients without recurrence (4 versus 3.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L,</span> respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96093778\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no known preventive therapy for IgAN recurrence. Among transplant recipients, there are no conclusive data that the selection of immunosuppressive therapy alters the risk of recurrence. No significant difference, for example, has been observed in the incidence or severity of IgAN in studies comparing the pre- and post-cyclosporine eras [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. There is some evidence that the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil may decrease the risk of IgAN recurrence in the short term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/6,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,27,28</a>]. However, other studies have found no association with mycophenolate and recurrent IgAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. Furthermore, in an analysis of the United States Renal Data System, the use of mycophenolate was associated with a nonsignificant trend towards an increased risk of graft loss due to recurrent IgAN (hazard ratio [HR] 1.79, 95% CI 0.49-6.49) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In this same study, a nonsignificant trend for a decreased risk of graft loss due to recurrent IgAN was associated with the use of steroids (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.12-2.71). However, neither association reached statistical significance. In an analysis of the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) of 1521 first-time kidney transplant recipients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) from IgA, maintenance steroid use was strongly associated with a reduced risk of recurrence (subhazard ratio 0.50, 95% CI 0.30&ndash;0.84) after adjusting for age, sex, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch, dialysis duration, and transplant era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Limited data showed that kidney transplant patients who used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> had less recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Whether the choice of induction agent has any beneficial clinical effect on the incidence of recurrent IgAN is unclear. A retrospective analysis reported that the prevalence of recurrent IgA following transplantation was significantly reduced in patients receiving antithymocyte globulin, compared with either interleukin-2 (IL-2) induction or no induction treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In this report, the 10-year cumulative recurrence rate, as defined by clinically directed biopsy, was 36 percent overall, 9 percent with antithymocyte induction, 41 percent with no induction, and 41 percent at a shorter five-year follow-up with IL-2 induction. Maintenance immunosuppression varied with the era. Graft loss from recurrent IgAN was 6 percent overall, and there was no difference in overall graft or patient survival based on choice of induction agent. Another study found a reduced risk of recurrent glomerulonephritis with antithymocyte globulin induction, compared with either IL-2 or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> induction (HR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Among persons with IgAN, recurrent disease occurred in 0, 7.3, and 3.7 percent with antithymocyte globulin, IL-2, and alemtuzumab induction, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with recurrent IgA generally present with persistent microscopic hematuria. New or worsening proteinuria or, occasionally, an increase in the serum creatinine may also be seen. In one study that included 42 patients with recurrent IgAN, the following clinical presentations were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated microscopic hematuria (5 patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated proteinuria (8 patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopic hematuria plus proteinuria (12 patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated increase in serum creatinine (4 patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased creatinine with either hematuria or proteinuria (13 patients)</p><p/><p>If IgAN recurs, the time to onset of clinical manifestations due to renal IgA deposition varies. In one study of 61 transplant recipients with initial kidney loss due to IgAN (of whom 18 had recurrent disease), the mean time to clinical recurrence and allograft failure was 31 and 63 months, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Occasionally, patients may develop early graft failure associated with crescentic IgAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/20,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,36,37</a>].</p><p>Patients who had a rapidly progressive course to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the native kidney tend to present early after transplantation with clinically significant recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/8,9,15,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,15,38</a>]. Thus, patients with a rapidly progressive course of IgAN in their native kidneys should be informed that recurrent disease in the transplanted kidney may manifest early.</p><p>Similarly, patients with early graft loss from recurrent IgAN may have rapid recurrence of clinically significant disease following repeat transplantation; however, this is not certain, and good long-term outcomes have been described among such patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>While persistent microscopic hematuria in a patient with IgAN is likely secondary to recurrent disease, this should not be assumed, and other potential etiologies should be investigated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96093912\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent IgAN should be suspected among patients who have a history of IgAN and who present with hematuria, new or worsening proteinuria, or an increased creatinine. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. The indications for biopsy vary among clinicians. All agree that, among transplant recipients with a history of IgAN, the following are indications for a transplant biopsy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevated creatinine above baseline, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant proteinuria (defined as &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> despite an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent hematuria in the setting of a negative urologic evaluation</p><p/><p>Some clinicians would also biopsy patients who present with isolated, persistent, low-grade proteinuria (defined as &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> regardless of the absence or presence of an ACEI or ARB, whereas others would not perform a biopsy for such patients, providing the creatinine remained stable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that all patients with recurrent IgAN be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Treatment with an ACEI or ARB may delay progression of recurrent disease in allografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p>We suggest that all patients with IgAN of the native kidney and hypertension be treated with an ACEI or ARB, even in the absence of any evidence of recurrent disease.</p><p>We suggest that patients who had IgAN of the native kidneys, but who have no evidence of recurrence and do not have hypertension, not be treated with ACEI or ARB. It is not known whether early posttransplant initiation of these agents to all recipients with native IgAN, independent of disease recurrence, is beneficial.</p><p>Most studies that examined the benefit of ACEI therapy among patients with IgAN have included only nontransplant patients. These studies are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of IgA nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are limited data on the benefit of ACEIs or ARBs among transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. The best data are from a retrospective review of 75 transplant recipients with known IgAN of the native kidney, which demonstrated a higher 5- and 10-year graft survival associated with the use of ACEIs or ARBs, but this was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Among patients with biopsy-proven recurrence, of those on an ACEI or ARB, three of nine progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Among four patients with biopsy-proven IGAN who were not being treated with an ACEI or ARB, all progressed to ESRD.</p><p>It is not clear that graft survival is actually improved by initiating either an ACEI or an ARB following the detection of recurrent IgAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>There have also been case reports of fish oil having a favorable effect in recurrent IgAN, but no studies have been performed to support its routine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The optimal immunosuppressive therapy for recurrent IgAN is not known, and the approach is derived from studies of IgAN in the native kidney. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of IgA nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Immunosuppressive therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Among such patients, high-dose glucocorticoids (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> may be given for two months, followed by a slow taper back to low doses commonly used to prevent rejection.</p><p>Patients who have a rapidly increasing serum creatinine despite high-dose glucocorticoids may benefit from oral or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, based upon studies of patients with IgAN in the native kidney.

However, pretransplant tonsillectomy on patients with IgAN does not appear to prevent disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].<br/></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96089893\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the lack of a prospective study involving protocol biopsies, the true risk of significant graft dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> graft loss from recurrent disease is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/5-10,15,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10,15,45</a>]. </p><p>Historically, it was thought that, despite the risk of recurrent disease, among patients with a history of IgAN, the overall graft survival was similar to that of patients with a history of non-IgA glomerular or nonglomerular disease. As an example, in a large retrospective analysis (532 allograft recipients with primary IgAN) from Australia, the estimated 10-year incidence of graft loss due to recurrent disease was 9.7 percent (95% CI 4.7-19.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Allografts in IgAN recipients exhibited a similar 10-year survival as allografts in recipients with either non-IgA glomerular or nonglomerular disease. In this series, recurrent IgAN was a less frequent cause of graft loss than either chronic rejection or death with a functioning graft. The risk of graft loss in relation to donor source was not evaluated.</p><p>However, more recent data provide further information on the long-term allograft survival of patients with IgAN. One group reported that allograft survival beyond 12 years was lower for patients with IgAN, compared with non-IgAN patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Another study that examined 15-year outcomes reported that death-censored graft survival was lower among patients with recurrent IgAN, compared with controls (62.6 versus 72.4 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Further studies that examine long-term allograft survival among patients with IgAN are expected to further clarify this issue.</p><p>Recurrent IgAN in combination with chronic rejection has a worse prognosis, compared with recurrent IgAN alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>There are only a few studies that have examined outcomes of a second transplant after the first was lost to recurrent IgAN. However, good long-term function has been described, despite evidence of IgA deposition in the second allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/8,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H96090738\"><span class=\"h2\">Markers for progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with all glomerulopathies, increased urinary protein excretion and increased sclerosis and fibrosis on renal biopsy with IgAN are associated with an enhanced risk of progressive disease. In one study of recurrent IgAN, for example, urine protein excretion &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and biopsy findings of prominent glomerulosclerosis (involving &gt;30 percent of glomeruli) were associated with universal graft loss by six years after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. By comparison, urinary excretion &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> and a renal biopsy in which &lt;10 percent of glomeruli show glomerulosclerosis forecast stable allograft function at nine years posttransplantation.

A review of 41 renal transplant recipients with primary IgAN found a higher prevalence of persistent microscopic hematuria, compared with recipients with other native renal disease (32 versus 12 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Although it would be rare for a patient to have graft dysfunction as a result of IgA deposition in this setting, given the incidence of celiac disease in the general population, particularly in diabetics, it is reasonable to screen patients with recurrent IgAN for celiac disease, especially those with otherwise unexplained diarrhea, malabsorption, or iron deficiency.

In one study of 70 living-donor kidney biopsies obtained just prior to transplantation, 13 percent had glomerular IgA deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Another report described the presence of latent mesangial IgA deposits in approximately 16 percent of biopsies obtained at the time of transplantation from both living and deceased donors otherwise considered healthy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Graft outcomes were not reported in either of these analyses.</p><p>A prospective analysis of 83 recipients of deceased-donor allografts with IgA deposition reported an increased incidence of early acute rejection (31 versus 19 percent), delayed graft function, proteinuria, and hematuria, compared with 259 recipients of a deceased-donor allograft without evidence of IgA deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Serial protocol biopsies tended to demonstrate gradual resolution of IgA deposition within 45 days following transplantation, as well as resolution of the proteinuria and hematuria. Despite the increased incidence of acute rejection and clinical signs of allograft dysfunction, graft survival at one and three years was similar in both groups.</p><p>Two other series with a total of 12 patients noted rapid resolution of IgA deposits after transplantation in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iga-nephropathy-recurrence-after-transplantation/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. At present, our practice is <strong>not</strong> to use kidneys with known IgA deposits for donation. However, we have unknowingly transplanted deceased-donor allografts with evidence of IgA deposition evident on an early posttransplant biopsy that has resolved on follow-up biopsy with no evidence for adverse outcome on graft function or survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is caused by the deposition of IgA in the kidney parenchyma. IgAN may cause progressive renal dysfunction. Transplantation is the treatment of choice for individuals with progressive renal failure. Recurrent IgA deposition in the allograft is common and may cause hematuria, proteinuria, or progressive renal dysfunction. Among some patients, however, IgA deposits are observed on biopsy, but do not appear to cause clinically significant disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of recurrence may be higher among recipients of living-related-donor kidneys, compared with deceased-donor kidneys. However, there is <strong>no</strong> basis for avoiding a living-related-donor source, largely due to the reported equivalence of graft survival independent of IgAN recurrence, but also given the expected deceased-donor waiting-list time and a reported decrease in patient mortality and increase in graft survival with earlier transplantation in relation to time on dialysis.<br/><br/>Other possible risk factors for recurrence include specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles among recipients, a close HLA match between donor and recipient, and increased serum IgA concentrations among recipients. However, none of these risk factors have been validated. (See <a href=\"#H96090233\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of recurrent IgAN is made by biopsy. Indications for a transplant biopsy include an elevated creatinine above baseline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> significant proteinuria (defined as &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> despite an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent hematuria in the setting of a negative urologic evaluation. Some clinicians would also biopsy patients who present with isolated, persistent, low-grade proteinuria (defined as &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> regardless of the absence or presence of an ACEI or ARB, whereas others would not perform a biopsy for such patients, providing the creatinine remained stable. (See <a href=\"#H96093912\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no known preventive therapy for IgAN recurrence. There are no conclusive data that the selection of immunosuppressive therapy alters the risk of recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H96093778\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generally, all patients with recurrent IgAN are treated with ACEIs or ARBs, which may delay progression of recurrent disease in allografts. Patients with IgAN of the native kidney and hypertension are treated with an ACEI or ARB, even in the absence of any evidence of recurrent disease, although patients who had IgAN of the native kidney, but who have no evidence of recurrence and do not have hypertension, are generally not treated with ACEIs or ARBs. It is not known whether early posttransplant initiation of these agents to all recipients with native IgAN, independent of disease recurrence, is beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppressive therapy specifically directed toward treatment of recurrent IgA may be used in selected patients, such as those with biopsy-proven recurrence and rapidly rising serum creatinine or nephrotic-range proteinuria despite the use of ACEIs or ARBs. Among such patients, high-dose glucocorticoids (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) may be given for two months, followed by a slow taper back to low doses commonly used to prevent rejection. Patients who have a rapidly increasing serum creatinine despite high-dose glucocorticoids may benefit from oral or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, based upon studies of patients with IgAN in the native kidney. If cyclophosphamide is used, the current antimetabolite used to prevent rejection (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>) should be discontinued for the duration that the patient is on cyclophosphamide. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, the reported risk of graft loss due to recurrent disease is approximately 7 to 10 percent at 10 years, but the risk is probably higher than this as time from transplant increases. Among patients with graft dysfunction attributed to recurrent IgAN, the risk of graft loss is much higher. Increased urinary protein excretion and increased sclerosis and fibrosis on renal biopsy, but not isolated hematuria, are associated with an enhanced risk of progressive disease. (See <a href=\"#H96089893\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H96090738\" class=\"local\">'Markers for progression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura (IgA vasculitis [IgAV] or HSP), which has renal manifestations indistinguishable from IgAN, usually occurs in children, but has also been reported in adults.
