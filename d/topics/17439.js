In the United States, the approval of bevacizumab for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ushered in the modern era of antiangiogenic therapy. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted approval for bevacizumab in mCRC in January 2006. Subsequently, bevacizumab has been approved by the FDA for treatment of metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

Toxicities of antiangiogenic agents may be classified as VEGF class-specific, drug class-specific, or agent-specific. (See <a href=\"#H1651224889\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many of the adverse effects seen with angiogenesis inhibitors, particularly the cardiovascular effects and hemorrhage, are serious and potentially fatal. (See <a href=\"#H89432012\" class=\"local\">'Risk of fatality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful selection of patients for therapy with angiogenesis inhibitors (ie, reasonable performance status, controlled blood pressure, and lack of serious cardiovascular events within six months) as well as close monitoring and prompt intervention are necessary to alleviate the risks posed by these toxicities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All VEGF-targeted agents cause proteinuria, which is rarely nephrotic range (&gt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/24</span> hours), and even more rarely, associated with the nephrotic syndrome. The implications of asymptomatic proteinuria from VEGF inhibitors are unknown and it is possible that the vast majority of cases have no clinical consequences. However, baseline and periodic urinalysis should be performed during treatment with all of these agents. (See <a href=\"#H1651225341\" class=\"local\">'Proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All VEGF-targeted agents have been associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage. This is most commonly grade 1 epistaxis, serious, and in some cases, fatal hemorrhagic events, including hemoptysis (particularly in patients with squamous cell lung cancer), gastrointestinal bleeding, hematemesis, intracerebral hemorrhage, epistaxis, and vaginal bleeding, have occurred (risk of major bleeding approximately 2 to 3 percent). (See <a href=\"#H1651227378\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because of the risk of massive hemoptysis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> is contraindicated in patients with squamous cell lung carcinoma and in any patient with hemoptysis (&gt;2.5 mL of blood) within three months. (See <a href=\"#H1651227415\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary hemorrhage and cavitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk of intracranial bleeding is low, even in patients with nonhemorrhagic brain metastases and recurrent gliomas. Patients with a history of treated nonhemorrhagic brain metastases or a recurrent primary brain tumor need not be excluded from systemic therapy with a VEGF inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H1651227407\" class=\"local\">'Intracranial bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bevacizumab</a> and antiangiogenic TKIs have been associated with impaired wound healing in a variety of settings. At least 28 days (preferably six to eight weeks) should elapse between surgery and last dose of bevacizumab, except when clinically necessary. (See <a href=\"#H1651227437\" class=\"local\">'Bevacizumab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the clinical situation permits, antiangiogenic TKIs should be interrupted for at least one week before surgery and not reinitiated until adequate wound healing has occurred, usually at least two to four weeks after major surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1651227444\" class=\"local\">'Antiangiogenic TKIs'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although best described with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, all VEGF targeted therapies can cause gastrointestinal perforation (GIP) leading to peritonitis, fistula formation, or intraabdominal abscess. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for GIP in patients who develop acute abdominal pain while receiving bevacizumab or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramucirumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramucirumab</a>, even if they have no apparent risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H1651227451\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal perforation/fistula formation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are isolated case reports of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in patients treated with VEGF inhibitors, mostly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a>, but the overall incidence appears to be low.
