Doctors recommend that women breastfeed their babies for at least 1 year (12 months) when possible. For the first 6 months, breast milk is the only food a baby needs. After 6 months, doctors recommend that women still breastfeed. But babies can start eating and drinking other foods, too.</p><p>Some women choose not to breastfeed. They might think that it is easier to feed a baby formula. Or they might be embarrassed to breastfeed.</p><p>But breastfeeding has many benefits for both the mother and baby, even if a woman breastfeeds for only a short time. Also, these benefits can last even after the breastfeeding has stopped.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9660572\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits for babies?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breastfeeding can keep babies from getting stomach infections that can cause vomiting or diarrhea. It can also keep babies from getting ear or lung infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9660579\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits for women?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breastfeeding can benefit women in many ways. Compared with women who feed their babies formula, women who breastfeed usually:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have less bleeding from the uterus after giving birth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have less stress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose more weight after pregnancy (if they breastfeed at least 6 months)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a lower chance of getting breast, ovarian, or endometrial (uterine) cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Don't spend as much money to feed their baby</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Don't spend as much money on healthcare or miss as much work, because their babies get sick less often</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9660586\"><span class=\"h1\">How do the breasts make milk?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast milk is made by the &quot;milk glands&quot; in the breasts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72583\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72583 \">figure 1</a>). During pregnancy, these glands get ready to make breast milk.</p><p>After a woman gives birth, substances in her body called &quot;hormones&quot; cause the breasts to fill with milk. For the first few days after birth, women make only a small amount of yellowish milk called &quot;colostrum.&quot; Colostrum has all of the nutrition a newborn needs. Women start making more breast milk a few days later, usually 2 to 3 days after giving birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9660593\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I make enough milk?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most healthy women can make enough breast milk. Each time a baby feeds and empties the breasts, the body makes more milk. After 2 to 4 weeks of breastfeeding, most healthy women make about 3 cups of milk a day.</p><p>Sometimes, women can have trouble making enough milk. This can happen if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are tired or sick</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a lot of stress </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take certain medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoke cigarettes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not breastfeed often enough</p><p/><p>If you have trouble making enough milk, talk with your doctor or nurse. Some women also find it helpful to work with a breastfeeding expert called a &quot;lactation consultant.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9660600\"><span class=\"h1\">When can I start breastfeeding?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women can start breastfeeding in the delivery room. Women should start breastfeeding within the first few hours of giving birth. During this time, most babies are awake and want to breastfeed.</p><p>If you can't be with your baby right after birth, there are things you can do so that you can still breastfeed. You can use a device called a breast pump to collect breast milk that your baby can drink later. Using a breast pump also helps the breasts continue to make milk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9660607\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I breastfeed if I had breast surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you had breast surgery, you can try to breastfeed and see if you make enough milk. Many women who had surgery to make their breasts smaller or bigger can make enough milk, but some can't.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9660614\"><span class=\"h1\">When is breastfeeding not recommended?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors do not recommend breastfeeding if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an infection, such as the HIV virus, that the baby can catch by breastfeeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are getting treated for cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use certain illegal drugs or drinks too much alcohol</p><p/><p>Also, doctors do not recommend breastfeeding for babies who are born with a medical condition called &quot;galactosemia.&quot; Talk to your doctor or nurse if you're not sure if you should breastfeed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9660621\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to do anything or buy anything to get ready?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women do not need to do anything or buy anything to get ready for breastfeeding. But some women buy or rent a breast pump later on. A woman can use a breast pump for times when she is at work or away from her baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9660628\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have questions about breastfeeding?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have questions about breastfeeding, ask your doctor or nurse. You might also find it helpful to talk to a breastfeeding expert called a &quot;lactation consultant.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9660785\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breastfeeding (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breastfeeding-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common breastfeeding problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=health-and-nutrition-for-women-who-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Health and nutrition for women who breastfeed (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pumping-breast-milk-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pumping breast milk (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weaning-from-breastfeeding-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weaning from breastfeeding (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breastfeeding-guide-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breastfeeding guide (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
