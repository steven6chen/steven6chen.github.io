A minority of patients with this disorder may survive untreated for many years. However, more frequently, MCL assumes a more virulent character, akin to that of an aggressive NHL variant.</p><p>There is great variability in the initial treatment of MCL used in clinical practice. While some advocate intensive chemotherapy with autologous transplantation, others prefer combination chemotherapy regimens used for aggressive NHL subtypes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite all efforts to the contrary, therapy for MCL is not curative and virtually all patients will have refractory or recurrent disease. Treatment of recurrent MCL is difficult, due to the rapid development of chemotherapy resistance. There are multiple chemotherapy regimens that may be tried and clinical practice varies greatly by center. Given the limited efficacy of these agents and paucity of data comparing these various treatment options, participation in a clinical trial is encouraged whenever possible.</p><p>The treatment of relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma will be discussed here. The initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma and the clinical and pathologic features of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H492537831\"><span class=\"h1\">GOALS OF CARE AND APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the possible exception of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), available therapies for relapsed or refractory MCL are not curative and the goal of treatment is to prolong progression-free survival and palliate symptoms. Most patients with relapsed disease are offered treatment with a salvage regimen. If chemosensitivity is shown, young patients without significant comorbid disease may benefit from high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support or allogeneic HCT. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Hematopoietic cell transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEMOTHERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of treatment regimens have been evaluated in patients with recurrent or refractory MCL, with variable success. Some of these agents are undergoing further investigation for use in combination therapies. We encourage patients to participate in clinical trials whenever available. (See <a href=\"#H90400620\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.)</p><p>Most patients with MCL experience serial relapse and may be treated with many available agents at some point during their disease course. A preferred order for their use has not been established. A choice is primarily made based on the patient's prior treatment, patient comorbidities and performance status, the regimens' expected toxicities, and the clinician's experience with the regimens. Most of these regimens have not been compared directly in randomized trials.</p><p>Potential salvage regimens include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibrutinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ibrutinib</a> &ndash; Ibrutinib is an oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that is relatively well tolerated.

Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neuropathy, thrombosis, and teratogenicity are the major toxicities.

As an example, BR (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) results in response rates &gt;75 percent in patients with relapse following initial treatment with R-CHOP. However, given the increased use of BR in the initial management of MCL, the number of patients that are candidates for this approach is small. The response rate to R-CHOP following BR is not well established. In the previously untreated population, R-CHOP is more toxic than BR but results in similar response rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Rituximab as a single agent has limited activity but is relatively well tolerated; we would use single agent rituximab only for the small group of patients who got significant benefit from initial therapy with single agent rituximab and whose co-morbidities might limit use of other agents.

Studies have also evaluated its use in the setting of relapsed and resistant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/66-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-71</a>]. Although autologous HCT does not appear to be curative, some patients may experience a prolonged remission. Median event-free survival after autologous HCT is approximately three years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-mantle-cell-lymphoma#H1967069\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of mantle cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Autologous transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>This was best illustrated in an analysis of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry that identified patients who had undergone autologous HCT in first partial or complete remission after one (134 patients) or two (115 patients) lines of chemotherapy, and compared their outcomes with those of 132 patients with chemotherapy-sensitive disease who had undergone autologous HCT at a later time in their disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Estimated rates of five-year survival were similar for those who attained a complete remission after one or two lines of chemotherapy (75 versus 70 percent), but were inferior for those who had only a partial response (38 percent). When compared with HCT at a later time, HCT in first partial or complete remission was associated with superior five-year survival (61 versus 44 percent).</p><p>These results suggest that autologous HCT in first complete remission is effective regardless of whether it requires one or two lines of chemotherapy to attain the remission. Outcomes are inferior for those who are unable to attain a complete remission and for those who undergo autologous HCT at the time of relapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonmyeloablative HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial results of nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT for relapsed or refractory MCL are promising, but longer follow-up is necessary before this becomes a standard approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/72-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-76</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 18 subjects with advanced recurrent MCL, 16 of whom had chemosensitive disease, were treated with nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

At a median follow-up of 33 months, three-year overall survival for patients with MCL was 45 percent. The rate of transplant-related mortality was 13 percent among all patients in the trial.

Approximately one-third had received a prior autologous HCT. At a median follow-up of 26 months, estimated one-year and three-year overall survival rates for patients with MCL were 60 and 40 percent, respectively. Progression-free survival at the same time points was 30 and 40 percent, respectively. Acute GVHD occurred in 20 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of the CIBMTR registry identified patients with chemotherapy-sensitive MCL who had undergone reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT in first partial or complete remission after no more than two prior lines of chemotherapy (50 patients) or at a later time point in their disease course (88 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-mantle-cell-lymphoma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT was associated with a non-relapse mortality rate of 17 to 25 percent.
