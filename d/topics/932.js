Calculators are available that predict mortality for patients with cirrhosis, using the MELD parameters, age, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-mortality-risk-in-postoperative-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Child-Pugh classification has been used to assess the risk of non-shunt operations in patients with cirrhosis. One to three points are assigned to each of five parameters (encephalopathy, ascites, bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time [PT] or international normalized ratio [INR]). Patients with a score of 5 or 6 have Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis (well-compensated cirrhosis), those with a score of 7 to 9 have Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis (significant functional compromise), and those with a score of 10 to 15 have Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis (decompensated cirrhosis).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessing surgical risk in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Child-Pugh classification'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was developed to predict short-term survival in patients awaiting liver transplant. The MELD score is increasingly used in other settings, including prediction of perioperative mortality in patients with cirrhosis who undergo non-transplant surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The MELD score is a continuous scale (with higher values representing more severe liver disease) based on a formula that assigns weights to the patient&rsquo;s serum bilirubin, creatinine, sodium, and INR. Multiple studies have evaluated the use of the MELD score for predicting postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. In general, a MELD score of 10 to 15 confers increased perioperative risk, and patients with MELD scores &gt;15 should not undergo elective surgery.

Cardiac surgery, abdominal surgery, and hepatic resection are all associated with increased postoperative mortality compared to more peripheral surgery, presumably due to greater reductions in hepatic blood flow. Less invasive approaches, such as laparoscopy rather than laparotomy, or endoscopic stenting or percutaneous biliary drainage rather than cholecystectomy, may reduce risk.

Other blood tests may be indicated, based on patient comorbidities. </p><p>Imaging may be warranted if cholecystitis, primary or metastatic cancer, or hepatic injury is suspected. Volumetric studies are helpful for estimating the size of the remnant liver after liver resection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1996686673\"><span class=\"h4\">Liver function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver biochemical and function tests are commonly called liver function tests (LFTs), though many of the tests are not direct measures of liver function, and these tests are not liver specific. LFTs include aminotransferases (most commonly ALT and AST), alkaline phosphatase, tests of synthetic function (ie, albumin and PT or INR), and bilirubin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-biochemical-tests-that-detect-injury-to-hepatocytes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver biochemical tests that detect injury to hepatocytes&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients without known liver disease</strong> &ndash; Routine screening with LFTs is not recommended; regardless, these tests are sometimes performed preoperatively. If the results are less than twice the normal range, it is reasonable to repeat the abnormal tests to make sure they are not increasing. If the results are greater than twice the normal range, or increasing, elective surgery should be postponed and the patient should be evaluated further. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessing surgical risk in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Patients in whom surgery is contraindicated'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with known liver disease</strong> &ndash; Serum aminotransferases are elevated in most liver diseases and in disorders that involve the liver (such as various infections, acute and chronic heart failure, and metastatic carcinoma). The highest elevations occur in disorders associated with extensive hepatocellular injury, such as acute viral hepatitis, ischemic hepatitis (shock liver), and acute drug- or toxin-induced liver injury, all of which are contraindications to elective surgery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Albumin, bilirubin, and PT are laboratory parameters included in the Child-Pugh classification of the severity of cirrhosis, and bilirubin, INR, sodium, and creatinine are parameters included in the MELD score.

Preoperative optimization should be individualized and approached by a multidisciplinary team. There is little evidence to support specific goals for preoperative care for these patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Encephalopathy </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Hepatic encephalopathy is a multifaceted disorder that may occur in chronic liver disease. Metabolic factors can contribute to encephalopathy, some of which may be modified by anesthetic management. Hypoxia, hypovolemia, alkalemia, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, and hyponatremia can all precipitate hepatic encephalopathy, and should be avoided in patients with liver disease. Sedatives (particularly benzodiazepines) can exacerbate hepatic encephalopathy, and in addition, encephalopathic patients are particularly sensitive to sedatives and hypnotics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H343907868\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for precipitating causes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematologic abnormalities </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Diminished hepatic function has both procoagulant and anticoagulant effects, resulting in rebalanced hemostasis. Patients with liver disease frequently have abnormalities in routine laboratory tests of coagulation, including prolongations of the PT, INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), along with mild thrombocytopenia and elevated D-dimer, especially when liver synthetic function is more significantly impaired and portal pressures are increased. However, these tests are very poor at predicting the risk of bleeding in individuals with liver disease because they only reflect changes in procoagulant factors. Prolongation of the INR may reflect instability of the hemostatic balance, but not hypo- or hypercoagulability in cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H61498865\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Effects of hepatic dysfunction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H61498782\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Laboratory abnormalities'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In anticipation of surgery for patients with liver disease and abnormal hemostatic laboratory tests, we administer vitamin K for patients with suspected deficiency (eg, patients with poor nutrition, cirrhosis, cholestatic disease, antibiotic use).

We <strong>do not</strong> routinely administer fresh frozen plasma to correct the INR.

Patients with cirrhosis typically have a hyperdynamic circulation with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and high cardiac output (CO). Cardiovascular abnormalities increase with worsening hepatic function, and up to 50 percent of patients with advanced cirrhosis have features of cardiac dysfunction. The term &quot;cirrhotic cardiomyopathy&quot; has been used to describe a condition including normal to increased cardiac output and contractility at rest, but a blunted response to pharmacologic, physiologic, or pathologic stress that may result in overt heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Perioperative intravenous (IV) fluids should be managed carefully to avoid volume overload. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with liver disease are as likely as age-matched controls to have coronary artery disease, but may not be symptomatic due to functional limitations associated with liver disease. Minimally invasive tests for coronary disease are commonly used to screen patients with two or more coronary risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-overview-of-complications-general-management-and-prognosis#H65799163\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Overview of complications, general management, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some forms of liver disease, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>] may be associated with an increased incidence of coronary artery disease and cardiac morbidity and mortality.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H69669989\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary and pre-primary prophylaxis against variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic approaches'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery#H362228968\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Beta blockers'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with portal hypertension may develop portopulmonary hypertension (PPHTN). Thus, cirrhotic patients undergoing major surgery should be screened preoperatively with resting echocardiography. Severe PPHTN is an indication for liver transplant, and elective surgery should be delayed until after transplant. These patients are at risk for right heart failure, and like other patients with pulmonary hypertension, are at increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portopulmonary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portopulmonary hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary hypertension'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H2328396332\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Surgical risk'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Anesthetic management for patients with pulmonary hypertension is discussed separately.

Those with massive ascites may not tolerate lying supine for induction of anesthesia, or during procedures performed under monitored anesthesia care or regional anesthesia. Patients with encephalopathy are at increased risk for pulmonary aspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with chronic liver disease and portal hypertension may develop hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). The pathogenic mechanisms for HPS have not been clearly delineated, but are thought to induce intrapulmonary vascular dilatations (IPVDs). IPVDs cause hypoxemia mostly via ventilation-perfusion mismatch and oxygen diffusion limitation and rarely via shunt. The etiology and pathogenesis of HPS is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatopulmonary-syndrome-in-adults-prevalence-causes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H19914480\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatopulmonary syndrome in adults: Prevalence, causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Etiologies and pathogenesis'</a>.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with mild to moderate HPS may be treated with supplemental oxygen, and may require high intraoperative inspired oxygen concentrations if they come to surgery. Patients with severe HPS are typically evaluated for liver transplant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatopulmonary-syndrome-in-adults-natural-history-treatment-and-outcomes#H19913348\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatopulmonary syndrome in adults: Natural history, treatment, and outcomes&quot;, section on 'Treatment and prognosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Portal hypertension </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Many of the complications of cirrhosis are the result of portal hypertension, which can result in formation of varices, circulatory, functional and biochemical abnormalities, and ascites. During abdominal surgery, goals of fluid administration should be to decrease pressure in the portal system to reduce bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H4186537116\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal dysfunction</strong> &mdash; Liver disease can cause a progressive decline in renal function, characterized by retention of sodium and free water, renal hypoperfusion, and decreased glomerular filtration, which can lead to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Renal dysfunction is an important risk factor for mortality, and serum creatinine is one of the parameters in the MELD score. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatorenal-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatorenal syndrome&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cirrhotic patients are also at high risk for more common causes of renal dysfunction, such as parenchymal renal disease, sepsis, nephrotoxicity, and hypovolemia. HRS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other potentially treatable causes must be ruled out since therapies differ. Unlike these other etiologies for renal dysfunction, the use of potent vasoconstrictors (eg, norepinephrine or vasopressin) may be beneficial for patients with liver disease related renal dysfunction or HRS. The perioperative management of liver disease related renal dysfunction includes monitoring urinary output, avoidance of hyperkalemia and acidosis, and limiting exposure to nephrotoxins such as aminoglycosides. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatorenal-syndrome#H97745174\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatorenal syndrome&quot;, section on 'Approach to therapy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrolyte abnormalities </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Hyponatremia develops slowly in patients with cirrhosis and parallels the progression of the disease. In general, serum sodium should not be corrected in these patients unless the serum sodium drops below 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> or neurologic symptoms develop. If hyponatremia needs to be corrected, it should be corrected slowly to avoid central pontine myelinolysis.

The decision is based on the severity of liver disease and systemic vasodilation, coexisting diseases of other organ systems, the type and duration of surgery, anticipated intraoperative blood loss, the need for intraoperative laboratory studies, and patient age. </p><p>The usefulness of central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and many clinicians have abandoned CVP monitoring in the setting of liver resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In our practice, we do not place a central venous catheter (CVC) exclusively for pressure monitoring, but may place a CVC for venous access, or for vasopressor administration.</p><p>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a sensitive cardiac monitor, but placement of the TEE probe may be of concern in patients with esophageal varices and coagulopathy, and the use of TEE in these patients should be individualized. However, the risk of complications and esophageal hemorrhage in patients with severe liver disease appears to be low. In two large retrospective studies of TEE use during liver transplant, the incidence of major gastroesophageal injury was &lt;0.86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In a small series of patients with esophageal varices, TEE universally aided in diagnosis and was not associated with bleeding complications, although transgastric views were avoided to minimize esophageal manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1881900285\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of anesthetic technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of anesthetic technique for patients with liver disease should be based on the surgical procedure and patient factors, similar to patients without liver disease. Neuraxial anesthesia, general anesthesia, and monitored anesthesia care may be options. Specific concerns include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuraxial anesthesia (ie, spinal or epidural) can cause systemic hypotension and reduced hepatic blood flow as a result of neuraxial block induced sympathectomy. Intravenous (IV) fluids and vasopressors are commonly administered to reverse such hypotension, but the literature on the effectiveness of vasopressors on hepatic blood flow in this setting is conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-liver-disease/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. High thoracic neuraxial block (ie, T5) may reduce hepatic blood flow, and this effect may not be reversed with vasopressors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuraxial anesthesia procedures are contraindicated in patients with severe coagulopathy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia because of increased risk of spinal epidural hematoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hepatic resection can cause new postoperative coagulopathy.

Blood loss depends partially on the extent of surgery; since the right lobe usually represents two-thirds of the liver mass, right lobe resection is associated with more extensive liver transection and blood loss. A preoperative blood type and screen should be performed. We usually crossmatch 2 to 4 units of packed red blood cells prior to the start of surgery. </p><p>We place two large-bore (18 or 16 gauge) intravenous (IV) catheters.

A strategy of restrictive fluid administration (with or without administration of vasodilators <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diuretics), referred to as &quot;low central venous pressure (CVP) anesthesia,&quot; has been suggested during these procedures to reduce blood loss. The goal is to lower the CVP during hepatic resection to reduce the pressure in hepatic and portal veins and the vena cava, which are often the sites of bleeding. In most studies, a CVP &lt;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 is used to define low CVP anesthesia, though CVCs are now rarely used intraoperatively to monitor volume status.

Accessing the portal vein may require multiple attempts, and the procedure may take several hours.</p><p>TIPS may be performed with monitored anesthesia care with sedation, or with general anesthesia. General anesthesia is preferred for patients who would rather be asleep, and for those who are unable to tolerate the supine position for the duration of the procedure. Since TIPS worsens encephalopathy, most patient who are scheduled for TIPS do not have significant encephalopathy. However, for patients with altered mental status, general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation may be preferred to reduce the risk of aspiration.</p><p>Important considerations for anesthesia include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIPS is usually performed for patients with severe or end stage liver disease, often with massive ascites.
