Thus, approximately nine nonfatal strokes or deaths were avoided for every 1000 early-treated patients. These effects were similar in the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation.

The reviewers concluded that starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (160 to 300 mg daily) within 48 hours of presumed ischemic stroke onset reduced the risk of early recurrent ischemic stroke without a major risk of early hemorrhagic complications and improved long-term outcome.

In the SOCRATES trial of over 13,000 subjects with acute ischemic stroke or TIA, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a> monotherapy was not significantly better than aspirin monotherapy (both started within 24 hours of symptom onset) for the 90-day composite endpoint of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-treatment-of-acute-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

On day one, all subjects in both groups received aspirin at a dose of 75 to 300 mg determined by the clinician. At 90 days, there was a significant reduction in all stroke for the clopidogrel plus aspirin group compared with the placebo plus aspirin group (8.2 versus 11.7 percent, absolute risk reduction 3.5 percent, hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.81). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was low in both treatment groups (0.3 percent in each).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Note that the results of the CHANCE trial are <strong>not</strong> generalizable to all patients with acute stroke or TIA, since the inclusion criteria selected for patients with high-risk TIA, defined as an ABCD<sup>2</sup> (for Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of symptoms, and Diabetes) score of &ge;4 (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of transient ischemic attack and minor ischemic stroke&quot;, section on 'Risk stratification'</a>), and excluded those with isolated sensory symptoms, isolated visual changes, or isolated dizziness or vertigo, and no evidence of acute infarction on neuroimaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-treatment-of-acute-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The Chinese population has higher rates of large artery intracranial atherosclerotic disease and lower rates of vascular risk factor control relative to other populations (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial large artery atherosclerosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>). Thus, it is uncertain how to apply the CHANCE trial results to other populations, including &quot;low-risk&quot; TIA, moderate or severe acute ischemic stroke (who may be at higher risk for hemorrhagic transformation with dual antiplatelet therapy), and populations outside of China.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a subgroup analysis of 2933 subjects in CHANCE who had genotyping for CYP2C19 genetic variants, the CYP2C19 *2 or *3 loss-of-function alleles were present in 59 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-treatment-of-acute-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

These findings suggest that the additional benefit of combined treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin for lowering stroke risk in this population is reduced or eliminated in carriers of CYP2C19 loss-of-function genotypes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-resistance-and-clopidogrel-treatment-failure#H620492189\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clopidogrel resistance and clopidogrel treatment failure&quot;, section on 'Loss of function gene carriers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2013 meta-analysis of early dual antiplatelet therapy versus monotherapy for patients with noncardioembolic acute ischemic stroke or TIA identified 14 trials with over 9000 adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-treatment-of-acute-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The meta-analysis included patients from the CHANCE, EARLY, and FASTER trials, who were all enrolled within 24 hours of onset, and those patients from secondary prevention trials who were enrolled within 72 hours of symptom onset. Treatments involved several different combinations of dual antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, aspirin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a>, aspirin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cilostazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cilostazol</a>) and three different monotherapy regimens (aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole). Compared with monotherapy, dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with a statistically significant reduction in recurrent stroke (relative risk [RR] 0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.80) and composite vascular events and death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.63-0.81) and with a nonsignificant increase in major bleeding (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.70-2.59). The strength of these findings is limited by multiple issues including variability among trials regarding patient populations, antiplatelet medications, and length of follow-up, the inclusion of patient subgroups that enrolled early in secondary prevention trials, the open-label design of seven of the included trials, the lack of intention-to-treat analysis of five trials, and small event numbers for certain outcomes such as intracerebral hemorrhage and death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TARDIS trial enrolled over 3000 patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA and compared triple antiplatelet therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a> versus either clopidogrel alone or aspirin and dipyridamole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-treatment-of-acute-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-cerebral-and-cervical-artery-dissection-treatment-and-prognosis#H28007410\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous cerebral and cervical artery dissection: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Antithrombotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with acute cardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA who have intracardiac thrombus, either in the left ventricle or associated with mechanical or native heart valves, we suggest early parenteral anticoagulation rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This approach is controversial. Other experts favor early treatment with aspirin rather than anticoagulation in this setting for patients with an infarct. Our suggestion to use early parenteral anticoagulation for these selected patients applies only to those with a small brain infarct or TIA and no evidence of hemorrhage on brain imaging. (See <a href=\"#H1180709\" class=\"local\">'Role of early anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522151776\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Walter J Koroshetz, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-treatment-of-acute-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">The International Stroke Trial (IST): a randomised trial of aspirin, subcutaneous heparin, both, or neither among 19435 patients with acute ischaemic stroke.
