It is secreted in response to hypocalcemia and few other stimuli into the systemic circulation. It exerts its effects through the interaction of its first 34 amino acids with the type 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">PTH/PTH-related</span> peptide (PTHrP) receptor (PTHR1). PTH fragments, containing carboxyl (C)- or amino (N)-terminal portions of the molecule that arise from either intraglandular or peripheral degradation of the hormone are also present in the circulation, but their biological significance remains to be defined.</p><p>PTH(1-84) has a plasma half-life of two to four minutes. In comparison, the C-terminal fragments, which are cleared principally by the kidney, have a half-life that is 5 to 10 times longer. As a result, circulating immunoreactive PTH in normocalcemic subjects comprises:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PTH(1-84) &ndash; 5 to 30 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C-terminal fragments &ndash; 70 to 95 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>N-terminal fragments &ndash; A small percentage</p><p/><p>Evidence suggests that some of these fragments, particularly the N-terminally truncated fragment PTH(7-84) (also referred to as non-PTH[1-84]), interact with distinct receptors (C-PTH receptor [C-PTHR]), and they may have roles in the regulation of bone resorption and serum calcium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is therefore conceivable that quantification of different PTH fragments could add to the diagnostic importance of PTH measurements.</p><p>PTH assays and their clinical use will be reviewed here. PTH physiology, receptor binding, and actions are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid hormone secretion and action&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PTH ASSAYS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radioimmunoassays for the detection of parathyroid hormone (PTH) are referred to as &quot;first&quot; generation assays; consequently, immunometric assays (IMAs) are referred to as &quot;second&quot; and &quot;third&quot; generation assays, respectively. The traditional second-generation assays (known as intact PTH assays) measure PTH(1-84) and large carboxyl (C)-terminal PTH fragments, whereas the third-generation assays (bioactive or biointact PTH assays) detect only PTH(1-84) and not C-terminal fragments. Some authorities refer to the IMAs as first-generation IMA (intact PTH assays) and second-generation IMA (bioactive or biointact PTH assays). Subsequently, another assay was developed with which oxidized (biologically inactive) and non-oxidized PTH (biologically fully active) can be differentiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, this latest assay relies on the ex vivo<em> </em>prevention of oxidation, which likely limits its clinical utility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Radioimmunoassays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PTH was first measured by radioimmunoassay using different polyclonal antibodies directed against epitopes that proved to be predominantly within the mid- or C-terminal portion of the PTH molecule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50424\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50424 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Such first-generation PTH assays therefore detected predominantly PTH fragments that lack an intact amino (N)-terminus, do not activate the <span class=\"nowrap\">PTH/PTH-related</span> peptide (PTHrP) receptor, and thus do not mediate the hormone's calcemic actions. Because of the crossreactivity with hormonal fragments and insufficient sensitivity, such assays have now been largely replaced by two-site IMAs, also referred to as &quot;sandwich&quot; assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunometric assays for the detection of PTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IMAs utilize two different antibodies that are directed against distinct epitopes within the PTH molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. One of these antibodies, directed against a region within the C-terminus, captures circulating PTH(1-84) as well as PTH fragments. The second antibody, directed against an N-terminal epitope, serves as the detection antibody, which can be radioiodinated, biotinylated for detection with enzyme-linked avidin, or tagged otherwise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50424\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50424 \">figure 1</a>). Radiolabeled detection antibodies have been replaced in most commercially available assays with a nonradioactively tagged antibody. IMA assays are intrinsically more sensitive and specific than radioimmunoassays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, they provide excellent sensitivity and specificity even for the diagnosis of mild forms of primary hyperparathyroidism. Furthermore, in contrast to the findings with radioimmunoassays, concentrations of PTH measured by IMAs are usually below the normal range in most patients with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy and with different forms of hypoparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], thus providing superior diagnostic utility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Intact PTH assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first widely used IMA two-site sandwich assays, also known as &quot;intact PTH&quot; assays, use a capture antibody against the C-terminal part of the PTH molecule (epitopes 39-84) and a radioiodinated detection antibody directed towards the N-terminal portion of PTH (epitopes 13-34) and, therefore, detect the intact as well as large C-terminal fragments that lack portions of the N-terminus (ie, the first 12 amino acids) and are termed non-PTH(1-84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Non-parathyroid hormone 1-84'</a> below.)</p><p>The detailed characterization of this intact PTH assay showed that the detection antibody interacts not only with human PTH(1-34) and PTH(2-34), but also with PTH fragments that are truncated further at the N-terminus, such as PTH(7-84) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50424\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50424 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The latter fragments (or variants thereof) are biologically inactive with regards to calcium-regulating activity, but some appear to inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and the formation of mature osteoclasts and, thus, may have indirect hypocalcemic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Bioactive PTH(1-84) assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subsequent IMA two-site assays use a similar capture antibody as the intact PTH assays but use detection antibodies directed against epitopes at the extreme N-terminal end (epitopes 1-4) of the molecule, and therefore, they were believed to detect exclusively the biologically active PTH(1-84) (whole PTH or bioactive PTH), but not non-PTH(1-84) fragments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50424\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50424 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/14,16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16-19</a>].</p><p>However, in a study comparing a radioimmunoassay with intact and bioactive PTH immunoassays in normal and hyperparathyroid subjects, the bioactive PTH assay reacted with PTH(1-84) and with another N-terminal PTH fragment, which is not recognized by the intact PTH assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The biological significance of this fragment, called N-terminal PTH form (N-PTH), is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'N-terminal PTH form'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3524673\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-oxidized PTH assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variant of the intact PTH assay has been developed to address oxidation of the methionine residues at positions 8 and 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This assay uses an immobilized monoclonal antibody raised against the oxidized peptide to extract this PTH variant from plasma. The remaining PTH is then measured by a two-site assay that uses antibodies directed against PTH(26-32) and PTH(55-64) for capture and detection. While potentially important clinically, ex vivo<em> </em>oxidation may be difficult to prevent reliably. (See <a href=\"#H827506\" class=\"local\">'Oxidized PTH'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12991203\"><span class=\"h3\">Assay variability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although second- and third-generation assays provide reliable measurements, thus allowing sound clinical interpretation, several variables have been proposed to affect PTH values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preanalytical factors include the inherent biologic variability in PTH levels due to hormone pulsatility and diurnal variation, choice of tube for sample collection, as well as sample stability at storage temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The stability of PTH when stored as serum or plasma EDTA samples at -80&deg;C is not indefinite. Depending upon the assay, the maximum storage times with either dry or EDTA plasma ranges from two months to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The purported greater stability of PTH when measured with a third-generation assay may be an added advantage, which has prompted some clinical chemistry laboratories to use third-generation assays instead of &quot;intact&quot; assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>]. Although the International Federation of Clinical Chemists (IFCC) PTH working group prefers plasma to serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], serum has the added advantage of allowing simultaneous measurements of calcium and PTH levels, an important consideration considering the substantial impact of calcium on PTH levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analytical factors include the presence of PTH fragments that can crossreact with the capture antibodies. Although capture antibodies in second-generation assays are usually in vast excess, accumulation of large PTH C-terminal fragments in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can theoretically affect measurement. Furthermore, N-terminal PTH fragments may interfere with intact PTH measurement in third-generation assays and the proportion of oxidized versus non-oxidized fragments can vary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postanalytical factors include the lack of a true normative range in individuals with normal renal function, who are vitamin D replete, and that is tailored to age and race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>], which may hamper interpretation and management of hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/23,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27-30</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition, there is currently no reference method for PTH measurement and no shared recombinant or synthetic PTH standard for the different PTH assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This results in large interassay variability in results obtained on the same samples when using PTH assays provided by different manufacturers and even when using same generation PTH assays that are produced by different manufacturers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. This finding underscores the importance of defining assay-specific normative ranges, particularly in certain populations (eg, CKD), monitoring patients with assays using the same <span class=\"nowrap\">laboratory/manufacturer,</span> and basing decisions regarding treatment upon trends rather than single laboratory values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/30,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33-35</a>].</p><p>IMAs, including the different PTH assays, are vulnerable to interference with heterophilic antibodies, which can be present in up to 11 percent of the population, that can bridge the capture and signal antibodies and cause a false-positive result. Such antibodies are increasingly prevalent because of the rise in the use of monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, cancer, and transplantation. Such antibodies were shown to cause substantial elevation in PTH levels in a 36-year-old woman with history of renal osteodystrophy, a functioning renal allograft, and PTH excess (3374 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> refractory to medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. She underwent a third parathyroidectomy, but PTH levels did not decline postoperatively, yet the patient developed severe hypocalcemia. Re-analysis of the patient's serum specimens was performed with heterophile-blocking agents to the murine-based immunoassay and revealed her true PTH level to be 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">PTH fragments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of circulating molecular forms of PTH have been identified by radioimmunoassays and IMAs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50424\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50424 \">figure 1</a>). C-terminal fragments (lacking small or large portions of the N-terminus) are most abundant, representing approximately 80 percent of circulating PTH in healthy individuals and approximately 95 percent in patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Large C-terminal fragments with a partially preserved N-terminus (referred to as non-PTH[1-84]) are secreted in vitro by parathyroid tissue from patients with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/13,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,38,39</a>].</p><p>An N-terminal form of PTH that is distinct from PTH(1-84) but detectable by bioactive PTH assays has also been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This form is secreted in vitro by parathyroid tissue from patients with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/12,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,40</a>]. In one report, a biologically active N-terminal PTH fragment (PTH[1-52]) was identified in the parathyroid adenoma of a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism, who had undetectable serum intact PTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Although not all of the large PTH fragments have yet been defined, PTH(7-84) appears to be a dominant form, and it may have hypocalcemic properties and may affect the activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maturation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-parathyroid hormone 1-84</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-PTH(1-84) fragments are a subset of large C-terminal fragments that lack only a small portion of the N-terminus and are therefore measured by the intact PTH assay. They differ from other C-terminal fragments that lack a large portion of the N-terminus and are not detected by the intact PTH assay. In individuals with normal renal function, non-PTH(1-84) fragments account for 10 percent of all C-terminal PTH fragments and for 20 percent of the PTH detected by the intact PTH assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In patients with CKD, such as in patients on hemodialysis, non-PTH(1-84) may account for as much as 45 percent of the immunoreactivity measured by the intact PTH assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The predominant non-PTH(1-84) isoform is PTH(7-84). PTH(7-84) does not bind efficiently to the type 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">PTH/PTHrP</span> receptor (PTHR1). Instead, it presumably exerts some of its biological effects through a receptor specific for the C-terminal portion of PTH (C-PTH receptor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/15,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,43</a>]. Such receptors have been detected in several different tissues and in clonal cell lines, including ROS <span class=\"nowrap\">17/2</span>.8 cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>]; the most abundant concentrations of this receptor were detected on osteocytic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. PTH(7-84), but not PTH(3-34) or PTHrP(7-36), inhibits basal 45Ca-release from pre-labeled calvarial bones. In addition, PTH(7-84) inhibits bone resorption induced by a variety of osteoclast-activating agents such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, prostaglandin E2, and interleukin (IL)-11 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Synthetic PTH(7-84) has been shown to have hypocalcemic properties when tested in vivo, as evidenced by its ability to block the calcemic actions of PTH(1-34) and PTH(1-84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/17,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,43</a>]. In addition, one study showed that PTH(7-84) decreased PTH-stimulated bone turnover in rats with moderate renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Thus, PTH(7-84) seems to exert effects that are the opposite of those of PTH(1-84). This may contribute to the skeletal resistance to PTH that is observed in patients with renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">N-terminal PTH form</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The existence of a modified form of PTH(1-84), referred to as N-terminal PTH (N-PTH), has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It differs from PTH(1-84) in that it is poorly reactive with antibodies directed against epitopes 12-18 used in most intact PTH assays. In contrast, N-PTH is detected with third-generation bioactive PTH assays (detection antibody requires amino acid residues 1 and 2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50424\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50424 \">figure 1</a>). In individuals with normal renal function, N-PTH accounts for 4 to 8 percent of PTH detected with a bioactive PTH assay, whereas it accounts for up to 15 percent in patients with renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. N-PTH appears to be overproduced in some forms of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and in parathyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/12,40,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,40,52</a>]. At the present time, its biological activity is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H827506\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxidized PTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with advanced CKD are subject to oxidative stress, and plasma proteins (including PTH) are targets for oxidants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In patients with CKD, a considerable but variable fraction (70 to 90 percent) of measured PTH appears to be oxidized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/2,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,54</a>]. Oxidized PTH does not interact with the PTH receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>], resulting in loss of biological activity. Intact and bioactive PTH assays detect both oxidized and non-oxidized PTH, resulting in higher PTH levels than when measured with a non-oxidized PTH assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The clinical utility of measuring only non-oxidized PTH remain uncertain, particularly because of concerns regarding ex vivo<em> </em>oxidation. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Secondary hyperparathyroidism'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE OF PTH ASSAYS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The realization that different circulating forms of parathyroid hormone (PTH) are detected by the various PTH assays has led to a reassessment of these assays in conditions of increased and decreased PTH secretion. Available evidence suggests that bioactive or whole PTH assays provide little additional information from that provided by intact PTH assays for the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. However, some data suggest that the newer assays may be superior in patients with renal failure, for intraoperative PTH monitoring, and for making the initial diagnosis in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and inappropriately &quot;normal&quot; serum PTH concentrations measured with intact PTH assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/14,16,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,57</a>]. Furthermore, bioactive PTH assays have been shown to improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with PTH carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary hyperparathyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intact PTH assays have been predominantly used for establishing the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. The results obtained with intact and bioactive PTH assays are highly correlated, and therefore, either intact or bioactive PTH assays can be used for diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. However, the clinician must be aware of the particular assay and normal values associated with its use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Serum PTH'</a>.)</p><p>Direct comparison of the two immunometric PTH assays, the intact PTH assay for combined measurement of PTH(1-84) and non-PTH(1-84) and the bioactive PTH assay for the measurement of PTH(1-84) and N-terminal PTH, revealed an excellent correlation (r = 0.922) in 165 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

However, when using bioactive assays, overlap exists in the upper end of the normal range between individuals considered to be healthy and patients with surgically proven hyperparathyroidism. Although limited data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] suggest that PTH is increased in a higher proportion of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism when using the bioactive PTH assay, several other studies have found no improvement in diagnostic utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p>The performance of bioactive PTH assays in patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism requires further elucidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraoperative PTH assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is now frequently used intraoperatively to confirm that an adenoma has been successfully removed; this technique is used particularly during less invasive procedures involving limited neck exploration after preoperative localization of the putative adenoma. Currently, most available rapid intraoperative assays are intact PTH assays measuring both PTH(1-84) and PTH(7-84), but it is conceivable that a third-generation rapid assay measuring bioactive PTH may be more useful for monitoring during parathyroidectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative localization for parathyroid surgery in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-exploration-for-primary-hyperparathyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Measurement of PTH levels in 74 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, which were performed in samples obtained 5, 10, and 15 minutes after excision of the adenoma, revealed that PTH, as measured with a bioactive assay, decreased faster after excision than when measured with the intact assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. At five minutes, PTH levels had dropped to less than 50 percent of the level before parathyroidectomy in all patients using the bioactive assay but remained above that cut-off in six patients (8 percent) using the intact assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary hyperparathyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), PTH concentrations are often measured to diagnose and monitor renal bone disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Mineral and bone disorders (MBD)'</a>). Although there is an excellent correlation between intact and bioactive PTH assays (r = 0.923 to 0.977) in patients with CKD on maintenance dialysis, mean PTH levels are typically approximately 30 to 50 percent lower when assessed by the bioactive assay compared with the intact assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/14,16,19,65-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,19,65-69</a>].

Oxidized PTH is less biologically active, as it does not stimulate the PTH receptor. The clinical utility of differentiating oxidized from non-oxidized PTH remains uncertain.

In patients with PHP type 1, there is diminished urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) excretion in response to exogenous PTH administration due to a deficiency in the proximal renal tubules of the alpha-subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gs-alpha) that couples to the PTH receptor (PTHR1).</p><p>There are several subtypes of PHP type 1 that are caused by heterozygous mutations within or up-stream of <em>GNAS</em>, the gene encoding Gs-alpha. PHP type 1A (PHP1A) is an autosomal-dominant disease caused by maternally inherited loss-of-function mutations involving <em>GNAS</em> exons 1 to 13 that lead to PTH-resistance in the proximal renal tubules, where Gs-alpha is derived predominantly from the maternal allele. Autosomal-dominant PHP type 1B (AD-PHP1B), on the other hand, is caused by microdeletions within or upstream of <em>GNAS</em> that are associated with the loss of methylation at one or several differentially methylated regions within <em>GNAS</em>. However, most PHP1B patients have a sporadic form of the disorder, which remains in most cases unresolved at the molecular level; in rare instances, it is caused by paternal uniparental isodisomy involving chromosome 20q. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypocalcemia-in-infants-and-children#H1308550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypocalcemia in infants and children&quot;, section on 'End-organ resistance to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism)'</a>.)</p><p>The ratio of non-PTH(1-84) to PTH(1-84) has been shown to be higher in patients with PHP1A and PHP1B than in 53 healthy controls (0.56&plusmn;0.07 versus 0.30&plusmn;0.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], suggesting that non-PTH(1-84) fragments, which may be similar to PTH(7-84), could be sufficiently elevated to reduce the response of a target organ to PTH in this group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Given the putative hypocalcemic properties of PTH(7-84), it is thus conceivable that the accumulation of non-PTH(1-84) fragments contributes to the pathophysiology of PTH-resistant hypocalcemia in PHP. However, these observations require further investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H727421055\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoparathyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hypoparathyroidism usually have normal or low PTH levels despite hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. However, a small family has been described in which the three affected members were shown to have a homozygous <em>R25C</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-assays-and-their-clinical-use/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. These patients had normal or low PTH levels when measurements were performed with a second-generation assay that uses a detection antibody that was affinity purified with immobilized 13-34; in contrast, very high PTH levels were detected when using a third-generation assay that uses a detection antibody that was affinity purified with immobilized 1-3. Although mutations in the secreted PTH are extremely rare, it is conceivable that some patients with hypocalcemia are misdiagnosed as being affected by pseudohypoparathyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radioimmunoassays for the measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) have been largely replaced by two-site immunometric assays (IMAs), which are the preferred method for PTH measurement today.
