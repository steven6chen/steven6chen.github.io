Juvenile systemic sclerosis (JSSc) is uncommon but has the most significant morbidity of the sclerotic disorders.</p><p>JSSc is a chronic, multisystem, connective tissue disorder characterized by symmetrical fibrous thickening and hardening of the skin combined with fibrous changes in internal organs, such as the esophagus, intestinal tract, heart, lungs, and kidneys. The extent of skin involvement and the accompanying pattern of internal organ involvement form the basis for the classification of systemic sclerosis in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of JSSc.

Other presenting complaints include arthralgia, muscle weakness and pain, subcutaneous calcification (calcinosis), dysphagia, and dyspnea.</p><p>This was illustrated in a multicenter, retrospective study of 153 children with JSSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The median age of onset was 8.1 years, and the mean duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 1.9 years. Almost 80 percent of the patients were girls. Eleven percent had a family history of autoimmune disease. Symptoms or findings at diagnosis were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Raynaud phenomenon &ndash; 70 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal skin induration &ndash; 63 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal symptoms (eg, arthralgia, muscle weakness, and arthritis) &ndash; 33 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss &ndash; 18 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea &ndash; 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysphagia &ndash; 10 percent</p><p/><p>Early JSSc may mimic juvenile polyarthritis as affected patients often present with swollen hands or feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74951\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74951 \">picture 1</a>). These symptoms may persist for weeks before skin changes as a result of sclerosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RP emerge.</p><p>Skin changes characteristically evolve in the following sequence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induration and edema, resulting in skin tightening and contractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrophy</p><p/><p>The duration of the first two phases varies, with edema usually occurring over months and induration lasting from three to five years. The residual atrophic phase persists as an integral part of the disease process.</p><p>During the atrophic phase, the skin becomes sclerotic (waxy in texture, tight, and hard) and bonds to subcutaneous structures. This is particularly noticeable over the digits and face, where the characteristic facial appearance may be the first clue to the diagnosis.</p><p>RP is often the presenting symptom. It may precede other manifestations by years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The classical Raynaud attack consists of three phases. The first represents the vasoconstriction, where the fingers turn white. This is followed by a bluish discoloration. Then, with the reperfusion, a reddish discoloration occurs. These findings primarily occur distal to the proximal interphalangeal joint on the fingers, and the thumbs are usually spared. RP is more common in the fingers but can be observed in the toes, ears, lips, tongue, and the tip of the nose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Musculoskeletal involvement is common and characteristically occurs at or near the onset of the disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthralgia is usually mild and transient. It is the presenting symptom in approximately 15 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint contractures are most common at the proximal interphalangeal joints and elbows.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis and myositis may occur in up to 30 percent of children and are characteristic of the overlapping manifestations that may precede a diagnosis of JSSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Myositis leads to muscle weakness and myalgia and is associated with elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK). Myocarditis may occur, and children with significantly elevated CK should be appropriately evaluated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periarticular and subcutaneous calcinosis may occur in one-fifth of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], whereas bone resorption is uncommon in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Telangiectasia is less commonly present in children than adults with JSSc (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72449\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72449 \">picture 2</a>). Nailfold capillary abnormalities are common. The periungual nailfold is the most accessible site for detection. Examination with an ophthalmoscope may demonstrate capillary dropout, tortuous dilated loops, and occasionally distorted capillary architecture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F94667\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94667 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79285\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79285 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Children rarely present with complaints of visceral organ involvement.

Large bowel involvement may present as alternating complaints of constipation and diarrhea, bloating, abdominal discomfort, or malabsorptive stools.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Radiologic and functional studies of the gastrointestinal tract often demonstrate abnormalities even in the absence of symptoms. Manometry and intraesophageal 24-hour pH monitoring are sensitive indicators of diminished lower esophageal sphincter tone and gastroesophageal reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Unlike adults, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, a devastating complication, is rarely reported in children with JSSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. Pulmonary vascular disease occurs either independently or as a result of pulmonary fibrosis in less than 4 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Screening tests for pulmonary disease in children with JSSc include chest radiograph, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and pulmonary function studies:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pulmonary function studies &ndash; Pulmonary diffusion (diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) and spirometry are sensitive measures of involvement of the respiratory tract and are used as a screening test for pulmonary disease in children with JSSc.

Cardiac fibrosis may lead to conduction defects, arrhythmias, and impaired ventricular function. Pericardial effusions are common but are not usually of hemodynamic significance. Isolated cardiac disease is rare. More frequently, cardiac and pulmonary involvement appear as one complex of organ involvement, where changes in one cause changes in the other. As an example, pulmonary hypertension caused by pulmonary vascular disease or fibrosis can lead to myocardial damage and right heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe cardiomyopathy, although rare, requires prompt and aggressive immunosuppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

In a case series of 153 children with systemic sclerosis, approximately 10 percent had renal involvement (such as proteinuria, hematuria, or progressive renal failure), but there was only one child with acute renal crisis, accelerated hypertension, and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although renal involvement in children may not be as severe as what is seen in adult patients, the abrupt onset of accelerated hypertension with acute renal failure (scleroderma renal crisis) is a severe and life-threatening complication.

Typical findings include fatigue, weight loss, rapidly advancing skin induration, arthritis, myositis, and tendonitis. Visceral involvement also commonly occurs during this period.</p><p>After the first five years of disease, constitutional symptoms often abate, skin abnormalities may stabilize or occasionally improve, but visceral involvement may progress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of JSSc in childhood is often delayed because of its rarity and the subtle initial manifestations. The diagnosis is established clinically by the presence of typical skin thickening and hardening (sclerosis) that is not confined to one area (ie, not localized scleroderma) and visceral involvement. The diagnosis is further supported by the presence of associated autoantibodies.</p><p>In 2007, a multicenter, multinational group representing the Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (PRES), the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) defined nomenclature and criteria to diagnosis and classify JSSc based upon clinical features and laboratory parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In a patient less than 16 years of age, JSSc is diagnosed if the major criterion and at least 2 of 20 minor criteria are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

According to these revised criteria, the presence of skin thickening of the fingers extending proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints is sufficient to classify the patient as having systemic sclerosis. In the absence of this sign, seven alternative criteria (ie, skin thickening of the fingers, fingertip lesions, telangiectasias, abnormal nailfold capillaries, interstitial lung disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), RP, and systemic sclerosis-related autoantibodies) are used to classify systemic sclerosis, with varying weight assigned to each of these findings. Patients with a score of &ge;9 are classified as having systemic sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These criteria may be applicable to JSSc patients, although some essential differences between the two age groups and the possible weak discrimination power with other pediatric conditions that enter in the differential diagnosis must be borne in mind.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests and pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although no laboratory test confirms the diagnosis of JSSc, the presence of autoantibodies is supportive.

Diagnosis is based upon documentation of nonpitting, indurated edema or stiffness of the skin in the typical locations. Dysphagia may be present, but Raynaud phenomenon (RP) and telangiectasias are not.

It gives an overall clinical evaluation based upon eight categories that correspond to the organ systems involved: vascular, cutaneous, osteoarticular, muscular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, cardiac, and renal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F95200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95200 \">table 4</a>). The parameters that are more sensitive to change are the body mass index (BMI) for general assessment and RP, number of digital scars, and number of <span class=\"nowrap\">ulcers/gangrene</span> for vascular involvement.</p><p>Skin induration is measured using the Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS) corrected for BMI and the Tanner stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment evaluation of adults with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;, section on 'Cutaneous'</a>). Osteoarticular involvement is assessed by evaluating for the presence of arthritis, limited range of motion in the joints, and tendon friction rubs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The childhood Myositis Activity Score (c-MAS) is used to assess muscle strength. Gastrointestinal involvement is monitored by evaluating for symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux, abnormal esophageal transit, and presence of malabsorption. The respiratory system should be given particular attention because abnormal respiratory signs often precede symptoms.</p><p>Pulmonary function tests such as FVC and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) should be frequently checked. In case of an abnormal result, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) should be measured by Doppler echocardiography, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest should be performed. To exclude cardiac involvement, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram should be checked, and, occasionally, Holter ECG and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are needed if arrhythmias are present. Renal involvement should be monitored by standard urine analyses and creatinine clearance with calculation of the glomerular filtration rate.</p><p>Two tools that measure patient function and quality of life have been validated for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and juvenile dermatomyositis: the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) and the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ-PF50). Although these two instruments appear to be excellent tools to measure clinical outcome in children with systemic sclerosis, especially in clinical trials, validation of these measures is required.</p><p>In adults, the response to treatment for RP can be assessed by <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/parents'</span> RP activity assessment, clinician RP activity assessment, RP frequency (number of attacks per week), and RP duration (mean duration of RP attacks per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Digital ulcers as a complication of RP or vasculitis can be evaluated by both digital ulcer count and pain. A prospective validation of these parameters in children is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1048307\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the prognosis of systemic sclerosis in children appears better than in adults. Survival rates for childhood-onset systemic sclerosis at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years after diagnosis are 89, 80 to 87, 74 to 87, and 69 to 82 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/11,22,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22,50</a>].</p><p>The commonest causes of death in children are related to the involvement of cardiac, renal, and pulmonary systems. Cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of early death, especially in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/21,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,50</a>]. This complication is rare and usually associated with diffuse cutaneous disease and features of polymyositis. An aggressive immunosuppressive treatment is effective on muscle, skin, and lung involvement but may not prevent progression of myocardial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) subset is considered a risk factor for higher mortality in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>] but does not appear so relevant in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Similarly, in another series, the presence of antitopoisomerase I and anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies and male gender were associated with poorer survival in adults, while no clear relationship was found between mortality and serologic features, age at onset, or gender in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with juvenile systemic sclerosis (JSSc) have a significant risk of severe morbidity and often have a poor prognosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>JSSc is characterized by symmetrical fibrous thickening and hardening of the skin combined with fibrous changes in internal organs, such as the esophagus, intestinal tract, heart, lungs, and kidneys.
