Muir-Torre syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes and is considered a phenotypic variant of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma syndrome (HNPCC, Lynch syndrome). Internal malignancies most frequently associated with Muir-Torre syndrome include colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, and urothelial cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muir-torre-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of Muir-Torre syndrome. Lynch syndrome is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-screening-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Screening and management&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253201803\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muir-Torre syndrome is caused by germline mutations in one allele of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes <em>MLH1</em>, <em>MSH2, </em>or<em> MSH6</em>. The MMR system consists of human mutS homolog 2 (hMSH2), human mutS homolog 3 (hMSH3), human mutS homolog 6 (hMSH6), human mutL homolog 1 (hMLH1), and human postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (hPMS2) proteins. They are responsible for maintaining the genomic integrity by correcting base substitution mismatches and small insertion-deletion mismatches generated by errors in base pairing during DNA replication. </p><p>Microsatellite instability (MSI) is the hallmark of MMR gene deficiency. Microsatellites are short repetitive DNA sequences, typically mononucleotide or dinucleotide tandem repeats, that are susceptible to mutations during DNA replication. The loss of DNA mismatch repair function due to germline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> somatic inactivating mutations of MMR genes leads to the accumulation of mutations across the genome and mainly in the microsatellite repetitive sequences, creating a molecular phenotype known as microsatellite instability. </p><p>Mutations in&nbsp;<em>MLH1</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>MSH2</em>&nbsp;have the most severe effect, producing a high-frequency MSI phenotype (MSI-H). An MSI-H phenotype can be demonstrated in nearly all cutaneous and visceral tumors from patients with Muir-Torre syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muir-torre-syndrome/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>In contrast with Lynch syndrome, in which germline mutations are almost equally distributed across all MMR genes, the majority of patients with Muir-Torre syndrome have mutations in <em>MSH2</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Mismatch repair genes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253201821\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muir-Torre syndrome is characterized by the association of at least one sebaceous skin tumor and at least one visceral malignancy. Sebaceous adenomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F98399\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98399 \">picture 1</a>), sebaceous carcinomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70403\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70403 \">picture 2</a>), and keratoacanthomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73408\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73408 \">picture 3</a>) are the most typical cutaneous tumors in patients with Muir-Torre syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muir-torre-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These tumors can precede, occur concurrently, or follow the diagnosis of internal malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-adnexal-tumors#H135421855\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous adnexal tumors&quot;, section on 'Tumors with sebaceous differentiation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sebaceous-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sebaceous carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keratoacanthoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keratoacanthoma: Epidemiology, risk factors, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sebaceous adenoma and sebaceous carcinoma present as yellowish or skin-colored papules, usually &lt;0.5 cm in diameter. They show a predilection for the head and neck region and particularly the periocular area in sporadic cases, whereas in patients with Muir-Torre syndrome these tumors are found predominantly on the trunk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muir-torre-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Because in over one-half of patients sebaceous tumors precede the development of internal malignancies, molecular testing of the skin tumor for mismatch repair (MMR) defects is critical to early diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muir-torre-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H253202019\" class=\"local\">'Tumor testing'</a> below.)</p><p>The presence of Fordyce spots (ectopic sebaceous glands) on the oral mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F69406%7EDERM%2F66778\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69406 graphicRef66778 \">picture 4A-B</a>) has been suggested as an additional clinical feature of Muir-Torre syndrome. In a study including 13 patients with Muir-Torre syndrome and confirmed germline MMR mutations and 140 healthy individuals, Fordyce spots were found in all patients with Muir-Torre syndrome but only in nine (6.4 percent) of the controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muir-torre-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Colorectal cancer is the most common visceral neoplasm associated with Muir-Torre syndrome. Compared with sporadic colorectal cancers, lesions are more often located in the proximal colon than in the distal colon, and develop 15 to 20 years earlier, with a median age of onset of 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muir-torre-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The second most common site of tumor development is the urogenital tract (endometrium, ovary, bladder, ureter, and kidney). Breast, pancreatic, gastric, lung, and hematologic cancers have also been reported in association with Muir-Torre syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muir-torre-syndrome/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253201949\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H253201955\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient is suspected to have Muir-Torre syndrome if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> has one or more of the following clinical criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muir-torre-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of one or more sebaceous tumors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age younger than 60 years at first presentation of sebaceous tumors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personal history of Lynch-related cancers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of Lynch-related cancers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H506714695\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Amsterdam criteria'</a>)</p><p/><p>In contrast with Lynch syndrome, for which the clinical diagnosis is based upon family history-based criteria and prediction models, the presence of specific skin neoplasms in Muir-Torre syndrome may lead to the correct diagnosis even in the absence of a clear family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/muir-torre-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In contrast, maintenance of expression of these proteins is associated with microsatellite instability in only 7 percent of cases. In cases in which MLH1 or MSH2 are expressed but the clinical suspicion of Muir-Torre syndrome persists, microsatellite instability analysis should be performed.
