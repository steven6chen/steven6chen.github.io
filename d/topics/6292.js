The prevalence of different renal lesions varies among the lymphoproliferative disorders. As an example, in a study of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (20 percent) was the most common renal lesion, followed by minimal change disease (10 percent), AL amyloidosis (7 percent), and light chain cast nephropathy (7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Kidney injury may also result from causes unrelated to monoclonal proteins.

As an example, infusion of monoclonal light chains from individual patients into mice produces the same form of kidney injury (cast nephropathy, amyloid deposition, or lack of disease) in the mouse as was seen in the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In vitro studies suggest that almost all toxic light chains, and a few of those that are nontoxic, are able to undergo self-association, leading to the formation of high-molecular-weight aggregates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These aggregates in vivo would then lead to cast formation in light chain cast nephropathy and tissue deposits with or without fibril formation in primary amyloidosis and light chain deposition disease (LCDD), respectively.</p><p>Additional light chain characteristics may be important in the determination of nephrotoxicity. Lambda light chains are found in roughly two-thirds of all (immunoglobulin light chain [AL]) amyloidosis, while nearly three-quarters of LCDD is caused by a monoclonal kappa light chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. In addition, specific lambda or kappa subtypes account for a large proportion of these renal diseases. Lambda VI accounts for greater than 40 percent of AL amyloidosis, while kappa I and IV are overrepresented in LCDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Finally, differential organ involvement in primary amyloidosis (AL) may be determined by the clonal sequence and germline donor patterns for the light chain variable region (immunoglobulin [Ig] V-lambda) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The properties of abnormal heavy chains are discussed elsewhere.

Light chains are freely filtered across the glomerulus and largely reabsorbed by proximal tubular cells. The normal rate of light chain excretion is &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.

A specific binding site for immunoglobulin light chains has been identified on uromodulin (THMP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This nine amino acid segment binds to the complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) of immunoglobulin light chains. Light chains with high affinity appear to be more likely to produce obstructing intratubular casts. However, light chains with only moderate affinity for uromodulin (THMP) may still induce cast formation if tubular concentration is increased by high serum concentration or hypovolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A competitive inhibitor peptide that prevents binding of light chains to uromodulin (THMP) decreases intratubular cast formation and prevents AKI in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Another contributing factor to uromodulin (THMP) binding and the predisposition to light chain cast nephropathy may be the isoelectric point (pI) of the light chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/2,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,35,36</a>]. Light chains (Bence Jones proteins) with a pI &gt;5.1 (that is, above the tubular fluid pH in the distal nephron) will have a net positive charge, which may promote binding via charge interaction to anionic uromodulin (THMP) (pI = 3.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/32,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36,37</a>]. Urinary alkalinization might be beneficial in some patients by reducing binding of the light chain to uromodulin (THMP), causing them to become less cationic, or even anionic, and by changing the charge on a single histidine residue in the binding site of uromodulin (THMP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/33,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36,37</a>].</p><p>Signaling molecules such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), and others have been implicated in cast formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/46-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H819625718\"><span class=\"h3\">Direct tubular toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intratubular cast formation is relatively minor in some patients; in such patients, the degree of renal failure correlates best with tubular damage and atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/43,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,52</a>].

A wide range of renal manifestations and pathologies involving different mechanisms have been described. Nearly all of the different types of kidney disease seen in multiple myeloma can also occur with B cell lymphoproliferative disorders and nonmalignant monoclonal gammopathies (ie, monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance).

The biochemical characteristics of the individual light or heavy chain appear to be a major determinant of which kidney disease (if any) occurs. Kidney injury may also result from causes unrelated to monoclonal proteins.

The diagnosis of light chain cast nephropathy is considered a &quot;myeloma-defining event&quot; and can occur as the first manifestation of myeloma or develop later during the course of myeloma.

In immunoglobulin-associated amyloidosis, the fibrils can be composed of monoclonal light chains (AL), heavy chains (AH), or both light and heavy chains (AHL). MIDD is pathogenetically similar to amyloidosis, except that the light (or heavy) chain fragments do not form fibrils, and the deposits are Congo red negative. Patients with amyloidosis and MIDD typically present with nephrotic syndrome and kidney impairment.
