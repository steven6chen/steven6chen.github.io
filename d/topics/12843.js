In addition, a review of 10 economically developed countries including the United States, United Kingdom, and Japan estimated that between 2 and 5 percent of older adults resided in nursing homes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. On average, nursing home residents stay in a long-term facility for more than two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately 25 percent of Americans die in nursing homes, and approximately one-half of these patients die within six months of placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Caring for these individuals presents many medical and health system challenges. Most long-term care residents are over age 65 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have multiple chronic health conditions affecting their cognitive and physical functioning. While some individuals in nursing homes return home after receiving therapy services, most will remain in a long-term care facility until their deaths. </p><p>This topic discusses the palliative care needs of individuals in long-term care settings and initiatives to improve nursing homes' palliative and end of life care services. While data specific to assisted living will be included, virtually all studies and programs have been conducted in nursing homes and this topic will therefore be most relevant to the nursing home population.</p><p>Other issues related to both palliative care and the general care of patients in nursing homes are discussed separately.

These needs include symptom management, care of the dying resident, support for family caregivers, assistance with decision making regarding diagnostic evaluations, and plans for if an acute illness were to happen (ie, wishes regarding transfer to an acute care facility).</p><p>In a national survey of bereaved family caregivers of nursing home residents, the following results were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 32 percent and 24 percent of their loved ones that had experienced either pain or dyspnea, respectively, did not receive enough help.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost 60 percent reported receiving inadequate emotional support during their loved ones' terminal illnesses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only 42 percent rated their loved one's quality of life in the nursing home as excellent, which was the lowest rating of all health care settings. In contrast, 71 percent gave an excellent rating to care delivered at home with hospice services.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2980588\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS, CARE NEEDS, AND CLINICAL COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most nursing home residents are older adults with significant physical and cognitive impairments. In the 2004 National Nursing Home survey, the nursing home population within the US was characterized as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 50 percent were over age 85</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than one-half were either totally dependent or required extensive assistance in bathing, dressing, toileting, and transferring</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-half of residents received nine or more routine<strong> </strong>medications </p><p/><p>In addition, nursing homes residents may have one or more chronic conditions that can limit their life expectancy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cause symptoms that add to their symptom burden, including cancer, congestive heart failure, chronic lung disease, diabetes, and arthritis. Between 1998 and 2008, the percentage of adults older than 85 years living with four or more chronic diseases (including those living in the community) almost doubled (from 14 to 24 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Based on this baseline risk and the increasing prevalence of these conditions (alone or in conjunction with other disease states), it is likely that the risk among those in nursing homes is higher.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715636482\"><span class=\"h2\">Dementia as a primary problem in nursing home residents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Though many individuals are admitted to long-term care facilities due to the effects of cognitive impairment, the prevalence of dementia among residents in long-term care facilities is uncertain. In one state survey, two-thirds of individuals in assisted living carried a diagnosis of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, the estimates on the prevalence dementia among nursing home residents range from 32 percent in the 2004 national nursing home survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] to 50 percent of individuals admitted to nursing homes in another state survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Despite this, caring for residents with dementia is perhaps the most challenging in terms of providing high quality palliative care as cognitive impairment complicates residents' ability to report symptoms and ultimately requires involvement of surrogate decision makers. </p><p>Dementia is an incurable and progressive condition, although this may not be initially recognized by family caregivers and nursing home staff. During the years they live in a nursing home, these residents frequently experience pneumonia, febrile episodes, and eating problems, particularly as the dementia becomes more advanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, individuals with dementia experience behavioral changes that may be challenging for long-term care staff to address, including resistance to care, agitation, and wandering. These behaviors may occur independently or develop as the manifestation of an underlying symptom or medical condition such as pain and infection. Management strategies for these behaviors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H883774\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPORTANCE OF ESTIMATING PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Though nursing home residents have multiple physical, cognitive, and functional comorbidities, health professionals should attempt to estimate residents' prognoses because this may influence decision making, including whether the burdens of a potential decision (eg, hospitalization for acute illness) outweigh the risks and whether a resident may meet hospice eligibility criteria. Prognostic indices have been published to estimate nursing home residents' six-month all-cause mortality risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and the one-year mortality risk of both newly admitted residents and residents who have lived in a nursing home for more than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These indices may be accessed using a website (<a href=\"http://eprognosis.ucsf.edu/&amp;token=FEE6F0JlRVF1b9TeuaII9KQd7CLxTAQWAQ1djW/ZYbXIC4LkjJFTXUWC0NEtoVA7&amp;TOPIC_ID=83652\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">eprognosis.ucsf.edu</a>) developed to provide evidence-based information on estimating older adults' prognosis in multiple care settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469808241\"><span class=\"h1\">LONGITUDINAL INTAKE OF THE NURSING HOME PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in nursing homes, structured interviews done at the initial intake and then at periodic intervals are necessary to ensure symptoms are being addressed and care goals are being met. These interviews also provide an opportunity to discuss hospice options for patients who are experiencing significant decline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> are approaching death. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469808411\"><span class=\"h2\">New nursing home patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all newly admitted patients to a nursing home, a comprehensive evaluation is required. This should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom assessment, with particular focus on cognition, pain, and constipation. (See <a href=\"#H25098883\" class=\"local\">'Specific symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication review, including questions to the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> their caregivers) regarding their effectiveness and side effects &ndash; This is important as polypharmacy issues may be an issue in the nursing home patient. (See <a href=\"#H469807546\" class=\"local\">'Polypharmacy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of existing advance care planning documents &ndash; For patients who have not completed advance care planning, assistance should be offered in completing this paperwork. For those patients who have not designated a surrogate decision maker, clinicians should directly inquire about who he or she would want to help make heath care decisions, which can help aide in the selection of a health care proxy. (See <a href=\"#H2980631\" class=\"local\">'Decision making'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss the patient&rsquo;s care goals &ndash; Recognizing the complexity of residents admitted to long-term care facilities, health professionals should seek to understand residents' primary goals and express a commitment to promoting consistency between residents&rsquo; care in the facility and his or her treatment preferences. Goals may include life prolongation independent of the resident's baseline function, promotion of functional and cognitive rehabilitation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enhancing the resident's comfort. If multiple goals are identified, patients and families should be counselled about prioritization of the stated goals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For example, while all residents should have symptoms assessed and treated as part of their care plan, some residents' may hold an exclusive focus on comfort without seeking to extend life or achieve functional gains as their highest priority goal. Estimating the resident's prognosis may assist in communication about care goals. (See <a href=\"#H469807679\" class=\"local\">'Goals of care communication'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2980588\" class=\"local\">'Patient characteristics, care needs, and clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469808418\"><span class=\"h2\">Established nursing home patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic assessments are required of all patients in nursing homes. This is particularly important for patients with progressively deteriorating illnesses, including advanced dementia and advanced malignancies. The evaluations should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodic symptom assessments &ndash; This may require sources other than the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> caregiver, including that of long-term care staff and family caregivers. This is particularly true for individuals with dementia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Semiannual review of medications &ndash; If long-term care residents experience functional and cognitive decline, medications that were beneficial may no longer be indicated and their continued use may pose side effect risks. Also, consider discontinuing medications based on the resident's care goals, prognosis, and other difficulties such as swallowing problems and perceived pill burden.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Annual review of advance care directives &ndash; Communicating about these directives helps ensure that care plans remain appropriate and enable changes to be made in response to changes in residents' condition and care goals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess condition and any anticipated changes in residents' condition &ndash; This communication relates to discussion of residents' care goals and advance directives and may inform decisions regarding tube feeding, hospitalization, and utilization of hospice services. For residents with dementia, these discussions may include when families may expect to observe behavioral changes, functional decline, feeding problems, and increased risk of infections. Consider estimating the resident's prognosis to help inform this communication. (See <a href=\"#H2980588\" class=\"local\">'Patient characteristics, care needs, and clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469807532\"><span class=\"h1\">ISSUES IN THE CARE OF THE NURSING HOME PATIENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25098883\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific symptoms</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25098909\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All United States nursing homes that receive federal funding must periodically report the percentage of residents reporting moderate to severe pain using the Minimum Data Set. These data are considered a quality of care measure that is reported for each nursing home on a publicly available website (<a href=\"http://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare&amp;token=5yvz7lCf0hefbc5ZhmpaTeeLWKGPIft/SbhtgvYA3O3hWasnHK76aO26pnZhMx5DPfWfjxgIYOewSg6FZqKDFQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=83652\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare</a>). </p><p>Untreated pain is a particular concern for patients in palliative care, and it appears to be an important issue for nursing home residents, especially those with cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimates are that up to 37 percent of nursing home residents report pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; it has been reported as excruciating in less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among residents who died in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, approximately one-half were reportedly in pain during the last month of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report suggested that more than 65 percent of newly admitted Medicare-eligible nursing home residents with cancer had pain, 28 percent daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Adequate analgesia was significantly negatively associated with age 85 and older (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.81), cognitive impairment (aOR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61-0.82), the presence of a feeding tube (aOR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.99), and use of restraints (aOR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31-0.82). </p><p/><p>For patients in the nursing home, pain may be related to osteoarthritis, neuropathy, or due to the chronic illness itself, especially cancer. As with patients receiving palliative care in other settings, it is important that attention be made to ensure adequate pain assessment and management. Assessment should include consideration of pain onset, location, duration, quality, severity, and both alleviating and exacerbating factors. A review of past management strategies and their effectiveness should also be completed. Pain management includes consideration of non-medication strategies (eg, massage, positioning, and music), non-opioid medications including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, anti-inflammatory, and neuropathic medications, and topical gels and patches. While there can be concern that use of opioid medications in older adults may be associated with delirium and other undesirable side effects, age alone should not be a contradiction to opioid use among residents in long-term care settings. Residents with moderate to severe pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> discomfort that does not respond to other therapies should be treated with opioids though the geriatrics prescribing principle of &ldquo;start low and go slow&rdquo; may be used. However, older adults may require and tolerate the same opioid dose as a younger patient. Residents' renal and hepatic function should also be considered when choosing and increasing opioid doses. Interventional approaches such as nerve blocks and radiation treatments may also be pursued. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25098935\"><span class=\"h4\">Assessing pain in patients with impaired cognitive function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior studies suggest that nursing home residents with dementia are less likely to receive pain medications than residents with normal cognitive function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Strategies for assessing pain in patients with severe cognitive impairment include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grimacing or guarding with movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agitation that is unrelated to movement </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New or worsening sleep disturbance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite </p><p/><p>For health care workers in the nursing home, the presence of dementia can result in challenges to pain assessment.

At the end of life the cumulative incidence of delirium is as high as 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss &ndash; Weight loss in this context is likely multi-factorial due to difficulties with oral intake, gastrointestinal distress, and deconditioning. However, while residents with weight loss may be asymptomatic, especially if expected as part of their dementia progression, nutritional decline can be distressing to family and staff caregivers.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469807539\"><span class=\"h2\">Cleanliness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As residents' functional status declines and death approaches, the ability to keep the patient clean becomes a more prevalent issue for the staff. In one study, staff reported that more than 90 percent of nursing home and 70 percent of assisting living residents had problems with cleanliness, including issues related to skin and oral care, as well as care required to manage incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469807546\"><span class=\"h2\">Polypharmacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While polypharmacy itself may not be considered a symptom, the volume of medications patients take on a daily or routine basis may adversely affect their appetite and contribute to nausea and constipation. A careful medication review should occur at the time of admission to a long-term care facility, with any significant change in health status, and as individuals are identified as entering an advanced or life-limiting stage of any incurable illness. In particular, over one-half of nursing home residents with advanced dementia receive medications of questionable benefit, including cholinesterase inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=memantine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">memantine</a>, and lipid-lowering agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Discontinuing these medications does not compromise outcomes, and may be associated with better quality of life. In one randomized trial conducted in patients with an estimated life expectancy of 1 to 12 months (22 percent had dementia), there was no increase in mortality 60 days after statin therapy was discontinued, and these patients experienced better quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of visitation by health care providers &ndash; Many physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants responsible for the care of nursing home patients and for writing orders make infrequent visits to the institution.

Infrequent nursing home visits can negatively impact the clinician's ability to develop collaborative care plans with nursing home staff and with the residents and their families. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of visitation by family caregivers &ndash; Caregivers may spend limited time in nursing homes, especially if they live at a distance or have other responsibilities. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High job turn-over of clinical staff &ndash; Nursing home staff tend to suffer from a high rate of job turnover, which in some facilities is greater than 100 percent annually. This is reflected in issues between staff and caregivers. In one study of residents who had died in long-term care, their family caregivers and facility staff differed on the residents' prognosis and symptom burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of education and training in palliative care &ndash; Staff report also receiving insufficient education and training on providing palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p/><p>In context of these factors, patients and their caregivers want contact with their clinicians. This was demonstrated in a national survey of bereaved caregivers whose family members died while in a nursing home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Almost one-third recalled wanting contact with their family member's clinician during the final phase of that person's illness, but they did not receive it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another similarly designed study, approximately one-half of bereaved caregivers felt they were not told what to expect during the dying process nor did they recall being a part of any conversation with the clinician about the residents' treatment preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. For patients with advanced dementia, families identify lack of communication with clinicians as a source of stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Some data indicate that increased clinician presence can improve familial certainty that the treatments being performed for their loved ones are appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Since involvement of nurse practitioners in caring for nursing home residents with dementia has been associated with high family satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], expanded collaborations between clinicians and nurse practitioners may enhance communication with nursing home staff, residents, and their families.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2980631\"><span class=\"h1\">DECISION MAKING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients in nursing homes should be included in any and all decision making as long as they have decisional capacity. An approach to the assessment of decision making capacity is covered in detail elsewhere, and summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F100356\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100356 \">table 3</a>).

Among the most frequent decisions faced by the surrogate decision makers for residents with dementia involve establishment of goals of care, issues related to feeding, and the treatment of medical issues, including infections and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The topic of surrogate decision makers and advance care planning is covered separately.

Other goals that residents may identify include achieving life goals, such as attending an important family event, completing unfinished business, achieving peace with God, and providing support for their families and caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Structuring discussion around the primary goal of care may not only improve communication but also aid in subsequent decision making for long-term care residents. At least one study showed that prioritization among these goals among caregivers was feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. For residents and families able to articulate a primary or exclusive care goal, the clinician may then translate this goal into specific treatment recommendations that can be accepted or rejected. This communication approach may lessen the burdens of decision making experienced by residents and families.</p><p>Use of videos has been proposed as a mechanism to promote resident and family understanding of goals of care and decision making options:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized controlled trial, older adults who watched a six-minute goals of care video on admission to a nursing home were more likely to identify comfort as their primary goal compared with residents who received a verbal narrative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study demonstrated that older adults exposed to a &ldquo;goals of care&rdquo; video related to the care of individuals with advanced dementia also chose comfort as their preferred goal more often than for individuals exposed to a verbal care goals explanation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another randomized trial, A 20-minute goals of care video decision aid about treatment options in advanced dementia, designed to support discussions during the nursing home care planning process, was effective in enhancing agreement on goals, increased the palliative care content of treatment plans, and reduced hospital transfers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p>It is important to realize that some families may identify different goals altogether or express multiple goals as having equal importance. However, communicating about goals may be easier than being asked to make specific treatment decisions that family members may find stressful and burdensome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Strategies for discussing goals of care are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2980638\"><span class=\"h2\">Decisions regarding nutrition and hydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nutritional status and the occurrence of weight loss are topics of concern among nursing home residents. Weight loss may threaten residents' self-identity. In addition, both residents and their families associate nutrition with life and its absence with starvation. Centers of Medicare Services (CMS) reports the percentage of residents who lose too much weight (defined as &gt;5 percent loss of body weight in one month) as a quality measure. A discussion on withdrawal of nutrition and hydration for patients at the end of life is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stopping nutrition and hydration at the end of life&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715636549\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of artificial nutrition and hydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any treatment decision, communication regarding artificial nutrition and hydration for long-term care residents should focus on the risks and benefits of the treatment and whether the decision supports the resident&rsquo;s care goals. Discussions regarding use of a gastrostomy tube for artificial nutrition and hydration occur commonly in long-term care. Other decisions include use of fluids given intravenously or subcutaneously (hypodermoclysis). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Total parenteral nutrition</a> is rarely used in long-term care facilities, mostly due to logistical and financial barriers. &#160;</p><p>For some residents, gastrostomy tube use is consistent with their care goals and has an acceptable <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> consideration. These include individuals in whom artificial nutrition and hydration permits disease-directed treatment (eg, patients with a head and neck or newly diagnosed abdominal or pelvic malignancy) and others in whom recovery of swallowing function is an anticipated outcome (eg, patients recovering from a cerebrovascular accident). For other residents, use of a gastrostomy tube supports the goal of life prolongation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> promoting function, including nursing home residents in a persistent vegetative or those with a progressive neurologic conditions (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).</p><p>Beyond these defined subsets of nursing home residents, the vast majority of decisions about gastrotomy tubes relate to patients with dementia. Among patients with advanced dementia in nursing homes, approximately one-third have feeding tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], although there are few data to suggest it improves survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] or decreases the incidence of other outcomes such as pneumonia, weight loss, and pressure ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Potential burdens associated with gastrostomy tube use include wound infections, the use of restraints to prevent residents from removing the tube, emergency room visits and hospitalizations to replace tubes that are removed or displaced and substituting the pleasure residents may have from oral intake with tube feeding and hydration. In addition, the data suggest there are significant variations in the use of feeding tubes across the United States. In one study of almost 190,000 patients, 34 percent of patients with advanced cognitive impairment had a feeding tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/40,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,44</a>]. Compared to those without a feeding tube, these patients were more likely to be of younger age, non-white race, male, divorced, had no advance directives, and had experienced a recent decline in functional status. </p><p>Beyond these issues, many family caregivers report either no or minimal communication with clinicians related to the decision for their loved one to receive a feeding tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This represents a significant opportunity to improve communication and decision making. Despite these findings, there appears to be organizationally related factors associated with a greater use of feeding tubes in these patients, including greater use in for profit, urban located, and larger (&gt;100 bed) nursing homes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/40,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,44</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H715636564\"><span class=\"h3\">Approaching discussions about artificial intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Discussions related to artificial nutrition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hydration in the nursing home for patients undergoing palliative care should include the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of a known benefit from artificial nutrition and hydration in patients approaching the end of life, including responding to issues related to hydration and starvation, which may be raised by the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> his or her family. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks associated with placement and maintenance of the feeding tube itself (including infections, aspiration, and potentially, the requirement for restraints if patients are physically unstable or violent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatives to tube feeds or other artificial nutrition systems that are more aligned with their loved ones&rsquo; condition and care goals. For patients who are able to swallow, one systematic review supported the use of high calorie supplements but found low quality evidence to support the use of appetite stimulants, assisted feeding, and modified foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p>One approach to improve feeding tube decisions has been to use decision aids with family caregivers. One randomized controlled trial demonstrated that family caregivers who received a decision aid felt less conflicted and were more likely to discuss feeding options with a health care provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In another study, surrogate decision makers who used a tube feeding decision aid had less decisional conflict and increased knowledge about the decision that was ultimately chosen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2980645\"><span class=\"h2\">Caring for infectious complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term care residents frequently have febrile episodes or can develop infections without fever, including pneumonia and urinary tract infections. Deciding whether, where, and how to treat these infections requires a thoughtful discussion among clinicians, residents, and family caregivers. Provided that the nursing home is equipped to treat infections (ie, can provide antibiotics with a proficient nursing home staff), at least one study showed that infections can be successfully treated without acute care hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In that review, patients with pneumoniae (with a respiratory rate &lt;40) were effectively treated in the nursing home, which was associated with lower costs and improved morbidity and mortality rates compared to acute care hospitalization. After consideration of their care goals as well as prognosis, residents and their families may decide with their clinicians to seek hospital evaluation and treatment for acute infections, initially provide management in the nursing home while transferring to the hospital if a resident&rsquo;s condition worsens, or focus care exclusively on the resident&rsquo;s symptoms without attempting to diagnose the underlying cause of a febrile episode.</p><p>Independent of their primary care goal, patients with a systemic infection in the context of advanced dementia have a poor prognosis. While families and clinicians may consider infections to be reversible, the development of serious infections among patients advanced dementia usually indicates that death is approaching, regardless of whether antibiotics are administered. In one study of patients diagnosed with pneumoniae, the 10-day and six-month mortality rates were 50 percent and 74 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Another study concluded that antimicrobial treatment of urinary tract infections in nursing home residents with advanced dementia did not improve survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. While hydration and antibiotic use may prolong short-term survival, this benefit may only be measured in days among most residents with advanced dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] and may also increase discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. </p><p>Therefore, for residents with comfort as their primary goal who subsequently develop a systemic infection (eg, pneumonia), care should focus on managing symptoms (eg, fever, congestion, dyspnea, and delirium) rather than aggressive treatment of the infection. Their families should be informed that use of antibiotics for managing infections in residents with advanced dementia will likely not promote comfort and may prolong the dying process. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2980652\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE PALLIATIVE CARE IN LONG-TERM CARE SETTINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited availability of palliative care programs in United States nursing homes, and significant underutilization in those facilities with programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. There are few data to inform the implementation of interventions that may improve the quality of palliative care in long-term care settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], but chief among them is ensuring greater access to hospice services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. In the United States, this has already occurred with hospice enrollment increasing from 28 to 40 percent among nursing home residents between 2004 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. A similar increase in hospice enrollment has been noted among patients with dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>The benefit of hospice services is illustrated in the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 786,328 Medicare fee-for Service beneficiaries older than age 67 who died while they were nursing home residents in 2004 and 2009, the increase in hospice use from 28 to 40 percent over this five year period was associated with significant decreases in rates of hospital transfers, feeding tube use, and a lower rate of Intensive Care Unit use in the 30 days before death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, the expansion of hospice use was also associated with a mean net increase in Medicare expenditures, reflecting greater additional spending on hospice care after adjusting for decreased spending on hospital and other care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Others note that Medicare spending on hospice care for nursing home patients grew 70 percent between 2005 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of all nursing home residents in one state who received hospice care prior to death, their families believed that hospice improved their loved ones&rsquo; symptom management and attention to their emotional needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For residents with advanced dementia in nursing homes, those receiving hospice services were more likely to receive scheduled opioid medications for pain, symptomatic treatments for dyspnea, and overall had fewer unmet needs at the end of life compared with residents dying without hospice care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p>Unfortunately, there are multiple barriers to hospice use in long-term care settings including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imprecise ability of clinicians to render prognosis in residents with dementia and other terminal, non-cancer diagnoses. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative associations between hospice and death held by residents, families, and long-term care staff.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of coverage for the room and board costs in long-term care facilities &ndash; While there is a Medicare benefit that covers skilled nursing facility admissions, it is specific for rehabilitative services associated with acute care hospitalizations and ends when the patient&rsquo;s rehabilitation progress plateaus or if the patient experiences an acute decline that prevents him or her from receiving therapy services.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, almost one-third of older adults reportedly used this benefit during their last six months life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], demonstrating that many will not achieve their rehabilitation goals and would likely benefit from receiving palliative care and hospice services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unplanned transfer to an acute care facility &ndash; Patients who are receiving hospice services may experience a decline or plateau, which may prompt a transfer to the hospital for stabilization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other interventions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfer to home &ndash; Some patients may request a transfer to home to die; however, others may attempt to return home to avoid the substantial daily nursing home costs. </p><p/><p>Although hospice services represent a potential major source of palliative care in nursing homes, one-half of individuals in nursing home hospice have enrollments of 22 days or less given these many barriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/59,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,66,67</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H469808241\" class=\"local\">'Longitudinal intake of the nursing home patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Untreated pain is a particular concern for patients in palliative care, and it appears to be a particular issue for nursing home residents, especially those with cancer. Estimates are that up to 37 percent of nursing home residents (and over 65 percent of those with cancer) report pain. (See <a href=\"#H25098909\" class=\"local\">'Pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As residents&rsquo; functional status declines and death approaches, the ability to keep the patient clean becomes a more prevalent issue for the staff. In one study, staff reported that more than 90 percent of nursing home and 70 percent of assisting living residents had problems with cleanliness, including issues related to skin and oral care, as well as care required to manage incontinence. (See <a href=\"#H469807539\" class=\"local\">'Cleanliness'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The volume of medications they take on a daily or routine basis may adversely affect their appetite and contribute to nausea and constipation. (See <a href=\"#H469807546\" class=\"local\">'Polypharmacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communication among nursing home residents, their family caregivers, clinicians, and nursing home staff is critical to meeting residents&rsquo; palliative care needs. (See <a href=\"#H2980617\" class=\"local\">'Communication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in nursing homes should be included in any and all decision making as long as they have decisional capacity. For those without decisional capacity (including those with advanced dementia), these decisions fall on surrogate decision makers. Among the most frequent decisions faced by the surrogate decision makers for residents with dementia involve establishment of goals of care, issues related to feeding, and the treatment of medical complications, including infections and pain. (See <a href=\"#H2980631\" class=\"local\">'Decision making'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For long-term care residents, it may be useful to prioritize the most important goals as those that prolong life, promote function, or maximize comfort. Structuring discussion around the primary goal of care may not only improve communication but also aide in subsequent decision making for long-term care residents. (See <a href=\"#H469807679\" class=\"local\">'Goals of care communication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few data to inform the implementation of interventions that may improve the quality of palliative care in long-term care settings, but chief among them is ensuring greater access to hospice services. In the United States, this has already occurred with hospice enrollment increasing from 15 to 43 percent among nursing home residents between 1999 and 2006. (See <a href=\"#H2980652\" class=\"local\">'Initiatives to improve palliative care in long-term care settings'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-nursing-home/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ribbe MW, Ljunggren G, Steel K, et al.
