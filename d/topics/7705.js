AD is highly heritable, even in so-called sporadic cases. The genetic basis for AD is best understood in the early-onset form, which accounts for less than 1 percent of cases and typically follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern related to mutations in genes that alter amyloid-beta (A&beta;) protein production, aggregation, or clearance. The genetic basis of late-onset AD (LOAD) is more complex, with susceptibility likely conferred by a variety of more common but less penetrant genetic factors, such as apolipoprotein E (<em>APOE</em>) alleles, interacting with environmental and epigenetic influences.</p><p>This topic will review the genetic basis of AD in both early-onset and late-onset forms. Other risk factors for dementia and the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of AD are discussed separately.

There have been three main strategies employed to identify genetic factors that predispose to the development of AD: linkage analysis, candidate gene studies, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). General principles of genetic variation and genetic association studies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic association studies: Principles and applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1027823\"><span class=\"h2\">Linkage analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first progress in understanding the genetic basis of AD resulted from studies of families displaying autosomal dominant inheritance of the disorder. These studies used linkage-based methodology, in which a relatively small number (on the order of several hundred) of nonfunctional genetic markers spaced throughout the genome are genotyped in order to determine whether a given section of chromosome was transmitted from parents to their offspring. By comparing this information with disease status, the genes responsible can be mapped to relatively large chromosomal regions. Early AD studies used linkage analysis to identify culprit regions on chromosomes 1, 14, and 21, eventually leading to discovery of the three known causative AD genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6562978\" class=\"local\">'Early-onset Alzheimer disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Whereas linkage analysis has been very successful in identifying monogenic traits in early-onset familial AD, it has had much more limited success in LOAD, which is more likely to be a complex trait. (See <a href=\"#H900049\" class=\"local\">'Challenges'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1025837\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidate gene studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Candidate gene studies can include family members or unrelated individuals and require some degree of foreknowledge about the genes and pathways involved in AD. In this approach, one or a small number of known genetic variants, called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are genotyped and compared in cases and controls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic association studies: Principles and applications&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Drawing on clues about AD pathogenesis emerging from cell biology and neurochemistry, numerous candidate gene association studies have been conducted in AD. Studies typically focus on loci with potential effects on amyloid-beta (A&beta;) production, aggregation, or clearance (ie, a functional hypothesis) or on loci suspected to be important based on prior linkage studies (ie, a positional hypothesis).</p><p>The primary success of the candidate gene approach in LOAD has been the identification of apolipoprotein E (<em>APOE</em>) risk alleles (whose location was identified originally through linkage studies). Subsequently, nearly 700 other candidate genes have been investigated based on functional hypotheses, with mostly inconsistent results. (See <a href=\"#H899448\" class=\"local\">'Apolipoprotein E'</a> below and <a href=\"#H899456\" class=\"local\">'Other candidate genes'</a> below.)</p><p>As exome and whole-genome sequencing becomes more feasible and cost efficient, the candidate gene approach may yield further insights into the heritability of LOAD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1025931\"><span class=\"h2\">Genome-wide association studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, microarray technology revolutionized genetics research, making it possible to test hundreds of thousands of candidate genes simultaneously. Such GWAS allow for large-scale, largely hypothesis-free inquiries aimed at identifying novel genetic risk factors for AD. </p><p>In AD, multiple GWAS have been performed to date, largely confirming the importance of <em>APOE </em>and implicating a growing number of other potential loci (see <a href=\"#H899456\" class=\"local\">'Other candidate genes'</a> below). To date, information from over 1375 candidate gene and genome-wide association studies, implicating nearly 700 candidate genes, has been curated by the Alzheimer Disease Forum in the <a href=\"http://www.alzforum.org/res/com/gen/alzgene&amp;token=0SM8TegfFRL7gaY+yqo9TJjnqUjyGTYJ+tmQqr8VY+U2S0jkupoLf1kme0tOI6lqrwC1JCwUsNIWoeWxLU0oqw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16195\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">AlzGene database</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6562978\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY-ONSET ALZHEIMER DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first progress in understanding the genetic basis of AD resulted from studies of families displaying autosomal dominant inheritance of the disorder. Families with autosomal dominant AD are those with at least three affected individuals in two or more generations, with two of the individuals being first-degree relatives of the third. In these families, affected individuals typically develop symptoms of AD between the ages of 30 and 60 years. Most, but not all, families with early-onset AD show an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The pattern may be masked in small families or those with premature deaths (ie, prior to the anticipated age of clinical symptom onset) from unrelated causes.</p><p>Early studies in families with autosomal dominant AD used linkage-based methodology to isolate relatively large culprit regions on chromosomes 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], and 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This facilitated the eventual identification of causative mutations in the three genes: amyloid precursor protein (<em>APP</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], presenilin 1 (<em>PSEN1</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and presenilin 2 (<em>PSEN2</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Although these mutations collectively account for less than 1 percent of all AD cases and 60 to 70 percent of early-onset AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>], their discovery substantially increased the understanding of basic AD pathophysiology. A resource for the tabulation of <em>APP</em>, <em>PSEN1</em>, and <em>PSEN2</em> mutations associated with AD is the <a href=\"http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/ADMutations&amp;token=6t1TqIEa8C2tiQB8UYOacarsFoCzBRs7yTHLi023Aq+b8cuRO27sGg+EOO33P8nn&amp;TOPIC_ID=16195\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Alzheimer Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia Database</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2663392\"><span class=\"h2\">Amyloid precursor protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>APP</em> gene is located on chromosome 21q and encodes the protein product, APP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. More than 30 mutations in this gene have been described in association with AD, accounting for 10 to 15 percent of early-onset familial AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Mutations are fully penetrant, and age of onset is closely correlated with parental age of onset and mutation type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The median age of onset across all mutation types is approximately 49 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97086\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97086 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The function of APP in neurons is not well understood, but it is believed to be important in synaptic transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. APP is cleaved proteolytically by three enzymes, known as &alpha;-, &beta;-, and &gamma;-secretase. In the amyloidogenic pathway, &beta;-secretase and later &gamma;-secretase cleave APP into two peptides of varying lengths. The longer of the two fragments, amyloid-beta 42 (A&beta;42), is more hydrophobic and prone to fibril formation.</p><p>Nearly all pathogenic <em>APP</em> mutations identified so far cluster around the three major processing sites that are relevant to the generation of amyloidogenic A&szlig;, increasing production of A&beta;, or altering the ratio of A&beta;42 to A&beta;40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. Most are dominant missense mutations, although rare families with <em>APP</em> locus duplication or recessive inheritance patterns have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2663399\"><span class=\"h2\">Presenilin 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>PSEN1</em> gene is located on chromosome 14q and encodes the protein product, PSEN1. More than 150 <em>PSEN1 </em>mutations have been described in association with AD, accounting for up to 50 percent of early-onset familial AD. Mutations are fully penetrant and associated with an earlier median age of onset (43 years) compared with <em>APP</em> and <em>PSEN2</em> mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F97086\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97086 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In longitudinal kindred studies, preclinical cognitive decline is evident more than 10 years before the onset of clinical impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Several different functions have been ascribed to PSEN1, including regulation of intracellular calcium signaling, cell cycle and cell death, trafficking of membrane proteins, regulation of &beta;-catenin stability, and Notch signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. PSEN1 likely affects AD pathogenesis through its role as a member of the four-protein complex (PSEN1, APH1, PEN2, nicastrin) responsible for &gamma;-secretase cleavage of APP to release A&beta; peptides of varying lengths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Most mutations in <em>PSEN1</em> increase the generation of the highly fibrillogenic A&beta;42 species, alter the kinetics of A&beta; peptide turnover, and enhance accumulation of A&beta; in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of A&beta; are also elevated. The majority of <em>PSEN1</em> mutations are missense mutations, but small deletions and insertions have been described as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2663406\"><span class=\"h2\">Presenilin 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>PSEN2</em> gene is located on chromosome 1q and encodes the protein product, PSEN2. Fewer than 20 <em>PSEN2 </em>mutations have been described, making it the rarest form of early-onset familial AD. The age of onset in reported cases is later and varies more widely with <em>PSEN2</em> mutations than it does with mutations in <em>APP</em> or <em>PSEN1</em>. Mutations are estimated to be 95 percent penetrant, meaning that up to 5 percent of patients carrying a disease-causing mutation will not develop symptoms of AD in their lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. This contrasts with <em>APP</em> and <em>PSEN1</em> mutations, which are felt to be fully penetrant.</p><p>The function of PSEN2 and the role of <em>PSEN2 </em>mutations in the pathogenesis of AD are not well understood. <em>PSEN2</em> mutations may act in part by enhancing apoptotic activity that leads to neurodegeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Similar to <em>PSEN1</em> mutations, <em>PSEN2</em> mutations alter the cleavage activity of &gamma;-secretase and increase the ratio of A&beta;42 to A&beta;40. <em>PSEN2</em> is approximately 60 percent homologous to <em>PSEN1</em>, and may represent a very early chromosomal separation or partial duplication from the <em>PSEN1</em> gene.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H912645\"><span class=\"h2\">Trisomy 21</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) commonly develop clinical and neuropathologic features of AD by the fifth decade of life due to the presence of an extra copy of the <em>APP</em> gene, the locus for which is on the long arm of chromosome 21. This results in increased production of mRNA and subsequently APP protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3679136792\"><span class=\"h2\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>APP</em>, <em>PSEN1</em>, and <em>PSEN2</em> mutations account for approximately two-thirds of familial autosomal dominant AD and less than 10 percent of early-onset AD overall. Rare variants at other loci may contribute to early-onset AD risk, including some that overlap with late-onset AD (LOAD; eg, <em>SORL1</em>, <em>TREM2</em>) and others related to the endolysosomal pathway (eg, <em>RUFY1</em>, <em>PSD2</em>, <em>TCIRG1</em>, <em>RIN3</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2663413\"><span class=\"h1\">LATE-ONSET ALZHEIMER DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic basis of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) is more complex, with susceptibility conferred by a variety of more common but less penetrant genetic factors likely interacting with environmental and epigenetic influences. To date, the most firmly established genetic risk factor for late-onset disease is apolipoprotein E (<em>APOE</em>). Many more candidate genes have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), but their effects on LOAD risk are generally smaller and many have not been validated independently. Some of the more replicated candidate genes are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H899448\"><span class=\"h2\">Apolipoprotein E</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>APOE</em> gene is located on chromosome 19 and exists in three alleles: epsilon 2, 3, and 4. The <em>APOE</em> epsilon 4 (&epsilon;4) allele was first recognized as a risk factor for LOAD in 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]; since then, multiple studies have confirmed its importance as a risk factor for AD, and possibly vascular dementia as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/36-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1026217\"><span class=\"h3\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of the <em>APOE </em>&epsilon;4 risk allele varies greatly across ethnic groups. In Caucasians, the allele frequency of the &epsilon;4 variant is approximately 15 percent; in African Americans, it is approximately 25 percent. Among African populations, the frequency ranges from 8 percent in Moroccans to as high as 41 percent in Pygmies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Asian populations generally have lower carrier rates, ranging from 7 percent in the Chinese to 24 percent in Malay Aborigines. Its increased frequency in populations where food is, or was in the recent past, scarce, suggests that &epsilon;4 is a &quot;thrifty&quot; allele that imparts a competitive advantage through energy <span class=\"nowrap\">conservation/utilization</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1026225\"><span class=\"h3\">Strength of association</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates for the increased risk conferred by the &epsilon;4 allele vary by population studied and differ based on age and gender. Individuals with two copies of the &epsilon;4 allele are at the highest risk. Typical estimates suggest that one &epsilon;4 allele confers two- to threefold increased odds of AD whereas two copies (&epsilon;4 homozygous) confer 8- to 12-fold increased odds of AD compared with noncarriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/10,45,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,45,47</a>].</p><p>Examples of studies demonstrating the association between <em>APOE</em> &epsilon;4 genotype and dementia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Rotterdam study, a population-based cohort of 7983 people aged 55 or older, carriers of the <span class=\"nowrap\">&epsilon;2/&epsilon;4</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">&epsilon;3/&epsilon;4</span> genotypes each had a relative risk of AD and vascular dementia that was approximately double that of <span class=\"nowrap\">&epsilon;3/&epsilon;3</span> carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

While these variants are currently not diagnostically useful, they may offer mechanistic insights that will potentially lead to new therapies. (See <a href=\"#H900049\" class=\"local\">'Challenges'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H900049\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES</span></p><p><strong>Limitations of linkage analyses</strong> &mdash; Linkage studies suffer from several important limitations, the sum of which largely explains why this technique has not been more effective in determining the specific genetic bases of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD). First, the small number of markers used results in low resolution to identify linked regions and the responsible genes. These studies are also vulnerable to locus heterogeneity, which occurs when different families have different AD risk genes. Since linkage statistics basically sum the evidence for a disease gene in a given region over all families, the net evidence for linkage in a given region is often weak, despite the presence of a true risk gene. Many early linkage studies also suffered from insufficient sample size.</p><p><strong>Limitations of candidate gene studies</strong> &mdash; Of the very large number of AD loci implicated by candidate gene studies, very few have been replicated consistently. Possible explanations include false-positive results, lack of adequate power to detect or replicate an association because of sample size, lack of informative markers within a gene, locus heterogeneity (different genes underlying the same AD phenotype), and clinical heterogeneity (multiple clinical subtypes associated with different sets of susceptibility genes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Lack of consistency across studies may also be due to intralocus heterogeneity (ie, different risk mutations within the same gene).</p><p><strong>Limitations of genome-wide association studies</strong> &mdash; Although many of the limitations inherent to candidate gene studies have been overcome by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), important limitations and challenges do remain. Overall, GWAS have not explained as much of the variance in AD as was originally expected, a challenge that is not unique to AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. There are several hypotheses about why this might be the case across multiple common diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-association-studies-principles-and-applications#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic association studies: Principles and applications&quot;, section on 'Missing heritability'</a>.)</p><p>In AD, one possibility is that the majority of the heritability has already been explained by the net effect of the thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) nominally associated with AD, but that these SNPs fail to meet the multiple test-corrected significance threshold. If true, sample sizes of hundreds of thousands or more subjects would be needed to separate the true from the false associations. Considering the very small effects these SNPs are predicted to have on AD risk, the disease-predictive value or therapeutic target potential gained would likely be minimal. Larger sample sizes do not result in larger effect sizes, however, and the small effect sizes associated with the vast majority of SNPs thus far identified may be the most important impediment to clinical relevance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. </p><p>As with the candidate gene approach, many individual GWAS findings over the years have not been verified in independent samples. Several factors contribute to this inconsistency, including variable definitions of cases and controls, subject ascertainment, variability of SNP genotyping platforms and microarray chips, and sample size. </p><p><strong>Unexplained risk</strong> &mdash; A basic assumption regarding genetic determinants of a complex disease such as LOAD is that common variants in many genes will each lead to a small rise or fall in the risk of disease, and that the overall risk of disease is determined by the combination of multiple variants and environmental exposures. However, genetic studies to date have a mixed track record, and a substantial proportion of LOAD heritability remains unexplained. </p><p>Aside from the limitations of candidate and genome-wide association studies discussed above, one possibility for this is termed the &quot;common disease-rare variant&quot; theory. This theory would posit that multiple, rare, family-specific mutations in common genes and biologic pathways explain the remaining AD heritability. A large proportion of these rare variants are not detectable using the microarray chips used in GWAS. As the cost of next-generation sequencing becomes increasingly affordable, large-scale projects are underway to identify these rare variants and test them for association with AD using gene-based methods.</p><p>More complex statistic models are also being tested and used in an attempt to explain the remaining AD heritability. As with most complex diseases and biologic systems in general, AD pathogenesis involves multiple proteins in multiple inter- and intracellular pathways with multiple levels of regulation and feedback loops. Pathway and gene set enrichment analyses combine multiple lines of evidence, such as SNP association, gene expression, animal models, and literature mining, to identify pathways and networks involved in disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/117,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">117,118</a>]. As an example, an analysis of 2344 AD cases and 7076 controls showed significant enrichment of AD-associated SNPs in genes in several pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. As expected, the &quot;Alzheimer disease&quot; pathway showed the greatest level of enrichment, but several other pathways were significant, including &quot;regulation of autophagy,&quot; &quot;natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity,&quot; &quot;antigen processing and presentation,&quot; and &quot;RIG-I-like receptor signaling.&quot; </p><p><strong>Translation to therapy</strong> &mdash; Despite statistic evidence for association, most functional variants in the established AD risk genes have not yet been identified, and the precise roles of their encoded proteins in AD pathogenesis are poorly understood. To date, no therapeutic interventions have been developed to intervene in the genes and pathways identified through GWAS. Functional studies such as mouse knockout models are required to better understand functions in both the context of normal biology and the pathology of AD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H900056\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with early-onset AD and those with a family history of AD may inquire about genetic testing, which has become more accessible through clinical laboratories.

Testing can either be symptomatic (ie, an individual patient diagnosed with early-onset AD and a family history suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance) or predictive (ie, presymptomatic individuals with a known mutation in their family). Because the range of symptom onset varies more widely than initially recognized, mutations in amyloid precursor protein (<em>APP</em>), presenilin 1 (<em>PSEN1</em>), and presenilin 2 (<em>PSEN2</em>) should still be considered in cases of late-onset AD (LOAD) with a consistent dominantly inherited pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Prenatal testing is also available when a disease-causing mutation has been identified.

Since multiple mutations in <em>PSEN1</em>, <em>PSEN2</em>, and <em>APP</em> can all cause AD, sequencing the entire coding regions of the genes is necessary to comprehensively assess risk; this is not covered by commercial testing. </p><p>Testing for highly penetrant genetic mutations like <em>APP, PSEN1</em>,<em> </em>and <em>PSEN2</em> carries important implications for family members. Genetic counseling of symptomatic patients should be performed in the presence of the individual's legal guardian or a family member to ensure adequate informed consent and an understanding of the purpose of testing, the possible results, and their implications for other family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-alzheimer-disease/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. Studies have shown that relatively few family members of individuals with early-onset AD choose to be tested.

It is ultimately up to the relatives of early-onset AD patients whether to undergo genetic testing. Clinicians and genetic counselors have the responsibility to inform them of the option and communicate the implications of having potentially inherited a dominant mutation with almost complete penetrance.
