In patients with acalculous cholecystitis, a right-upper quadrant ultrasound is usually non-specific, with findings consistent with gallbladder thickening or pericholecystic fluid, and absence of gallstones. Hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HIDA) is more useful in this situation since it will demonstrate a non-functioning gallbladder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-hepatobiliary-complaints/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In patients with papillary stenosis, a narrowing of the terminal common bile duct with proximal dilatation and extrahepatic or intrahepatic bile duct stricturing may be seen; in AIDS cholangiopathy, the ducts may have a classic beaded pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-hepatobiliary-complaints/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>ERCP permits diagnostic sampling of bile, which can be examined for neoplastic cells, protozoa, or cultured for viruses, as well as ductal biopsy. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-hepatobiliary-complaints/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. ERCP can be used for therapeutic interventions, such as sphincterotomy (effective for papillary stenosis) and removal of stones, or to stent strictures.</p><p>Although magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may also be helpful for imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-hepatobiliary-complaints/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], ERCP still offers the advantage of tissue sampling and potential sphincterotomy, if needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Laparoscopy with biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopy may be useful to identify any peritoneal pathology, as seen in tuberculosis or malignancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver biopsy can be considered in patients with infiltrative processes, mitochondrial toxicity, chronic viral hepatitis, or neoplasm.

The usefulness of liver biopsy in diagnosing drug-induced liver injury is limited to when eosinophils are present; otherwise many of the necroinflammatory changes that can be seen in drug-related hepatotoxicity can overlap with chronic viral hepatitis. Discontinuation of potential hepatotoxic medications with careful follow-up of aminotransferases over time is a useful strategy. A liver biopsy can be considered when aminotransferases remain abnormal.</p><p>If a liver biopsy is done, appropriate culture and special stains of the specimen will increase the yield when infection is suspected. Cultures should include testing for routine bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal pathogens. All appropriate clinical information, including the degree of immunosuppression, should be communicated to the pathologist since granuloma formation can be quite poor in patients with advanced AIDS and MAC infection.</p><p>If mitochondrial toxicity is suspected, electron microscopy can confirm the presence of mitochondrial abnormalities (such as paracrystalline inclusions and swollen mitochondrial cristae).</p><p>However, in many of these circumstances, the liver biopsy may not be needed. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of disseminated infection, such as MAC, the diagnosis is often made by examination of other sites, such as blood or bone marrow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitochondrial toxicity is often strongly suggested by the presence of elevated serum lactate in a patient with abdominal bloating, weight loss, nausea, and fatigue.</p><p/><p>In contrast, a liver biopsy may be helpful in the setting of chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C to help stage the disease and to determine if treatment is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-natural-history-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-c-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, natural history, and diagnosis of hepatitis C in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hepatitis-b-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hepatitis B in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected patients with severe immunosuppression are at risk for AIDS cholangiopathy and opportunistic infections, such as <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex disease, which can cause significant hepatobiliary disease. Due to shared routes of infection, HIV-infected patients are also at risk for hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections, which are a major cause for morbidity and mortality, such as decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Hepatobiliary complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic steatosis is associated with viral factors (eg, hepatitis C genotype 3 infection), host factors (such as visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia) and chronic nucleoside analog use (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stavudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">stavudine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=didanosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">didanosine</a>). In the setting of necroinflammation, hepatic steatosis can lead to liver fibrosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Hepatobiliary complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected patients may develop drug-induced liver injury from antiretroviral medications or from commonly used medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>. Several studies have demonstrated that HIV-infected patients with chronic viral hepatitis and baseline elevations of aminotransferases are at increased risk of ART-induced hepatotoxicity than HIV-infected patients without hepatitis B or C infection. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Hepatobiliary complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial efforts in the evaluation of the HIV-infected patient with symptoms or signs consistent with hepatobiliary disease (eg, right upper quadrant pain, nausea, jaundice) should be directed at determining whether there is intrahepatic or extrahepatic disease. Knowledge of the patient's CD4 cell count will help guide the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are usually elevated in the setting of liver injury (eg, drug-induced liver injury or viral hepatitis). Elevations of either alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin are suggestive of a cholestatic pattern or obstructive process (eg, tumor or lymphadenopathy at the porta hepatis). Measures of synthetic liver function include prothrombin time and serum albumin; abnormalities in these markers suggest advanced liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging is particularly helpful if an obstructive process, opportunistic infection, or malignancy is suspected. If CT or ultrasound demonstrates biliary duct pathology, stricturing, or dilated ducts, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be indicated for diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention.
