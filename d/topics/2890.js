Two general categories have been described: enhanced ectopy with tachyarrhythmias, and bradyarrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Digoxin can affect cardiac tissue in a number of ways which may result in toxicity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> directly inhibits the ATPase dependent sodium-potassium pump, increasing intracellular sodium. This, in turn, reduces the activity of a sodium-calcium exchanger that normally extrudes calcium from the cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The resulting increase in intracellular calcium is responsible for the positive inotropic action of digoxin. The fluxes in calcium can also have electrophysiologic effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac glycosides activate ryanodine receptors, which could contribute to increased calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and could play a role in the inotropic action of glycosides in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> increases vagal tone through central and peripheral effects; however, at excess levels, digoxin may augment cardiac sympathetic tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p>As a result of the effect on intracellular calcium concentrations and vagal tone, high levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> can have a variety of effects that facilitate the development of arrhythmias. They can enhance and depress automaticity, induce triggered membrane activity (especially delayed afterdepolarizations), increase or decrease excitability, slow conduction, and alter refractoriness, also producing conditions conducive to the development of reentrant arrhythmias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13658052\"><span class=\"h1\">DIGOXIN-INDUCED ARRHYTHMIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide range of arrhythmias occurring at almost any intracardiac location can be seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity, depending in part upon the age of the patient and the state of the myocardium. Accentuation of vagal effects and resulting bradyarrhythmias are more commonly seen in younger, healthier individuals. Conversely, patients with severe cardiac disease and concurrent digoxin toxicity are more susceptible to ventricular ectopy and tachyarrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-miscellaneous-diagnoses#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Miscellaneous diagnoses&quot;, section on 'Digitalis toxicity'</a>.)</p><p>There are, however, some arrhythmias that are generally not directly induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>. Atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and Mobitz type II second degree AV block are the least&nbsp;likely of all the arrhythmias to be caused by digoxin toxicity. However, superimposed digoxin toxicity may occur in these settings, for example leading to an excessively slow or regularized ventricular response in atrial fibrillation.</p><p>The arrhythmias associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity will be discussed according to their myocardial site of origin, including the sinoatrial nodal tissue, atrial myocardium, atrioventricular nodal tissue, and ventricular myocardium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13658144\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinus bradycardia, tachycardia, block, and arrest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> and digoxin toxicity on the SA node is often difficult to determine because of both indirect and direct actions. As an example, improved hemodynamics in heart failure usually results in a fall in heart rate due to alterations in autonomic balance. Alternatively, sinus bradycardia may also be one of the earliest signs of digoxin excess.</p><p>Cardiac glycosides have no direct effect on slowing automaticity in the isolated SA node or in the transplanted human heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. However, the diseased SA node may be quite sensitive to cardiac glycosides, resulting in sinus bradycardia and SA nodal block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity/abstract/4,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19-21</a>]. Animal and human studies suggest that the slowing of the heart rate in this setting is due both to increased vagal tone (mediated by hypersensitization of carotid sinus baroreceptors, central stimulation, increased vagal traffic, and possible potentiation of the effect of acetylcholine on the SA node) and to sympatholytic activity.</p><p>While most commonly sinus bradycardia is seen, the sinus pacemaker may accelerate in the presence of excess <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>.

Animal studies suggest that the atrial tachycardia is probably mediated by increased automaticity in the atrium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed afterpotentials, often occurring near and perhaps sometimes within the SA node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity/abstract/26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,29</a>]. The AV block probably results from the rapid atrial rate, as well as the vagotonic activity and a direct effect of digoxin on AV nodal conduction (see below).</p><p>Also referred to as &quot;paroxysmal&quot; atrial tachycardia (PAT) with AV block, this arrhythmia is strongly suggestive of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity in patients taking this medication or in cases of suspected overdose. However, the arrhythmia is typically not paroxysmal when induced by digoxin; rather, it is a persistent arrhythmia until specific therapy is instituted or digoxin levels fall below the toxic range (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-atrial-tachycardia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal atrial tachycardia&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>). It should be noted that most cases of atrial tachycardia with block are not due to digoxin excess in contemporary practice.</p><p>Clinically, up to one-half of patients with nonparoxysmal atrial tachycardia with AV nodal block have a P wave morphology similar to the sinus P wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56994\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef56994 \">waveform 2</a>). This observation supports the suggestion in animal studies that the ectopic site is often near, or is perhaps in, the SA node. The remaining cases arise at other sites and typically have an abnormal P wave axis as seen in the ectopic atrial tachycardias.</p><p>Atrial tachycardia with block may superficially resemble atrial flutter. There are two major distinguishing features between these arrhythmias:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The atrial rate is faster (usually 250 to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min)</span> with atrial flutter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baseline between P waves is isoelectric in atrial tachycardia with block, while there is a constantly undulating baseline between the flutter waves in atrial flutter.</p><p/><p>It is important to distinguish between atrial flutter and atrial tachycardia due to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> excess since the administration of additional digoxin, which may be an appropriate therapy for atrial flutter, can accelerate the atrial rate in an atrial tachycardia, increasing the degree of AV block and potentially precipitating a more serious digoxin-toxic arrhythmia.

A more important clinical problem is the effect of digoxin toxicity on transmission of atrial stimuli through the AV node in patients with preexisting atrial fibrillation. The electrocardiographic findings vary with increasing degrees of digoxin toxicity and with the possible presence of block above or below the pacemaker (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64396%7ECARD%2F76154%7ECARD%2F55119%7ECARD%2F66940\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64396 graphicRef76154 graphicRef55119 graphicRef66940 \">waveform 3A-D</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

However, the diagnosis of atrial flutter may be difficult to establish when, as commonly occurs during digoxin therapy, the atrial flutter has a slow ventricular response, with a rate that overlaps that seen in other supraventricular tachycardias, such as nonparoxysmal atrial tachycardia with a 2:1 AV response due to digoxin intoxication.

VF can, however, be induced by the use of electric cardioversion in patients with an atrial tachyarrhythmia associated with excess digoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24718477\"><span class=\"h3\">Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An unusual arrhythmia is the so-called &quot;bidirectional&quot; ventricular tachycardia in which the rhythm is regular but every other beat has a different axis as it travels alternately down different conduction pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71796\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef71796 \">waveform 7</a>).

The incidence of digoxin toxicity appears to be lower than had been seen historically, as a result of several changes in clinical practice including appropriate dose reductions in patients with renal dysfunction, better methods for measuring plasma digoxin levels, and the availability of other medications for the treatment of chronic heart failure and tachyarrhythmias leading to a reduced reliance on digoxin. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence of digoxin toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintaining trough <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> levels at the lower range (eg, between 0.5 and 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> is recommended to help minimize toxicity. Life-threatening digoxin-induced arrhythmias occur at substantially increased frequency as the plasma digoxin concentration rises above 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. However, signs of toxicity may occur at much lower plasma levels, especially in the presence of comorbid conditions (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia, myocardial ischemia, older age with heart failure). Hypokalemia is a particularly important risk factor that can promote digoxin-induced arrhythmias even if the digoxin concentration is thought to be within the &quot;therapeutic&quot; range.

Accentuation of vagal effects and resulting bradyarrhythmias is more commonly seen in younger, healthier individuals. Conversely, patients with severe cardiac disease and concurrent digoxin toxicity are more susceptible to ventricular ectopy and tachyarrhythmias.

Also referred to as paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, this arrhythmia is strongly suggestive of digoxin toxicity in patients on the drug. However, the arrhythmia is not typically paroxysmal when induced by digoxin; rather, it is a persistent arrhythmia until specific therapy is instituted or digoxin levels fall below the toxic range.
