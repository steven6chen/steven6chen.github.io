By definition, a hyperechogenic kidney has a renal cortex more echogenic than the liver and spleen. It is important to note that normal fetal kidneys can be physiologically hyperechogenic in the first and early second trimester.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2284604749\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR CYSTIC RENAL DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound examination of fetuses with cystic renal changes or hyperechoic kidneys includes assessment of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amniotic fluid volume</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney size</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticomedullary differentiation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level of renal echogenicity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location and size of renal cysts (if present)</p><p/><p>Prenatal ultrasonic appearance of the fetal renal cystic diseases is characterized by small or large cysts and renal hyperechogenicity on prenatal ultrasound examination. Renal cystic structures can be localized to the cortex, medulla or both, and represent dilated tubules, glomerular cystic dilation, or real cysts. Renal hyperechogenicity is secondary to the numerous interfaces created by microscopic cysts and dilated tubules and to interstitial fibrosis and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Corticomedullary differentiation can be absent or present and, if present, is further classified as normal, increased, or reversed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Normal corticomedullary differentiation is defined according to the echogenicity of the cortex and medulla. The combination of renal cortex as echogenic as liver or spleen and relatively hypoechogenic medulla is characteristic of well-defined, normal corticomedullary differentiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29937740\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several classification systems for congenital cystic renal disease have been proposed, taking into account the pathologic, clinical, and genetic features of these disorders. For clinical purposes, it is useful to classify cystic renal diseases that present in the prenatal period in the following way:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary disorders</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal cysts seen with <span class=\"nowrap\">syndromes/sequences</span> (glomerulocystic and medullary cystic <span class=\"nowrap\">dysplasia/</span> nephronophthisis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonhereditary disorders</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal dysplasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multicystic kidney disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Obstructive cystic dysplasia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nondysplastic nonhereditary renal cysts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal cystic tumors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Simple renal cysts</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12017265\"><span class=\"h1\">HEREDITARY DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the hereditary cystic renal disease are due to primary ciliopathies. Primary ciliopathies are secondary to single gene mutations that lead to defective proteins and abnormal ciliary formation or function. The primary or &quot;immobile&quot; cilia is a microtubule base organelle that extends from the cell surface and is present in almost all vertebrate cells. The cilia transduce molecular signals from the extracellular environment acting as an &quot;antenna&quot; for the cell.</p><p>Primary ciliopathies commonly present with cystic changes in the kidneys, hepatobiliary disease, pancreatic cysts or dysplasia, cerebellar abnormalities, retinal degeneration, colobomas of the retina and iris, polydactyly, abnormal bone growth, and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Differential diagnosis is dependent on the location of renal involvement typical to the disease, family history, and characteristic associated anomalies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rare disorder, occurring in 1:20,000 live births. Fetal death may occur because of severe oligohydramnios, and neonatal death may occur because of pulmonary insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>ARPKD is caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene (polycystic kidney and hepatic disease gene) on chromosome 6p, which encodes the protein fibrocystin. Fibrocystin is normally expressed in the primary cilia and the basal body of renal and bile duct epithelial cells. Its exact function is not known; however, fibrocystin likely acts as a membrane receptor, interacting with extracellular protein ligands and transducing intracellular signals to the nucleus involved in collecting-duct and biliary differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children#H88678691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Renal pathology in ARPKD is characterized by nonobstructive dilatation or ectasia of the collecting tubules located in the renal medulla, resulting in microcysts up to 2 mm in diameter. The cysts may expand into the cortex in severe cases. The outer renal cortex remains normal since there are no tubules in this area. The severity of the renal disease is proportional to the percentage of nephrons affected by cysts and is correlated with the severity of the PHKD1 mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. All affected individuals have some degree of liver involvement with biliary dysgenesis and hepatic fibrosis.</p><p>ARPKD has been subclassified into perinatal, neonatal, and juvenile groups. Renal involvement is more common in cases with perinatal presentation, whereas liver involvement is more typical of later diagnosis of ARPKD.</p><p>The pathogenesis, pathology, and clinical manifestations of ARPKD are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The predominant prenatal ultrasound feature of ARPKD is uniform, massive enlargement of the kidneys with preservation of the reniform shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69859%7EOBGYN%2F79653\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69859 graphicRef79653 \">image 1A-B</a>) with diffuse hyperechogenicity of both cortex and medulla, and loss of corticomedullary differentiation.</p><p>The sonographic features of ARPKD can initially appear anytime during gestation. Elongated hyperechogenic kidneys with normal transverse and anteroposterior diameters may be the only ultrasound finding before the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Serial ultrasound examinations with measurement of kidney dimensions that confirm progressive enlargement and reduction in amniotic fluid volume help establish the diagnosis. This is particularly important before 24 weeks of gestation when the diagnosis is less certain. The presence of severe oligohydramnios, especially when there is a family history of ARPKD, increases the probability that the presumptive diagnosis is accurate.</p><p>The kidney size is typically 4 to 15 standard deviations above the mean size for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Due to the large kidney size, the abdominal circumference is larger than expected for menstrual dates. Late in pregnancy, isolated macroscopic cysts less than 10 mm in size are visible in the renal medulla in one third of cases. The massive enlargement of the kidneys is often associated with oligohydramnios and a small or absent bladder due to the drastic reduction in urine production. Pulmonary hypoplasia can occur when oligohydramnios is present early in gestation. However, oligohydramnios is not always present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-amniotic-fluid-volume-regulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of amniotic fluid volume regulation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In early cases confined to the medulla, a normal peripheral cortex seen as a relatively hypoechoic peripheral rim can help in differential diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Pyramidal hyperechogenicity resembling medullary nephrocalcinosis (calcium deposits) with reversal of corticomedullary differentiation has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This finding is important since there are very few other causes of reversed corticomedullary differentiation. Amniotic fluid volume is preserved and these patients have a better prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. By comparison, in children and adults, the kidney size is less prominent and a hypoechoic outer cortical rim with reversed corticomedullary differentiation, medullary macrocysts, or echoic nonshadowing foci in the medulla is usually seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The frequency of extrarenal structural fetal abnormalities is not increased. Associated liver disease develops in late childhood and is not evident on prenatal ultrasound; however, pulmonary hypoplasia may be present. This may be important in the differential diagnosis with other syndromes that are associated with other organ involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Obstetric management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ARPKD is likely when there are bilateral significantly enlarged echogenic kidneys, a small or absent bladder, and oligohydramnios; however, a precise prenatal diagnosis cannot be made with certainty by ultrasound alone. Echogenic kidneys without cysts and with normal amniotic fluid volume may represent a variant of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Fetuses with very large kidneys and severe oligohydramnios are likely to have a poor outcome (eg, pulmonary hypoplasia), whereas when amniotic fluid volume remains normal and the kidneys are moderately enlarged, there is a higher likelihood of survival without significant morbidity. </p><p>ARPKD is not associated with an increased frequency of abnormal karyotype; therefore, chromosome studies are not helpful for confirming the diagnosis, but can be useful for excluding other disorders in the differential diagnosis associated with an abnormal karyotype. Additionally, amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling can be performed so molecular diagnostic tests can be done on fetal DNA, which can sometimes confirm the diagnosis of ARPKD. Prenatal diagnosis is possible using haplotype analysis or direct mutation analysis on the <em>PKHD1</em> gene. <em>PKHD1</em> is a large gene extending over a 500-kilobase genomic segment on chromosome 6p12. Direct mutation analysis has been reported to detect 85 percent of the cases. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, a wide range of mutations and high frequency of compound heterozygotes makes the prediction of phenotype challenging. The phenotype of ARPKD can also be mimicked by ADPKD and mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta (<em>HNF1B</em>) gene, which encodes the transcription factor <em>HNF1B</em>, as well as by other gene defects that cause the hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Molecular genetic testing is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children#H172118677\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;, section on 'Molecular genetic testing'</a>.) </p><p>Asymptomatic siblings of affected children should be evaluated for hepatic fibrosis and renal lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children#H25824024\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;, section on 'Counseling'</a>.)</p><p>Survival of individuals with ARPKD depends upon the subtype: perinatal (hours), neonatal (months), infantile (up to 10 years), and juvenile (decades). Perinatal death is related to both renal and pulmonary insufficiency. However, if pulmonary hypoplasia is not life threatening, dialysis and renal transplantation have been reported to prolong survival. Long-term pulmonary function appears to be good in those who did not require mechanical ventilation in the newborn period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Pregnancy interruption is an option due to reduced life expectancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;, section on 'Outcome'</a>.)</p><p>Follow-up in pregnancy involves assessment of the kidneys and amniotic fluid volume every two weeks. When there is a presumptive diagnosis of ARPKD, neonatal mortality of 30 to 40 percent due to pulmonary hypoplasia has been reported. One-year survival rates of 92 to 95 percent have been reported in patients who survive the first month of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].Such patients should be delivered at a facility with level IV neonatal intensive care capacity. Cesarean delivery for abdominal dystocia for massively enlarged kidneys should be discussed with parents. Given the high perinatal mortality and need for hemodialysis in survivors and renal transplant in the long-term, detailed discussion with parents regarding their preferences for aggressive perinatal treatment should take place. Age at diagnosis impacts on the age at end stage renal disease. In one cohort, 25 percent of patients who presented in the perinatal period required renal replacement therapy by 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Autosomal dominant polycystic renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited renal cystic disease. Although the typical age of clinical onset is in the third to fifth decade of life, rarely (&lt;1 percent of cases) ADPKD can present in utero or in the neonatal period with ultrasound changes, similar to ARPKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>ADPKD is characterized by the slow development (over decades) of large spherical cystic dilatation in all parts of the nephron, although the initial differentiation to nephrons and the collecting system are normal. The renal pathology is focal with areas of abnormal nephrons scattered among areas of normal nephrons. The tubule wall, which is lined by a single layer of epithelial cells, expands and then rapidly closes off from the tubule of origin. This is different from ARPKD in which cysts are derived from collecting tubules and remain connected to the nephron of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Initially, cysts may be localized to the distal nephron and the collecting duct; in later stages, they are spread to both the cortex and medulla. As the cysts enlarge, they severely compromise the functional integrity of the remaining normal parenchyma. Approximately 50 percent of ADPKD patients will progress to end stage renal disease, requiring transplant or dialysis by late middle age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and mechanisms of cyst growth&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=course-and-treatment-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Course and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Extrarenal abnormalities include cysts in other organs, such as the liver, seminal vesicles (in males), pancreas, and arachnoid membrane. There may also be noncystic abnormalities, such as intracranial and coronary artery aneurysms and dolichoectasia, aortic root dilatation and aneurysms, mitral valve prolapse, and abdominal wall hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The estimated incidence at birth is 1:400 to 1000 deliveries; however, this disorder is rarely identified prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. ADPKD is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance. The disease is caused by mutations in either of the two genes encoding plasma membrane&ndash;spanning polycystin 1 and polycystin 2 (PKD1 on chromosome 16p13.3) and PKD2 (on chromosome 4q21), respectively. The polycystins regulate tubular and vascular development in the kidneys and other organs (liver, brain, heart, and pancreas) and interact to increase the flow of calcium through a cation channel formed in plasma membranes. Mutations of PKD1 are more common than mutations of PKD2 (accounting for 85 percent of cases), are likely to be associated with more renal cysts, and lead to earlier development of renal insufficiency (on average 20 years earlier) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-and-mechanisms-of-cyst-growth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and mechanisms of cyst growth&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The renal manifestations, ex-utero diagnosis, and course of this disorder are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasound appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, the kidneys appear normal prenatally. The rarely seen prenatal presentation of ADPKD is characterized by moderately enlarged kidneys (1 to 2 standard deviations above the mean size for gestational age) with a hyperechogenic cortex. The medulla can be hypoechogenic or hyperechogenic. A hypoechogenic medulla resulting in increased corticomedullary differentiation was reported in 25 of 27 (77 percent) prenatally diagnosed cases; absent or decreased corticomedullary differentiation with hyperechoic medulla was less frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Cysts are seen in approximately 15 percent of prenatal cases, and are usually in a cortical location. Very rarely, one kidney may be larger than the other, suggesting unilateral disease. </p><p>The ultrasonographic appearance of the kidneys may not allow certain differentiation of autosomal recessive from autosomal dominant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, ARPKD kidneys in utero are hyperechoic and display &quot;decreased&quot; corticomedullary differentiation because of the hyperechoic medulla. In comparison, ADPKD kidneys in utero tend to be moderately enlarged with a hyperechoic cortex and relatively hypoechoic medulla causing &quot;increased&quot; corticomedullary differentiation. In addition, high-resolution ultrasound may detect the dilatations of branching collecting ducts in ARPKD that are tubular and are readily distinguished from the round cysts of ADPKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Renal ultrasound evaluation of the parents may be useful for differential diagnosis. If either parent has ADPKD, the finding of enlarged echogenic kidneys with or without cysts in the fetus strongly supports the diagnosis. Absence of cysts in the parents (particularly if they are &gt;30 years of age) suggests ARPKD rather than ADPKD. However, it is important to note that in 5 to 10 percent of patients, ADPKD can result from de novo mutations. In addition, a negative (normal) ultrasound in a fetus at risk provides no reassurance of absence of ADPKD because of the variability in ultrasound findings and late presentation of this disorder.</p><p>Amniotic fluid volume is usually normal since normal nephrons are present; this is an important distinction from ARPKD. In a report of 27 prenatally diagnosed cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], amniotic fluid volume was normal in 89 percent, slightly diminished in 7 percent, and increased initially, but with secondary normalization in one case (4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Associated structural abnormalities, such as cysts in the liver and spleen, have not been identified prenatally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Obstetric management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ADPKD is associated with a normal karyotype; therefore, chromosome studies are not useful for confirming the diagnosis. The disease is unknown to the family in over 50 percent of parents at the time of obstetric ultrasound. If fetal ADPKD is suspected and not known to be inherited in the family, then the parents should be assessed by ultrasound evaluation of their kidneys and liver, as renal compromise may not occur until later in life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Confirmation of the diagnosis is possible by molecular DNA studies, which can be obtained from fetal DNA either through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. The majority of cases (approximately 90 percent) are inherited; few cases are due to de novo mutations. Although linkage-based diagnostic approaches are feasible in large families, direct mutation screening is generally more applicable. As ADPKD displays a high level of allelic heterogeneity, complete screening of both genes is required. Screening of individuals with ADPKD detects mutations in up to 91 percent of cases. However, only approximately 65 percent of patients have definite mutations, with approximately 26 percent having indefinite changes that require further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing'</a>.) </p><p>Although renal function is preserved and the amniotic fluid volume remains normal in most cases, prenatal presentation may be associated with more rapid progression of the disease after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In one study of patients diagnosed prenatally, 43 percent died within the first year of life, 3 percent developed renal failure by age three years, and 67 percent developed hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Primitive nephrons filled with urine are the basis of the multiple cysts, which are seen initially at the periphery of the kidney. The kidney is enlarged and the overall shape is abnormal. The affected kidney is nonfunctional and frequently undergoes involution when the cysts shrink from absence of urine production. This leads to a picture similar to renal agenesis.

No normal renal tissue is apparent on ultrasound. The appearance of multiple large cysts in the paravertebral area has been likened to a cluster of grapes. The kidney is usually enlarged with an irregular nonreniform outline, and no visible renal pelvis. The ureter is atretic or absent. The renal artery is small or absent in MCDK and the Doppler waveform, when present, is markedly abnormal with reduced systolic peak and absent diastolic flow.</p><p>Amniotic fluid volume is normal with unilateral disease. Bilateral disease results in absent urine production, absence of bladder filling, and severe oligohydramnios that leads to pulmonary hypoplasia. The kidneys may be enlarged early in pregnancy, but often there is a decrease in size as pregnancy progresses; the kidneys can become severely shrunken (terminal phase).

Aneuploidy is much less common in isolated unilateral MCDK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], but pathogenic copy number variants appear to be common (16.7 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]) so amniocentesis for microarray on amniocytes should be offered.</p><p>Careful examination of the contralateral kidney is important in determining the prognosis. In unilateral disease, conservative management with periodic ultrasound assessment is sufficient. Children with isolated unilateral MCDK with a normal contralateral kidney have good long-term outcomes with normal renal function, infrequent urinary tract infections, and compensatory contralateral renal hypertrophy. Routine removal of the multicystic kidney is no longer recommended because the long-term risks of hypertension and infection are low and the risk of malignancy is not increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Since nephrogenesis is completed in the third trimester, an early diagnosis can represent a false-positive result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Serial scans may be helpful to assess the amniotic fluid volume and the appearance of the kidneys in such cases. However, prenatal ultrasound alone cannot predict etiology or long-term outcome in the absence of family history, postmortem, or postnatal data. In general, normal or slightly increased kidney size and normal amniotic fluid volume predict a good outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The ultrasonographic differential diagnosis of enlarged hyperechogenic kidneys, with or without cysts, includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ARPKD (significantly enlarged kidneys with reniform shape, loss of corticomedullary differentiation, subcortical hypoechoic rim, cysts [if present] predominantly in the medulla, reduced amniotic fluid volume)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ADPKD (kidneys moderately enlarged, amniotic fluid volume usually normal, cysts [if present] usually in cortical location, but rarely presents in the prenatal period)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive dysplasia (hyperechogenic kidneys, renal cortical cysts with dilated upper or lower urinary tract)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multicystic dysplasia (usually unilateral, reniform shape not preserved, kidney enlarged by randomly distributed large size cysts that do not connect).

Prenatal sonographic characteristics include normal size or slightly enlarged kidneys with normal amniotic fluid volume or polyhydramnios, probably due to polyuria. Cortical or diffuse renal cysts may accompany prenatal presentation and develop in more than 90 percent of cases in the postnatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].

For example, in one study, MRI of two fetuses with enlarged hyperechoic kidneys showed localized medullary hyperintense lesions suggesting ARPKD in one fetus and medullary cystic dysplasia in the other fetus with Jeune's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-sonographic-diagnosis-of-cystic-renal-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal cystic kidney disease is one of the major causes of end stage renal disease in children and adults. Bilateral polycystic kidneys in a fetus should prompt investigation of the kidneys in the rest of the family. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Autosomal dominant polycystic renal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal cystic kidney disease presents with hyperechogenic kidneys with or without cysts on prenatal ultrasound and warrant a thorough anatomical examination, family history, and genetic counseling and testing, as appropriate. Once nonhereditary dysplastic lesions and renal cystic <span class=\"nowrap\">tumors/cysts</span> are ruled out, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), autosomal dominant kidney disease (ADPKD), and syndromic origins should be investigated. However, prenatal ultrasound alone should not be expected to predict etiology or long-term outcome in the absence of family history or postmortem or postnatal data. In general, normal or slightly increased kidney size and normal amniotic fluid volume indicate a good outcome. (See <a href=\"#H2284604749\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for cystic renal disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4534637\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic work-up and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The predominant prenatal ultrasound feature of ARPKD is uniform, massive enlargement of the kidneys bilaterally with preservation of the reniform shape and loss of corticomedullary differentiation. The sonographic features can initially appear at any time during gestation, including the third trimester. A hyperechogenic appearance of the kidneys with normal amniotic fluid volume in the first trimester may be an early indication of this disorder. In the second trimester, there is usually massive uniform echogenic enlargement of the kidneys bilaterally associated with oligohydramnios and a small or absent bladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69859%7EOBGYN%2F79653\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69859 graphicRef79653 \">image 1A-B</a>). Serial ultrasound examinations that confirm progressive enlargement and reduction in amniotic fluid volume help establish the diagnosis. However, hyperechogenicity and elongation of the kidney may be the only ultrasound finding until the third trimester in rare cases. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound appearance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical clinical presentation of ADPKD is in the third to fifth decade of life. The kidneys appear normal prenatally in most cases. Rarely, the fetal kidneys appear enlarged and echogenic with a reniform shape and usually increased corticomedullary differentiation. If either parent has ADPKD, the finding of enlarged echogenic kidneys in the fetus strongly suggests the diagnosis. A negative (normal) ultrasound in a fetus at risk provides only limited reassurance of the absence of ADPKD because of the variability in ultrasound findings and late presentation of this disorder. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound appearance'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) can be unilateral or bilateral and presents with randomly located renal cysts that do not connect. The contralateral kidney has an abnormality in one third of unilateral cases. Extrarenal malformations are noted in 15 to 25 percent of MCDK cases. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Multicystic dysplastic kidney'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive dysplasia is secondary to urinary tract obstruction or reflux and presents with hyperechogenic kidneys with or without cysts and a dilated urinary tract. (See <a href=\"#H4534535\" class=\"local\">'Obstructive dysplasia (ORD) or cystic renal dysplasia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>HNF1B</em> mutations are the most common cause for bilateral fetal renal hyperechogenicity and present with normal size or slightly enlarged kidneys with normal amniotic fluid volume or polyhydramnios. Cortical or diffuse renal cysts may accompany prenatal presentation.
