Approximately 10 to 15 percent of adults and adolescents have symptoms consistent with IBS, and although not all individuals with IBS seek medical care, patients with IBS make up a significant percentage of all outpatient visits to gastroenterologists and other healthcare providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the management of IBS. Our recommendations are largely consistent with the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Patients with IBS may benefit from exclusion of gas-producing foods; a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs); and in select cases, lactose and gluten avoidance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90186\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90186 \">table 1</a>). There is insufficient evidence to support routine food allergy testing in patients with IBS. </p><p>Both a low FODMAP diet and a strict traditional IBS diet improve IBS symptoms. In a randomized trial, 75 patients with IBS were assigned to a low FODMAP diet or a more traditional IBS diet (regular meal pattern; avoidance of large meals; reduced intake of fat, insoluble fibers, caffeine, and gas-producing foods such as beans, cabbage, and onions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Note the traditional diet did include some food restriction of high FODMAP foods. At the end of the four-week trial, there was a significant reduction in IBS symptom severity in both dietary groups as compared with baseline. However, there was no significant difference in the reduction of symptom severity or the proportion of responders between the two groups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86846729\"><span class=\"h3\">Exclusion of gas-producing foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with IBS should be advised to exclude foods that increase flatulence (eg, beans, onions, celery, carrots, raisins, bananas, apricots, prunes, Brussels sprouts, wheat germ, pretzels, and bagels), alcohol, and caffeine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Underlying visceral hypersensitivity may explain the exaggerated discomfort experienced by patients with IBS with the consumption of gas-producing foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

We also suggest an empiric trial of a lactose-free diet in patients who complain of persistent abdominal bloating despite exclusion of gas-producing foods. As improvement of symptoms does not necessarily imply lactose maldigestion, the diagnosis of lactose intolerance can be confirmed with breath testing in patients who do not want to be on a lactose-restricted diet in the long term without clear evidence of maldigestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Individuals who have no evidence of lactose intolerance on breath test but who have symptoms with ingestion of milk may have intolerance to other milk components (eg, cow milk protein) and may tolerate milk from other mammals or ingestion of soy.

Patients with undiagnosed lactose intolerance can have lasting clinical improvement when placed on a lactose-restricted diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

These short-chain carbohydrates are poorly absorbed and are osmotically active in the intestinal lumen where they are rapidly fermented, resulting in symptoms of abdominal bloating and pain. A low FODMAP diet involves elimination of a larger number of high FODMAP foods that would not be excluded in a diet that only required avoidance of gas-producing foods (eg, foods that contain fructose, including honey, high-fructose corn syrup, apples, pears, mangoes, cherries, or oligosaccharides, including wheat). Low FODMAP dietary education should be provided by a trained dietician to avoid unnecessary dietary over-restriction and a nutritionally replete diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Low FODMAP education consists of initially eliminating FODMAPs from the diet for six to eight weeks and then, following symptom resolution, gradual reintroduction of foods high in fermentable carbohydrates to determine individual tolerance to specific fermentable carbohydrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Studies have demonstrated an improvement in IBS symptoms with FODMAP restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. In a randomized, single-blind, crossover trial, 30 patients with IBS and 8 healthy controls were assigned to 21 days of a diet low in FODMAPs or a moderate FODMAP Australian diet followed by a 21-day washout period before crossing over to an alternate diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Subjects with IBS, but not controls, had significantly lower overall gastrointestinal symptoms scores with an improvement in scores for abdominal pain, bloating, flatulence, and dissatisfaction with stool consistency while on a low FODMAP diet as compared with the moderate FODMAP diet and their diet at baseline. In another randomized trial 92 patients with IBS-D were assigned to a four week trial of a low FODMAP diet or modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence dietary recommendations (small frequent meals, avoid trigger foods, and avoid excess alcohol and caffeine). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients reporting adequate relief of IBS-D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, the low FODMAP group exhibited significantly higher rates of improvement in pain (51 versus 23 percent) and greater reductions in average daily scores for abdominal pain, bloating, stool consistency, frequency, and urgency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86846919\"><span class=\"h3\">Gluten avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gluten has been demonstrated to alter bowel barrier functions in patients with IBS-D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) has been hypothesized as an underlying mechanism for symptom generation in patients with IBS but evidence to support gluten avoidance in patients with IBS has been conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. </p><p>It is feasible that symptomatic improvement associated with a gluten-free diet may not be caused by removal of the gluten protein, but rather the reduction of fructans. In a randomized double blind crossover trial, 59 patients with self-reported NCGS were assigned to diets containing gluten (without fructan), fructan (without gluten), or placebo for seven days followed by a minimum one week washout period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thirteen patients met Rome III criteria for IBS. Overall gastrointestinal symptom rating scores and bloating, were significantly higher with fructan exposure as compared with gluten. There was no significant difference in symptom scores between gluten and placebo groups. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome#H17284916\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome&quot;, section on 'Gluten sensitivity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Fiber</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of fiber in patients with IBS is controversial, but given the absence of serious side effects and potential benefit, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/ispaghula</span> should be considered in patients with IBS whose predominant symptom is constipation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/18,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,26,27</a>]. As some patients may experience increased bloating and gas, we suggest a starting dose of psyllium of one-half to one tablespoon daily. The dose should then be slowly titrated up based on response to treatment.</p><p>A 2011 systematic review that included 12 studies found no beneficial effect for bulking agents over placebo in improving abdominal pain, global assessment or symptom scores. On subgroup analyses, there was no significant benefit with either soluble or insoluble fiber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, another meta-analysis that pooled data from the same trials and used a combined endpoint for abdominal pain and global IBS symptoms demonstrated that in six trials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a> was associated with a small improvement in symptoms as compared with placebo with a number needed to treat to prevent one patient with IBS remaining symptomatic of six (RR of persistent symptoms 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Although it is possible that food allergy has a role in the development of symptoms, there are also no reliable means to identify such individuals. Testing for serum immunoglobulins directed at specific dietary antigens and elimination of responsible foods has been proposed, but the relationship between results of such testing and improvement of symptoms requires additional study before such an approach can be recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Other methods used in evaluating food allergies (eg, skin prick testing, RAST testing, and atopy patch testing) have not been well studied in IBS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64583454\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical activity should be advised in patients with IBS given a potential benefit with regard to IBS symptoms and the general health benefits of exercise. In a randomized trial, 102 patients with IBS were assigned to increased physical activity or maintenance of current activity levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Increased physical activity composed 20 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity three to five days per week. The amount of physical activity prescribed was determined in part by the patient's baseline level of activity. Seventy-five patients completed the study (38 in the physical activity arm and 37 in the control arm). After 12 weeks, there was a trend toward more patients in the physical activity arm showing clinical improvement in the severity of IBS symptoms as compared with the control group (43 versus 26 percent, p = 0.07). In addition, patients in the physical activity arm were significantly less likely to have worsening of their IBS symptoms as compared with controls (8 versus 23 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUNCTIVE PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We treat patients with moderate to severe symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that impair quality of life with pharmacologic agents. Since IBS generally presents as a complex of symptoms, treatment should be based on the predominant symptom<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>subtype. We make incremental changes in therapy at two- to four-week intervals. (See <a href=\"#H29866719\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>Randomized trials evaluating specific pharmacologic agents have demonstrated their superiority as compared with placebo. However, there have been few controlled trials evaluating specific strategies for how these drugs should be used in conjunction with other types of treatment (eg, fiber therapy), how long they should be used, or whether they should be given continuously or as needed. We often use pharmacologic intervention to control symptom flares (eg, antidiarrheals) but also use continuous pharmacologic therapy (eg, tricyclic antidepressant drugs) for periods of months or years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23037175\"><span class=\"h2\">Constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with IBS with constipation (IBS-C) who have failed a trial of soluble fiber (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/ispaghula),</span> we suggest polyethylene glycol (PEG).

For weeks 1 through 26, a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving eluxadoline (100 mg twice daily) achieved the primary endpoint as compared with placebo in both trials (29 versus 19 percent; 33 versus 20 percent). The most common adverse events associated with eluxadoline were nausea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Pancreatitis developed in 0.3 percent of patients treated with eluxadoline.

(See <a href=\"#H29866719\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with IBS, it is important to assess for alarm features that may require additional endoscopic evaluation. Alarm features include more than minimal rectal bleeding, weight loss, unexplained iron deficiency anemia, nocturnal symptoms, and a family history of organic diseases including colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac sprue. (See <a href=\"#H106780806\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishment of the clinician-patient relationship and continuity of care are critical to the management of all patients with IBS. In patients with mild and intermittent symptoms, we suggest not using pharmacologic therapy for initial management (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We begin with lifestyle and dietary modification (eg, exclusion of gas-producing foods; a diet low in fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols [FODMAPs]; and in select cases, lactose and gluten avoidance) and a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a> in patients with IBS with constipation (IBS-C). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with mild to moderate symptoms who fail to respond to lifestyle and dietary modification and in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of IBS that affect quality of life, we use pharmacologic therapy as adjunctive treatment. Since IBS presents as a complex of symptoms, pharmacologic treatment should be based on the predominant symptom with incremental changes in therapy at two- to four-week intervals. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with IBS-C who fail a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a>, we recommend polyethylene glycol (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lubiprostone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lubiprostone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linaclotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linaclotide</a> in patients with symptoms of constipation that are refractory to osmotic laxatives (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with abdominal pain due to IBS, we use antispasmodics on an as-needed basis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in anticipation of stressors with known exacerbating effects. We reserve the use of antidepressants to patients with persistent abdominal pain despite antispasmodics and those with coexisting depression. (See <a href=\"#H8035362\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal pain and bloating'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with diarrhea-predominant symptoms, we use antidiarrheals as initial treatment and use bile acid sequestrants as second-line therapy. Given the modest benefit and relatively short-term follow-up demonstrated in the trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifaximin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifaximin</a>, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using antibiotics routinely in patients with IBS (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We reserve a two-week trial of rifaximin for patients with moderate to severe IBS without constipation, particularly those with bloating, who have failed to respond to other therapies, including a low FODMAP diet, bile acid sequestrants, antispasmodics, and tricyclic antidepressants. (See <a href=\"#H8035540\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H86846749\" class=\"local\">'Low FODMAP diet'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with refractory symptoms should be carefully reassessed, paying specific attention to the type of ongoing symptoms, the degree to which symptoms have changed, compliance with medications, and the presence of any alarm features. (See <a href=\"#H2957158\" class=\"local\">'Refractory symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H106780806\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Peery AF, Dellon ES, Lund J, et al.
