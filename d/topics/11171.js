The treatment combines the clinical application of mindfulness meditation with elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and was first developed in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>This topic reviews the use of mindfulness based cognitive therapy for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent unipolar major depression, as well as patients with acute episodes of unipolar major depression or with residual depressive symptoms. Choosing initial treatment for patients with unipolar depression and choosing treatment for resistant depression are discussed separately.

Mindfulness is purposeful, nonjudgmental attention to the present moment, which is developed through meditation and other practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. CBT is based upon the theory that maladaptive thoughts and behaviors lead to psychopathology; the clinician addresses these dysfunctional cognitions and the patient tries to change the resulting problematic behaviors.</p><p>There are similarities between mindfulness based cognitive therapy and CBT. Both treatments teach patients to identify triggers and symptoms of relapse, and to develop a behavior plan for avoiding relapse. Other similarities include directing patients to observe their thoughts and to rate activities for the pleasure and sense of mastery they provide. </p><p>Both treatments also address dysfunctional, ruminative, and depressogenic thoughts (eg, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so weak&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve let others down&rdquo;) that are induced by distressing events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. During an acute episode of major depression, the patient experiences dysphoria and dysfunctional thoughts, along with other symptoms. Some studies suggest a connection develops between dysphoria and dysfunctional thoughts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. Following remission, something distressing may induce sadness, which may then reactivate self-criticism and other dysfunctional thoughts about inadequacy and failure, even if they are not relevant to the current situation. Patients may believe their remission is threatened and ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with me?&rdquo; This rumination may lead to a cascade of thoughts and emotions that results in relapse of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>What distinguishes mindfulness based cognitive therapy is its emphasis upon accepting dysfunctional thoughts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The clinical significance of these changes may be related to findings from other studies that suggest mindfulness meditation addresses biased attention to negative life events and impairments in emotion regulation, each of which are each putative risk factors for relapse of depressive episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Results from neurobiologic and neuropsychologic studies of mindfulness meditation include the following: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroimaging studies have found that meditation may possibly be associated with functional and structural brain changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/17,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,21</a>]. As an example, a randomized trial compared mindfulness meditation training with relaxation training in 35 individuals who were unemployed and experiencing stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Both training programs were conducted at a residential center over three days. Magnetic resonance imaging found that resting state functional connectivity (communication) between the posterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (within the default mode network) increased with meditation training, but not relaxation training. In addition, the four-month follow-up assessment found that circulating levels of interleukin-6 (a biomarker of systemic inflammation) decreased in the group that received meditation training, and increased in the group that received relaxation training. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of 23 controlled or case-controlled studies found that mindfulness meditation may enhance attention, memory, and some executive functions (such as response inhibition) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p/><p>Additional information about neural networks and peripheral inflammatory markers is discussed separately in the context of unipolar depression.

Prior to this interview, the patient should read a handout (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F61850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61850 \">table 1</a>) that explains that the therapy is a maintenance treatment for depression, that homework is part of the treatment, and the difficulty of facing unpleasant emotions and thoughts.</p><p>In determining whether the patient is appropriate for mindfulness based cognitive therapy, the clinician should confirm that the patient has suffered multiple episodes of unipolar major depression; the evidence suggests that the therapy is effective for patients with a history of at least three episodes. In addition, the patient should have recovered from the most recent episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The Patient Health Questionnaire &ndash; Nine Item (PHQ-9) is a well-validated, widely used, self-report measure that can facilitate assessment of the patient&rsquo;s current depressive status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">form 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Patients with residual symptoms may be suitable, depending upon the specific nature of the symptoms. Suicidal patients without any other treatment are not appropriate for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. In addition, it is critical to ascertain if attention and concentration are intact, with both the interview (eg, &ldquo;Is reading a problem? Can you concentrate for long periods of time? Can you follow the plot while watching a movie?&rdquo;) and mental status examination. </p><p>In assessing the patient&rsquo;s commitment to attend the weekly sessions and complete the daily homework, the clinician should discuss the value of persisting with treatment if results are not immediately apparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. An analogy can be offered that training one&rsquo;s cognition is like training a muscle; it takes practice. Similarly, depressed patients often have to take an antidepressant medication for several weeks before they notice any benefit. The intention is to enable patients to estimate their readiness for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, rather than to persuade them to enroll.</p><p>Logistical and practical aspects of treatment are also discussed during the individual interview, including the policy for tardiness, missed appointments, and payment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26977540\"><span class=\"h1\">DELIVERING MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mindfulness based cognitive therapy is a group program that combines training in mindfulness meditation with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques. The therapy is based upon a treatment manual (book) that describes how the therapy is structured and standardizes the procedures that are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Each of the eight sessions, as well as the homework to be completed in between sessions, is described in detail to help clinicians implement the treatment and maintain consistency.

This limits the treatment&rsquo;s availability, but is intended to control its quality; our experience is that the poorest outcomes seem to result from clinicians teaching mindfulness without practicing it themselves. During mindfulness meditation, patients encounter difficulties or confusion about what is expected. Clinicians who have not experienced these challenges appear less able to help patients manage them and continue treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/5,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27</a>].

If the two treatments are provided by different clinicians, they need to work together as members of the same treatment team. This should include an agreement with each other and the patient that the two clinicians will share any concerns they have and not keep secrets. Patients commonly tell the clinician providing mindfulness based cognitive therapy that they wish to discontinue their antidepressants; these patients should be redirected to the clinician prescribing the medication. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2077158\"><span class=\"h2\">Format</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mindfulness based cognitive therapy is typically a group program consisting of eight weekly sessions, each lasting two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/5,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,31</a>]. The group typically includes 8 to 15 patients. The skills learned during the sessions are practiced daily in between sessions for up to one hour. </p><p>In addition, an online, web-based version of mindfulness based cognitive therapy that delivers the content in eight sessions has been developed for patients with limited access to the treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259630147\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each session focuses upon learning mindfulness meditation and CBT concepts and skills within a group setting. </p><p>Meditation and other practices are used to develop mindfulness, ie, purposeful attention to the present moment. Patients learn to observe their thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations with curiosity and without criticizing themselves or passing judgement upon what is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Sitting meditation often focuses upon breathing and the sensations of respiration. Another mindfulness practice is the body scan, which involves paying attention to different parts of the body and noticing any tension, pain, bracing, or numbing. Mindfulness is also practiced while patients stretch or walk. Each of these practices typically last for 40 minutes, but others are shorter (eg, Three-Minute Coping Breathing Space, a technique for managing rumination about a problem, and the Three-Minute Breathing Space, a technique for connecting with the present moment). In addition, mindfulness is practiced with everyday activities such as eating.</p><p>Mindfulness based cognitive therapy makes use of CBT techniques that include prescribing homework and teaching patients about depressive symptoms, dysfunctional thoughts that frequently accompany depression, and how thoughts can affect the emotional impact of an event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The clinician also describes the CBT model of thoughts and feelings (ABC: Antecedent, Behavior, and Consequence). In addition, patients create a behavior plan to prevent relapse, which includes a list of both activating, pleasurable activities and habitual dysfunctional thoughts, as well as a letter that the patient addresses to <span class=\"nowrap\">him/herself</span> explaining the importance of staying active, reducing self-criticism, and giving oneself credit for successes. </p><p>The group format provides several therapeutic benefits, including mutual support and decreased isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, patients learn from each other as they discuss their struggles with depression and dysfunctional thoughts, and their difficulties with developing attentional focus. </p><p>The last session addresses termination. The clinician asks patients to speak candidly about what they have learned, encourages them to practice mindfulness after the group meetings stop, and helps patients say goodbye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, the clinician gives each patient a small object, such as a marble or small polished stone, to remind patients of the other group members and their shared emotional experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2077024\"><span class=\"h2\">Managing clinical deterioration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If depressive symptoms recur during mindfulness based cognitive therapy, the clinician should assess the patient outside of the group setting to determine whether and how the treatment plan should be modified. If clinical deterioration occurs because the patient misses group sessions or does not complete homework assignments, the clinician and patient should decide whether the patient can recommit to the treatment, or whether alternative treatment is indicated. Alternative treatment may also be indicated if the patient is adhering to mindfulness-based cognitive therapy but is not responding; options include adding pharmacotherapy, or switching to pharmacotherapy or a different psychotherapy such as interpersonal psychotherapy. Another option is to join a new mindfulness-based cognitive therapy group after the patient has improved with alternative treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Treatment of resistant depression&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Support for continuing mindfulness based cognitive therapy for patients with subsyndromal symptoms comes from a randomized trial that compared mindfulness-based cognitive therapy with placebo pill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Some patients suffered symptoms that did not meet full criteria for major depression; these symptoms were less likely to progress to a full-blown episode in patients receiving therapy. In another study, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy may have improved residual depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26977547\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTINUING CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of mindfulness based cognitive therapy is to teach skills that patients will use beyond treatment termination. The risk for recurrence of major depression persists for years after recovery from an episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], and patients are thus encouraged to practice mindfulness indefinitely (much as hypertensive patients are vigilant for high-sodium foods). Several resources are available to support the ongoing practice of mindfulness. (See <a href=\"#H2241279\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, some programs include monthly follow-up sessions (&ldquo;graduate classes&rdquo;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. These sessions typically include a 30-minute sitting meditation focusing upon the breath, along with 30 minutes of mindful stretching or walking. The discussion afterwards addresses the challenges of practicing mindfulness, with less emphasis on therapeutic problem solving.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26977554\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE OF EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mindfulness based cognitive therapy has primarily been used to delay or prevent recurrences of unipolar major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/15,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,37</a>]. In addition, the therapy may also reduce residual symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is beneficial for the treatment of unipolar major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], but it is not clear that mindfulness meditation provides any additional benefit because no high quality studies have compared mindfulness based cognitive therapy with CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/19,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,40</a>]. One poor-quality trial compared mindfulness based cognitive therapy plus antidepressant, CBT plus antidepressant, and antidepressant alone in 90 patients with unipolar major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The two psychotherapies were superior to antidepressant alone and comparable with each other. </p><p>However, indirect support for adding mindfulness meditation to CBT includes randomized trials that compared mindfulness meditation alone with active interventions that controlled for nonspecific aspects such as the amount of time and attention provided to patients. A meta-analysis of five trials (n = 499 depressed patients) found a significant, clinically small effect favoring meditation over active controls, three to six months after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17845362\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventing recurrences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For euthymic patients with a history of recurrent major depressive episodes, randomized maintenance trials suggest that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy can delay or prevent additional recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/15,37,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,37,42</a>]. A pooled analysis of patient-level data from nine randomized trials compared mindfulness based cognitive therapy with a control condition (usual care or active treatment) in patients with recurrent major depression who were currently remitted (n &gt;1200) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. During 60 weeks of follow-up, recurrences of major depression were observed in fewer patients who received mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, compared with controls (38 versus 49 percent). In addition, patients with higher levels of residual depressive symptoms were less likely to relapse with the psychotherapy than controls. The effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy was independent of sociodemographic factors (eg, age, sex, marital status, and socioeconomic status) and psychiatric variables (eg, age at onset of depression and number of previous major depressive episodes); this suggests that the psychotherapy is useful for a broad range of patients. The study found no evidence of adverse events associated with mindfulness based cognitive therapy when delivered by well-trained teachers in a clinical context.</p><p>There may be a dose response relationship, such that the benefit of mindfulness based cognitive therapy is influenced by the number of days per week that patients practice mediation. A prospective study included patients (n = 99) who were assigned to mindfulness based cognitive therapy as part of an eight week randomized trial, and subsequently followed for up to one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. During the eight-week trial, the frequency of daily meditation sessions was monitored. Relapse of depression over the one-year follow-up occurred in fewer patients who meditated for three or more <span class=\"nowrap\">days/week</span> during the eight-week protocol, compared with patients who practiced on fewer days (39 versus 58 percent). Each meditation session should last a minimum of approximately 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>However, the efficacy of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for maintenance treatment of major depression may in part be due to nonspecific factors (eg, attention) as well as the meditation and education about dysfunctional thoughts that occurs during therapy. In a randomized trial, 180 remitted patients with a history of recurrent depressive episodes were assigned to either cognitive-behavioral therapy that included mindfulness meditation exercises, or to education about depression (symptoms, course, pharmacotherapy and adherence, prodromal signs, and managing recurrence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Both treatments were administered in 16 sessions over 8 months, and patients were then followed for another 12 months. Time to recurrence was comparable for the two groups (approximately 1.5 years).</p><p>Psychotherapy trials, like pharmacotherapy trials, are methodologically variable. Rigorous psychotherapy trials specify a priori hypotheses and analytic tests, use active psychotherapy comparators that control for the nonspecific aspects of psychotherapy, use standardized diagnostic criteria and outcome measures, carefully blind outcome ratings, develop manuals for the psychotherapies that are studied and measure the clinician&rsquo;s adherence, and stratify patients on predetermined risk variables. Less meticulous studies use open-label designs, less rigorous comparators (eg, treatment as usual or waiting lists), or fail to adequately blind outcome ratings. Although it is commonly believed that blinding of patients in psychotherapy trials is less successful compared with pharmacotherapy trials, this has never been studied.</p><p>Meta-analyses appear to overestimate the clinical effect of nearly all psychotherapies that are used to treat depression because of publication bias and study quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].</p><p>Additional information about continuation and maintenance treatment for unipolar depression is discussed separately.

However, in many studies that attempted to evaluate the efficacy of monotherapy with mindfulness based cognitive therapy, some of the patients treated with mindfulness based cognitive therapy also received antidepressants.</p><p>Evidence that suggests mindfulness based cognitive therapy is perhaps superior to pharmacotherapy for maintenance treatment of unipolar major depression includes a meta-analysis of patient-level data from four randomized maintenance trials (number of patients not reported) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The analysis compared mindfulness based cognitive therapy with antidepressants alone in patients with recurrent major depression who were currently remitted and followed for up to 60 weeks. At the time of enrollment, many patients were treated with maintenance antidepressants; although patients assigned to psychotherapy received support in discontinuing antidepressants and many succeeded in doing so, other patients continued their antidepressants at reduced or full doses. Recurrence of major depression was 23 percent less likely to occur in patients who received mindfulness based cognitive therapy, compared with patients treated with antidepressants alone (hazard ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.98). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2240063\"><span class=\"h3\">Mindfulness based cognitive therapy plus treatment as usual compared with treatment as usual alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance treatment with mindfulness based cognitive therapy plus treatment as usual may possibly be more effective than treatment as usual alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/15,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,37</a>]. A meta-analysis examined four randomized trials (326 patients in remission from unipolar major depression) that compared combination treatment with treatment as usual alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The trials either required a history of at least three depressive episodes, or stratified for randomization based upon number of prior episodes (two versus more than two) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/28-30,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30,50</a>]. Treatment as usual consisted of instructions for patients to contact their primary care or mental health clinician if symptomatic deterioration occurred. The meta-analysis found that for patients with a history of at least three depressive episodes, relapse occurred in fewer patients who received the combination compared with treatment as usual alone (32 versus 60 percent); heterogeneity was mild to moderate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In addition, it&rsquo;s not clear whether mindfulness based cognitive therapy provided any specific effects because the randomized trials did not control for the additional attention it conferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p>In addition, the meta-analysis found that for patients with only two prior episodes of major depression (total of 50 patients), adding mindfulness based cognitive therapy to treatment as usual provided no additional benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The small number of patients with two episodes and the lower rate of recurrence in patients with a more benign history probably contributed to this finding, although it is possible that patients with a history of two episodes do not derive the same benefit as do patients with at least three episodes.</p><p>A subsequent eight-week randomized trial compared mindfulness-based cognitive therapy plus treatment as usual with treatment as usual alone in 205 patients with three or more prior episodes of unipolar major depression (66 percent had recovered from their most recent episode, 34 percent were still symptomatic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There were significantly fewer depressive symptoms at the end of treatment in patients who received mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and results were comparable for euthymic patients and patients with depressive symptoms at study entry. &#160; &#160;</p><p>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy can also help perinatal depression. A randomized trial compared mindfulness based cognitive therapy plus treatment as usual with treatment as usual alone in pregnant women with a prior history of unipolar major depression (n = 86) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The use of pharmacotherapy or other psychotherapies was permitted in both groups. Recurrence of major depression during pregnancy or the postpartum period occurred in fewer patients who received active treatment than patients who received treatment as usual alone (18 versus 50 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3087466\"><span class=\"h4\">Mindfulness based cognitive therapy plus pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with a history of recurrent depressive episodes receive mindfulness based cognitive therapy plus pharmacotherapy as maintenance treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].

The therapy combines the clinical application of mindfulness meditation with elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). (See <a href=\"#H26977519\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H26977526\" class=\"local\">'Theoretical foundation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mindfulness based cognitive therapy is indicated for maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent episodes of unipolar major depression who are currently remitted, as well as patients with either acute episodes of major depression or residual depressive symptoms. The therapy can be used alone or in conjunction with pharmacotherapy. However, the treatment is contraindicated for patients with impaired attention and concentration, active suicidal ideation and no other current maintenance treatment, or a history of untreated trauma. (See <a href=\"#H2239853\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2240511\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mindfulness is purposeful, nonjudgmental attention to the thoughts and feelings that occur each moment. CBT is based upon the theory that maladaptive thoughts and behaviors lead to psychopathology; the clinician addresses these dysfunctional cognitions and the patient tries to change the resulting problematic behaviors. (See <a href=\"#H26977526\" class=\"local\">'Theoretical foundation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mindfulness meditation may possibly be associated with functional and structural brain changes in areas involved with attention, emotional regulation, and self-awareness. The clinical significance of these changes may be related to findings from other studies that suggest meditation addresses biased attention to negative life events and impairments in emotion regulation, each of which are each putative risk factors for relapse of depressive episodes. (See <a href=\"#H3324297606\" class=\"local\">'Neurobiology and neuropsychology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should assess the prospective patient&rsquo;s current clinical status, prior course of illness, and commitment to attend the eight two-hour weekly sessions and complete the daily homework. (See <a href=\"#H26977533\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mindfulness based cognitive therapy interventions include meditation, the body scan, and mindfulness while stretching or walking. The therapy also uses some CBT techniques, which include learning about depressive symptoms and dysfunctional thoughts, and creating a behavior plan to prevent relapse. (See <a href=\"#H259630147\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Randomized trials suggest that for euthymic patients with a history of recurrent, unipolar major depressive episodes, mindfulness based cognitive therapy can delay or prevent recurrence. In addition, the therapy can benefit patients with acute episodes of major depression or residual depressive symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H26977554\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy-as-maintenance-treatment-for-unipolar-major-depression/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Segal ZV, Kennedy S, Gemar M, et al.
