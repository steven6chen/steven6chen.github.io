The value of EBM is heightened in light of the following considerations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The volume of evidence available to guide clinical decisions continues to grow at a rapid pace (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110428\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110428 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improvements in research design, clinical measurements, and methods for analyzing data have led to a better understanding of how to produce valid clinical research.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite advances in research methods, many published study results are false or draw misleading conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many clinicians, even those in good standing, do not practice medicine according to the best current research evidence.</p><p/><p>The basic elements of EBM are reviewed here. They include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formulating a clinical question</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finding the best available evidence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessing the validity of the evidence (including internal and external validity)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Applying the evidence in practice, in conjunction with clinical expertise and patient preferences</p><p/><p>The focus is upon applying the results of research involving patients and clinical outcomes, such as death, disease, symptoms, and loss of function. Other kinds of evidence, such as those obtained by personal experience and laboratory studies of the pathogenesis of disease, are also useful in the care of patients but are not usually included under &quot;evidence-based medicine.&quot; EBM is meant to complement, not replace, clinical judgment in tailoring care to individual patients. Similarly, EBM and the delivery of culturally, socially, and individually sensitive and effective care are complementary, not contradictory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110429\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110429 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FORMULATING A CLINICAL QUESTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical questions are frequently complex, but it is usually wise to sharpen the focus by answering more simple questions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67164\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67164 \">table 1</a>). The question must be explicitly defined before searching for the answer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The search for the best answers to clinical questions begins with a tight, explicit formulation of the question [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For example, the question &quot;what is the best treatment for type 2 diabetes?&quot; is too general and broad to be answered well. For evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention, four questions should be considered (commonly referred to as &quot;PICO&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110430\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110430 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the relevant <strong>patient</strong> population?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What <strong>intervention</strong> is being considered?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the <strong>comparison</strong> intervention or patient population?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What <strong>outcomes</strong> are of interest?</p><p/><p>For example, an answerable relevant question may be: &quot;Among obese adults with type 2 diabetes, is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> more effective than sulfonylurea drugs in preventing death?&quot;</p><p>The approach is similar for clinical questions involving diagnosis or prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110430\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110430 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1605146383\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ultimate goal of EBM is to inform clinical decisions regarding individual patients. Ideally, therefore, one would seek answers from studies that enrolled research subjects who were very similar to one's patient. If the target population is defined too broadly, the study results may not apply to patients whose characteristics differ substantially from the typical study subject.</p><p>However, there is also some danger in defining the target population too narrowly. High-quality research of very specific groups of patients is often unavailable, and the alternative, subgroup analysis of larger, more inclusive studies can be problematic because of serious methodological concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/5-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2674511252\" class=\"local\">'External validity'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1570538204\"><span class=\"h2\">Intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In formulating the PICO question, it is important to specify the intervention being considered. A similar approach is used to evaluate questions regarding diagnosis or prognosis, in which case the question ought to clearly specify the specific diagnostic test or risk factor of interest.</p><p>As with the patient population, it is important to avoid overly narrow or broad definitions of the intervention (or test or risk factor). For questions that involve drug therapy, the dose, timing, and duration of treatment need to be considered. For example, for a middle-aged man with hypertension, one may want to know whether 81 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> taken daily and indefinitely prevents strokes. However, good data for narrowly defined treatment schedules may be unavailable, leading to a perilous reliance on subgroup analyses. Under such circumstances it may be worthwhile relaxing the definition of intervention to something broader, for example, &quot;low-dose aspirin.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2012792575\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In randomized treatment trials, the comparison group can be a placebo, usual care, or active treatment. Placebo-controlled trials have two distinct advantages: they facilitate blinding and control for the placebo effect (non-specific treatment effect). However, they do not allow one to compare the effects among real-world choices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It is important that the comparison intervention be clinically appropriate (ie, an alternative intervention that would realistically be under consideration).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1570540799\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to consider all patient-important outcomes (including benefits and harms). It is not sufficient to think of benefit (or harm) in general terms; one must be specific about the outcomes of interest. In particular, outcomes should be well-defined, measurable, reliable, sensitive to change, and should actually assess clinically relevant aspects of a patient's health.</p><p>Particular issues related to the types of outcomes measured in clinical studies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Composite endpoints</strong> &ndash; The use of a composite of multiple combined endpoints has the advantage of increasing the study's statistical power but can be difficult to interpret. Interpretation is easy if the intervention affects all component outcomes to the same extent. But when intervention effects are not consistent across the different outcomes, and the outcomes are valued differently, then interpretation of the composite is difficult. For this reason, studies that have a composite endpoint for the primary outcome should also report the results for each of the individual outcomes that make up the composite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For example, in many cardiovascular treatment studies, the outcome of death is combined with other adverse outcomes (eg, myocardial infarction, need for a revascularization procedure). Since these outcomes may be valued differently, the use of a composite outcome is confusing and inappropriate when the intervention's effect is inconsistent across the various endpoints, especially if the effects are in opposite directions. In a study comparing coronary bypass surgery with percutaneous angioplasty and stenting for severe coronary artery disease, the main study outcome was a composite of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or need for repeat revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Compared with bypass surgery, percutaneous intervention had a significantly lower risk of stroke but a significantly higher risk of repeat revascularization. The use of a combined endpoint under these circumstances would be nonsensical.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>&quot;Soft&quot; outcomes</strong> &ndash; Much of clinical research focuses on objective outcomes, which include the &quot;hard&quot; outcomes of death and disease (for example, myocardial infarction, stroke, and loss of limb). The &quot;softer&quot; outcomes that measure function, pain, and quality of life are less common, but, for many questions, are the key outcomes of interest. It is usually easy to measure the hard outcomes without the need for special instruments. On the other hand, outcomes that require subjective interpretation by patients or clinicians demand a carefully developed and validated measurement tool. Subjective outcomes are usually more susceptible to the placebo effect or expectation bias. Strategies to mitigate these errors, such as proper blinding, become critically important. But even the hard, objective outcomes are prone to bias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surrogate outcomes</strong> &ndash; Sometimes the most clinically important outcomes are difficult to measure and a surrogate outcome becomes an easier and cheaper substitute. Surrogate outcomes are expected to predict clinical benefit or harm based on epidemiologic, pathophysiologic, or other scientific evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The advantages of using surrogate outcomes rather than clinical outcomes is that studies can generally be done with fewer subjects and completed more quickly at lower cost. These advantages account for the prevalent use of surrogate outcomes in clinical research (45 percent of the new medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] between 2005 and 2012 were based on studies with surrogate outcomes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Common examples include blood pressure in trials evaluating antihypertensives and hemoglobin A1c level in trials evaluating diabetes medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the use of surrogate endpoints can lead to erroneous conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, research using surrogates can be difficult to incorporate into an overall assessment of risks and benefits because these outcomes, by definition, are only indirectly important to patients. The 2010 Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations state that surrogate endpoints should only be used if their ability to predict clinically important outcomes is conclusively documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Even well-qualified surrogates that appear to meet the IOM standards can be problematic. A sobering example is the use of hemoglobin A1c as a surrogate, or substitute, for the outcomes of diabetes treatment that are clinically important (death, disease, and dysfunction). Several therapies that demonstrated impressive reductions in hemoglobin A1c were later found to have no effect, or harm, on clinically relevant outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">FINDING THE EVIDENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2580777463\"><span class=\"h2\">EBM resources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most medical information is now rapidly accessible from computers and hand-held devices. However, skill is required to quickly find the desired information, while limiting irrelevant &quot;noise.&quot; Different approaches are required depending on the reason for seeking the information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly answering a specific clinical question, a cornerstone of EBM, requires a strategy that is fast and accurate and can be mastered by most physicians without the need for technical sophistication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping current with developments in one's field (&quot;knowledge management&quot;) is challenging and is generally not feasible without the use of a curated resource. Answering <strong>all</strong> important clinical questions by reading, appraising, and summarizing evidence would be overwhelming and simply impossible for the individual clinician. Therefore, the bulk of these tasks must be delegated to trustworthy sources. UpToDate is a resource for this purpose; many other resources are available online. However, the fact that a resource is electronic and easily accessible does not mean it is evidence-based. Wikipedia, for example, is commonly used to answer clinical questions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, Wikipedia entries can have major omissions and have been judged inadequate for the practice of EBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conducting a systematic review requires an exhaustive search of the primary data using multiple search tools. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systematic-review-and-meta-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systematic review and meta-analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Qualities of useful information sources for clinicians include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid access (within minutes) so the information can guide clinical decisions as they arise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted to the specific clinical question</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence-based, current research information</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portable</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Easy to use</p><p/><p>Within the domain of information technology, a distinction is made between a database, which is a collection of bibliographic references to medical articles (eg, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online [MEDLINE], Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL], Excerpta Medica database [EMBASE], Cochrane databases) and an access portal, which is a user interface with a built-in search engine (eg, PubMed, Ovid).</p><p>Each access portal may have access to more than one database. Access portals also may provide options for citation management and citation maps. Citation maps are networks of citation links between various articles in a database. These may be outgoing (articles cited in the bibliography of a particular paper) or incoming (other, more recent, reports that cite the index article). Exploring citation maps is thus a legitimate method of searching the literature, occasionally producing novel and helpful results.</p><p>Search filters (also called &quot;hedges,&quot; &quot;limits,&quot; &quot;strategies,&quot; and &quot;clinical queries&quot;) are predefined search terms designed for a specific purpose (eg, limiting searches to guidelines, or randomized controlled trials). These are both portal- and database-specific. Because the filters are platform-specific, results may be very different for seemingly identical searches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79723783\"><span class=\"h2\">Categories of evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence can be summarized at three levels of complexity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110435\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110435 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary (original) research</strong> &ndash; Primary research involves data that are collected from individuals or clusters of individuals, with clusters defined by physician, clinic, geographic region, or other factors. Within primary research, EBM practitioners should consider the hierarchy of evidence to minimize the risk of bias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110435\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110435 \">figure 3</a>). For studies evaluating therapy or harm, well-conducted randomized clinical trials are superior to observational studies, which are superior to unsystematic clinical observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Appropriate study design depends on the question being investigated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60667\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60667 \">figure 4</a>). Questions regarding benefits (and harms) of an intervention are best answered with randomized controlled trials; whereas questions regarding risk factors for disease and prognosis are best answered with prospective cohort studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systematic reviews</strong> &ndash; Systematic reviews are best for answering single questions (eg, the effectiveness of tight glucose control on microvascular complications of diabetes). They are more scientifically structured than traditional reviews, being explicit about how the authors attempted to find all relevant articles, judge the scientific quality of each study, and weigh evidence from multiple studies with conflicting results. These reviews pay particular attention to including all strong research, whether or not it has been published, to avoid publication bias (positive studies are preferentially published). Systemic reviews and meta-analyses are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systematic-review-and-meta-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systematic review and meta-analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Summaries and guidelines</strong> &ndash; Summaries and guidelines represent the highest level of complexity. Ideally, guidelines are a synthesis of systematic reviews, original research, clinical expertise, and patient preferences. At their best, summaries and guidelines are a comprehensive synthesis of the best available evidence, from which the guidelines themselves follow. Guidelines should therefore be based on a critical appraisal of the relevant original research and systematic reviews. The quality of published guidelines are highly variable, even among those sponsored by professional organizations, with several examples of multiple guidelines on the same topic making contradictory recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Standards for guideline development have been put forth by several organizations including the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group, the Institute of Medicine, and the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research, and Evaluation (AGREE) Collaboration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>]. These standards are endorsed by numerous organizations, including the United States National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI); the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]; the American College of Physicians; the Cochrane Collaboration; and UpToDate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The accepted standards for guideline development include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rely on systematic reviews</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade the quality of available evidence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade the strength of recommendations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Make an explicit connection between evidence and recommendations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">UpToDate uses the GRADE Working Group's approach to making recommendations.

Critical appraisal skills enhance mastery and autonomy in the practice of medicine. In addition, critical appraisal skills can help clinicians choose more wisely which information sources they use, favoring sources with explicit standards for weighing evidence. These skills can also make informal reading more efficient by making it easier to concentrate on especially strong articles and to skip weak ones. There are many opportunities to learn critical reading skills from books [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], journal articles, courses, and special sessions of professional meetings.</p><p>A number of guidelines are available that describe standards for conducting and reporting different types of studies. The set of guidelines endorsed by the <em>International Committee of Medical Journal Editors</em> can facilitate the critical appraisal of individual studies based on the type of study:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses &ndash; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] and PRISMA Protocols (PRISMA-P) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Randomized controlled trials &ndash; Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational studies &ndash; Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic and prognostic studies &ndash; Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] and Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]</p><p/><p>The focus of critical appraisal is judging both internal validity and generalizability (external validity) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62952 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1912036998\"><span class=\"h2\">Internal validity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Internal validity refers to the question of whether the results of clinical research are correct for the patients studied. Threats to internal validity include bias and chance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bias</strong> &ndash; Bias is any systematic error that can produce a misleading impression of the true effect. Randomized trials are performed with the aim of reducing bias and well-conducted trials usually have a low risk of bias. However, flaws in the conduct of clinical trials can produce biased results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential sources of bias in randomized trials include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Failure to conceal random assignment to those enrolling study subjects</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Failure to blind relevant individuals (including study participants, clinicians, data collectors, outcome adjudicators, and data analysts) to group assignment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loss to follow up (missing outcome data)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Failure of adhere to assigned intervention</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stopping early for benefit</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preferentially publishing small (underpowered) studies with statistically significant results (publication bias)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chance</strong> &ndash; Chance is random error, inherent in all observations. The probability of chance producing erroneous results can be minimized by studying a large number of patients. P-values are commonly misinterpreted as the probability that the findings are merely due to chance. Instead, p-values describe the probability that if the null hypothesis were true, the study would find a difference as large, or larger, than the one found. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proof-p-values-and-hypothesis-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proof, p-values, and hypothesis testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2674511252\"><span class=\"h2\">External validity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>External validity refers to the question of whether the results of the study apply to patients outside of the study, particularly the specific patient (or population) being considered by the EBM practitioner. Study patients are typically highly selected, unlike patients in usual practice. Often, they have been referred to academic medical centers, meet stringent inclusion criteria, are free of potentially confounding conditions or disorders, and are willing to countenance the rigorous demands of study protocols. As a result, they may be systematically different from the patients most doctors see in practice. In particular, study subjects in treatment trials are often at low risk for the adverse study outcome of interest (death, disease, dysfunction, dissatisfaction). Because treatment benefits are typically confined to patients at higher risk, it is not unusual, therefore, for study results to apply to only a minority of study subjects who have a sufficiently high baseline risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Although treatment effect size is often related to baseline risk, many studies do not measure this relationship, making it more difficult to judge whether, and how, study results apply to a particular individual patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2735340501\"><span class=\"h3\">Indirect evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a study involves a somewhat different population than is of interest to the EBM practitioner (eg, older, younger, sicker, healthier), some may be inclined reject the evidence altogether, claiming that it &quot;doesn't apply to my patient.&quot; In reality, this type of indirect evidence can help inform medical decision-making, particularly in the absence of direct evidence. Our confidence in the expected results, however, is generally lower than it would be with direct evidence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2351674257\"><span class=\"h3\">Subgroup analyses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the study does not address the specific patient population of interest, one strategy is to rely on subgroup analyses that evaluate results according to different patient characteristics (eg, age, sex, severity of illness). However, caution should be used in interpreting the results of subgroup analyses to avoid drawing false conclusions. Potential problems include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reporting bias</strong> &ndash; Subgroup analyses that are included in published reports may represent a select subset of all the analyses performed. The &quot;interesting&quot; subgroup analyses are preferentially presented, producing a positive reporting bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/9,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple comparisons</strong> &ndash; Whether examining a multiplicity of different outcomes or different patient subgroups, the probability of finding at least one spurious statistically significant finding increases as the number of analyses increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Perhaps the most celebrated illustration of this effect was a report of a randomized trial comparing streptokinase, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, both, or neither in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Authors, tongue-in-cheek, reported subgroup analysis by astrological birth sign. Subjects who were born under the signs of Gemini or Libra experienced slightly higher mortality from aspirin, whereas subjects born under the other astrological signs enjoyed a large reduction in mortality (p&lt;0.00001).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower statistical power</strong> &ndash; Subgroup analyses always involve fewer subjects than the main analysis, meaning that many are underpowered to detect a true effect (false-negative results). When underpowered subgroup analyses are coupled with selective reporting, it becomes more likely that positive subgroup results are false positives, and that the magnitude of effect is exaggerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/3,49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,49-52</a>].(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proof-p-values-and-hypothesis-testing#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proof, p-values, and hypothesis testing&quot;, section on 'Power in a negative study'</a>.)</p><p/><p>To minimize the risk of drawing false conclusions from subgroup analyses, EBM practitioners should ask the following questions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/11,12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were the subgroup analyses specified a priori, including hypotheses for the direction of the differences?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were subgroups defined by baseline risk (an approach that is frequently useful) or by post-randomization events, such as treatment adherence or changes in variables that might be effected by treatment (an approach that is usually misleading)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was the number of subgroup analyses limited to only a few?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were subgroup differences analyzed by testing for effect modification (interaction) rather than separate statistical tests for each subgroup?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If multiple analyses were performed, was an appropriate statistical technique used to account for multiple comparisons (Bayesian techniques or raising the threshold for statistical significance)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were subgroup analyses limited to primary outcomes? Exploring subgroup differences across all secondary outcomes exacerbates the multiplicity problem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was an effect seen only in the subgroup analyses when the main study results were negative? This is particularly likely to represent a false-positive finding and should be regarded with great skepticism.</p><p/><p>Subgroup differences reported in randomized controlled trials often have deficiencies in one or more of these categories, particularly failing to specify subgroup analyses a priori and failing to test for effect modification (interaction), and very few are corroborated in subsequent meta-analysis or randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Nevertheless, for treatment studies, high-value clinical research should almost always include a prespecified subgroup analysis of how absolute treatment benefit varies along a continuum of a risk score determined by multiple baseline variables considered together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This is because, for many treatments, the absolute treatment effect is much bigger in a high-risk minority and smaller in the lower-risk majority.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H370352045\"><span class=\"h1\">APPLYING THE EVIDENCE IN PRACTICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is often a gap between recommendations from the best available evidence and actual practice. The reasons for the gap are numerous, including uncertainty whether results of large studies apply to individual patients, lack of awareness or misunderstanding of the evidence, and failure to organize care in a way that fosters use of evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>EBM is not intended to replace clinical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Individual patients should be cared for in light of the best available research evidence, but with care tailored to their individual circumstances, including genetic makeup, past and concurrent illnesses, health-related behaviors, and personal preferences. Several studies clearly demonstrate that many clinical decisions are not made based on the best research evidence or on relevant individual patient characteristics, but seem most consistent with the practice habits or practice style of the clinicians.</p><p>A substantial body of research, as well as practical experience, has demonstrated that all of us, as we care for patients, engage in systematic errors of omission or commission, relative to the best available research evidence. Prominent examples are the widespread prescription of antibiotics for acute cough, or the use of radiologic tests for uncomplicated acute low back pain.</p><p>In some cases, failure to practice according to the best current evidence is due to a knowledge deficit. But knowledge alone rarely changes behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evidence-based-medicine/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Behavior change usually requires a combination of interventions and influences, including time for rethinking practice habits. The table lists the possible influences on clinicians' behavior, roughly in descending order of strength, based on a growing research literature on physician behavior change and on common sense (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58403\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58403 \">table 3</a>). Usually, no single influence is strong enough to make important changes; combinations are necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the care of patients using the best available research evidence to guide clinical decision making (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110429\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110429 \">figure 1</a>).The basic elements of evidence-based medicine include (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Formulating a clinical question</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Finding the best available evidence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assessing the validity of the evidence (including internal and external validity)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Applying the evidence in practice, in conjunction with clinical expertise and patient preferences</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The search for the best answer to a clinical question begins with a tight definition of the question. In formulating questions regarding the effectiveness on an intervention, four components (PICO: patient population, intervention, comparison, outcomes) should be considered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110430\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110430 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Formulating a clinical question'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence can be summarized at three levels of complexity: primary research, systematic reviews, and summaries and guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F110435\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110435 \">figure 3</a>). Appropriate research study design depends on the question being investigated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60667\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60667 \">figure 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H79723783\" class=\"local\">'Categories of evidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should have the skills necessary to critically evaluate research articles that are important to their practice. Critical appraisal skills enhance mastery and autonomy in the practice of medicine. The focus of critical appraisal is judging both internal validity and generalizability (external validity) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62952 \">figure 5</a>).
