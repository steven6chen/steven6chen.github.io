The use of other diagnostic tests in the evaluation of patients with seizures and epilepsy are presented separately.

The EEG recording depends upon differential amplification: the output is always expressed as the difference between two inputs, in a tracing that is called a channel.<strong> </strong>Typically, 21 or more channels are displayed in a montage,<em> </em>which forms the basis of EEG interpretation. With modern digital EEG technology, the electroencephalographer has virtually infinite ability to adjust the montages and other technical parameters in a given recording in order to optimize interpretation and analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1718165468\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of montages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main types of montages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Referential montage </strong>&ndash; In of the referential montage, each channel consists of the difference between a specific electrode and a reference. There are several types of references that can be used:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Common reference: Each electrode is compared with a common electrode, such as Cz, ipsilateral or contralateral ear, or a noncephalic reference (eg, the rarely used &quot;balanced neck-chest&quot; reference).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Common average reference: Each electrode is compared with a weighted average of the signal from all other head electrodes. Generally, electrode positions most susceptible to artifact (Fp1, Fp2, O1, O2) are excluded from the average.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laplacian and weighted average references: Each electrode is compared with a reference, which may consist of an average of the closest electrodes (Laplacian) or an average in which different electrodes are given different weights (weighted average). These montages are nonintuitive and require more extensive knowledge of EEG technology, and so they are not in common usage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bipolar montage </strong>&ndash; In the bipolar montage, each channel consists of a comparison of two adjacent electrodes. There are several types of bipolar montages, including: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anterior-posterior longitudinal bipolar: The electrode pairs are arranged in an anterior-posterior pattern in temporal and parasagittal chains, as well as a midline chain. This is the most versatile montage, and is the most commonly used montage for interpretation of routine EEG recordings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Transverse bipolar: Electrode pairs are arranged in a left-right pattern, starting in the front of the head and moving posteriorly. This is also called a &quot;coronal&quot; montage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Others, such as hatband, mandibular notch montage, and institution-specific bipolar montages: These montages are in much less frequent use, but may be chosen in order to display particular patterns.</p><p/><p>A discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of particular montages is beyond the scope of this topic. In general, it is important to recognize that no montage is perfect at detecting all types of abnormalities, and every montage is susceptible to artifact. For this reason, electroencephalographers must be cautious to change montages during interpretation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4084475658\"><span class=\"h2\">Amplitude and frequency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrical activity in each EEG channel can be described in terms of amplitude and frequency. The amplitude of typical EEG recordings ranges from 5 to 200 microvolts, but most awake background EEG recordings are in the range of 20 to 50 microvolts. Frequency of EEG activity is expressed according to the following terminology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delta &ndash; 0 to 4 Hz</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Theta &ndash; 4 to 8 Hz</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha &ndash; 8 to 13 Hz</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta &ndash; 13 to 30 Hz</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gamma &ndash; Greater than 30 Hz</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H508068626\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal EEG findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the normal awake adult with eyes closed, there is an 8.5 to 12 Hz alpha rhythm, maximal in the posterior part of the head. This is also referred to as the posterior-dominant rhythm. The amplitude of the alpha falls off anteriorly, where there is lower-voltage beta activity. The alpha rhythm becomes lower voltage (attenuates) or disappears altogether when the eyes open, and becomes higher voltage (augments) when the eyes close.</p><p>In some patients (eg, children, patients with mild cerebral dysfunction), the frequency of the &quot;alpha&quot; rhythm may be in the theta range, which introduces semantic confusion. Some electroencephalographers therefore prefer to use the term &quot;posterior-dominant rhythm&quot; instead. </p><p>With drowsiness (ie, stage N1 sleep), the alpha rhythm gradually disappears, fronto-central beta activity may become more prominent, and diffuse theta activity emerges. The stages and architecture of normal sleep are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stages-and-architecture-of-normal-sleep#H630021589\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stages and architecture of normal sleep&quot;, section on 'Sleep staging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EEG FINDINGS IN PATIENTS WITH EPILEPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different EEG findings are variably associated with epilepsy. In the setting of potential epilepsy, it is useful to classify EEG abnormalities as epileptiform and nonepileptiform.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examples of epileptiform activity include interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs; previously known as periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges [PLEDs]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62133\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef62133 \">waveform 1</a>), and generalized periodic discharges (GPDs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66411\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef66411 \">waveform 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonepileptiform abnormalities include slowing, which may be diffuse, regional, or localized; amplitude changes or asymmetries; and other deviations from normal patterns. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Slowing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Only epileptiform discharges are associated with epilepsy at rates sufficient to be clinically useful, and only when benign variants have been excluded. Nonspecific (nonepileptiform) EEG abnormalities are relatively common, especially in older individuals, patients with migraine, and those on centrally acting medications. These should not be interpreted as supporting a diagnosis of epilepsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Interictal epileptiform discharges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To qualify as an IED, discharges should meet the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They must be paroxysmal and distinct from the patient's normal background activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They must include an abrupt change in polarity occurring over several milliseconds (ms).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duration of each transient should be less than 200 ms. A spike has a duration of less than 70 ms; sharp waves have a duration between 70 and 200 ms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The discharge must have a physiologic field.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They must not be one of the known benign variants or normal discharges such as wicket spikes, small sharp spikes (SSS), or vertex waves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80464\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80464 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62862%7ENEURO%2F78379%7ENEURO%2F70492%7ENEURO%2F73673%7ENEURO%2F51113%7ENEURO%2F81768%7ENEURO%2F65255\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef62862 graphicRef78379 graphicRef70492 graphicRef73673 graphicRef51113 graphicRef81768 graphicRef65255 \">waveform 3A-G</a>).</p><p/><p>Most IEDs are of negative polarity at the scalp, and are followed by a slow wave (ie, a spike-wave complex). While these two features are not required criteria, they are helpful in distinguishing IEDs from other types of paroxysmal activity, including electrode or other artifacts. They also relate closely to the underlying physiologic phenomena occurring at the cellular level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An IED is found in 20 to 55 percent of persons with epilepsy on a first &quot;routine&quot; EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. A number of factors can influence the sensitivity of a finding of IED for the diagnosis of epilepsy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of EEG studies &ndash; With repeated recordings, the likelihood of finding IEDs increases from 20 to 50 percent to as high as 80 to 90 percent when four or more EEGs are obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5,6,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,8-11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EEG duration &ndash; A routine EEG is 30 to 45 minutes in length.

In this regard, a finding of IEDs may also be predictive of seizure recurrence. In a meta-analysis of 11 studies of EEG after a first unprovoked seizure in adults, the probability of seizure recurrence in patients with epileptiform EEG abnormalities was 50 percent compared with 27 percent in those with normal EEGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Patients with an estimated risk of recurrent seizure of &ge;60 percent after a single unprovoked seizure are considered to have epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing of EEG in relation to recent seizure &ndash; Clinical seizures are temporally associated with more frequent IEDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/5,6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,20</a>]. In a study of more than 600 outpatients with epilepsy or first seizure, the chance of finding epileptiform discharges on EEG decreased as time elapsed since the last seizure: 62 percent if &le;24 hours, 51 percent if 25 to 48 hours, 40 percent if 49 to 72 hours, and 31 percent if &gt;72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In another case series, early performance of an EEG (within 24 hours of a seizure) appeared to have a similar yield of epileptiform abnormalities as did a later-performed sleep-deprived study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Sleep and sleep deprivation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiseizure drug therapy &ndash; There is limited information regarding the suppressant effect of antiseizure drugs on IED detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>].

Another study found that antiseizure drug withdrawal was associated with fewer spikes on EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epilepsy syndrome &ndash; The EEG is more likely to be abnormal in certain epilepsy syndromes. As examples, IEDs are almost invariably present in children with untreated infantile spasms, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, and benign rolandic epilepsy. While medial temporal lobe epilepsy is usually associated with an abnormal interictal EEG, patients with frontal lobe epilepsy may have a normal interictal EEG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29</a>]. However, the presence of IEDs often influences both the diagnosis of epilepsy itself, as well as the specific epilepsy syndrome; as a result, this may be a source of substantial bias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specialized techniques &ndash; The use of activation procedures (hyperventilation, photic stimulation, sleep deprivation, induced sleep, and medication withdrawal) and special electrode placement can increase the yield of IEDs on an interictal EEG. Their use is recommended on most follow-up EEGs in order to improve the sensitivity of the test. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Specialized techniques'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; Factors that are variably reported to be associated with the prevalence of IEDs in persons with epilepsy include a younger age at the time of EEG, a longer duration of epilepsy, and an earlier age at epilepsy onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/6,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Specificity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IEDs are rare in patients without a history of seizures.

The prevalence of IEDs has been recorded to be somewhat higher in healthy children (3.5 to 6.5 percent) and in hospitalized adults with neurologic or psychiatric illness (2.0 to 2.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>].</p><p>A finding of IEDs is most helpful if the clinical history strongly suggests epileptic seizure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/2,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21</a>]. However, certain caveats apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pattern of IEDs, along with the patient's age, impacts the specificity of these findings. Spikes and sharp waves are common in normal neonates during quiet (non-REM) sleep, but disappear over the first six to eight weeks of life. By contrast, focal or multifocal IEDs in adults are almost always associated with epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/6,36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,36-39</a>]. In children, IEDs are less specific for epilepsy. In particular, central-midtemporal discharges, generalized spike-wave discharges, and photoparoxysmal responses may be asymptomatic manifestations of genetic traits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/electroencephalography-eeg-in-the-diagnosis-of-seizures-and-epilepsy/abstract/30,31,33,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31,33,40</a>].

EEG also assists in classifying the underlying epileptic syndrome and thereby guides management.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During a routine EEG, electrical activity is recorded from many different standard sites on the scalp according to the international (10 to 20) electrode placement system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78990\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78990 \">figure 1</a>). In the normal awake adult with eyes closed, there is a prominent alpha rhythm observed in the posterior part of the head. This rhythm gradually disappears with drowsiness. (See <a href=\"#H508068549\" class=\"local\">'Routine EEG technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single routine EEG has low sensitivity for detection of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) (20 to 50 percent) for patients with epilepsy. The sensitivity can be increased by repeating the study, recording for a longer period of time (such as overnight), including a recording of sleep (spontaneous, after sleep deprivation, or via administration of a sedative), performing the EEG within 24 hours of a seizure, and using special electrodes for temporal lobe epilepsy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Sensitivity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Specialized techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A normal EEG, however, can never rule out epilepsy; 10 to 20 percent of patients with definite epilepsy never have IEDs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, the specificity of IEDs for epilepsy is high, more than 90 percent in adults. However, inexperienced EEG interpreters can mistake artifact or benign EEG patterns for IEDs, lowering the specificity of the study. The specificity of this finding is also influenced by the pattern of IEDs, and by the patient's age, family history, and comorbid conditions. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Specificity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pitfalls in interpretation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs; previously known as periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges [PLEDs]) are usually seen in the setting of acute, relatively large cerebral injury, such as stroke, encephalitis, or rapidly growing cerebral malignancies. Patients with LPDs have an increased risk of acute symptomatic seizures as well as new-onset remote symptomatic epilepsy after recovery. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Lateralized periodic discharges'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized or focal slowing on EEG is nonspecific and does not suggest epilepsy. One exception is lateralized rhythmic delta (LRDA), which is associated with seizures, including the specific subtype of temporal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (TIRDA), which is highly associated with temporal lobe epilepsy.
