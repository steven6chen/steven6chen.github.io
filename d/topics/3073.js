Although the etiology is benign in most cases, this symptom may lead to school absences <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> restriction of activities and causes considerable anxiety in patients and their families. A thorough history and physical examination usually can determine the cause and identify patients who require acute intervention and those who can be managed with reassurance and continued follow-up. Laboratory testing is necessary only in a small number of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the absence of associated symptoms of illness, positive findings on physical examination related to the cardiac or respiratory systems, or symptoms during exertion, a serious organic cause is unlikely.</p><p>This topic will discuss the causes of nontraumatic chest pain in children and adolescents.

In the majority of pediatric patients, chest pain is <strong>not</strong> caused by a serious medical condition. However, potentially life-threatening cardiac conditions (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, or myocardial ischemia) and serious pulmonary conditions (eg, acute chest syndrome in patients with sickle cell disease, spontaneous pneumothorax, or pulmonary embolus) are found in 1 to 6 percent of pediatric patients with chest pain depending upon the setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-approach-and-initial-management#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontraumatic chest pain in children and adolescents: Approach and initial management&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.) </p><p>Chest pain causes considerable anxiety in patients and their families. Because of its association with fatal heart disease in adults, this symptom is viewed as a harbinger of serious cardiac disease in approximately half of patients seeking medical attention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>]. This interpretation is more common after the occurrence of sudden death involving an athlete in the community or at the professional level. As an example, in a series of 100 adolescent patients seen in a general pediatric clinic, nearly all of whom had no serious illness, 44 percent thought they were having a heart attack or were worried about heart disease (12 percent) or cancer (12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Pediatric chest pain also has important functional consequences because it may result in restriction of activities and school absences. In the review of 100 adolescents noted above, restriction of activities was reported in 69 percent of patients and 41 percent had absences from school because of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In another pediatric emergency-based survey of 336 children younger than 18 years of age with chest pain, 27 percent reported missing school because of the pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, it is important for clinicians to address patient and caregiver concerns during evaluation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876681620\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of chest pain in children vary among reports and depend in part upon whether patients were seen in an emergency department with acute symptoms or in a pediatric or cardiology setting with a more chronic complaint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-4,6,7,9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,6,7,9-15</a>].

Pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and, in children with sickle cell disease, acute chest syndrome, are potentially life-threatening conditions but occur rarely (&lt;1 percent of pediatric patients with chest pain). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876681632\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart disease is more likely if chest pain occurs during exertion or is associated with palpitations, syncope with exertion, or decreased exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with known congenital heart disease, heart transplant, substance abuse, or prior Kawasaki disease are at heightened risk for myocardial ischemia. A positive family history of cardiomyopathy, cardiac arrhythmia, or sudden death in close relatives before the age of 50 years should also raise suspicion. In addition to a suggestive history, most patients with heart disease will have an abnormal cardiac examination or electrocardiogram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F96306\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96306 \">table 2</a>). In patients with known heart disease, chest pain may indicate progression of the underlying condition.

Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the main pulmonary artery usually presents in infancy, but can become symptomatic later in childhood. In that disorder, left ventricular ischemia usually results in cardiomyopathy and mitral regurgitation. Origin of a coronary artery from the contralateral sinus of Valsalva and coursing of the anomalously positioned coronary artery between the aorta and pulmonary artery can be associated with exertional chest pain. In these patients, the pain is caused by compression of the coronary artery between the distended great arteries with the increased cardiac index associated with exercise with the following anatomic variants (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-pediatric-coronary-artery-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and pediatric coronary artery abnormalities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3460119\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular findings'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slit-like coronary orifice </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute angle of take-off of the coronary artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of an intramural segment </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876686825\"><span class=\"h3\">Classic angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although uncommon, children and adolescents with predisposing conditions, such as hyperlipidemia, prior Kawasaki disease with coronary artery aneurysms or stenoses, or collagen vascular disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) can develop classic angina consisting of crushing or squeezing substernal chest pain with radiation to the jaw or left arm and associated with diaphoresis, nausea and vomiting, difficulty breathing, or altered mental status. An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained while the patient has pain often shows ST wave elevation or depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65591\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65591 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54339\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54339 \">waveform 1</a>). Measurement of cardiac troponins can aid the diagnosis in patient for whom the chest symptoms or ECG are equivocal. However, reperfusion therapy should not await the results of troponin testing in patients with clear findings of an acute myocardial infarction on ECG.

Coronary vasospasm is associated with angina, transient ischemic changes on ECG during episodes of pain, cardiac enzyme elevation, and ST-segment elevation on ambulatory ECG monitoring. Variant angina with myocardial infarction has been described after recreational use of cocaine, amphetamines, bath salts (methcathinones), marijuana, and synthetic cannabinoids in adolescents.

The diagnosis of acute pericarditis is usually suspected based upon a history of characteristic pleuritic chest pain, and confirmed if a pericardial friction rub is present. Pericarditis should also be suspected in a patient with persistent fever and new, unexplained cardiomegaly. Additional testing, which typically includes blood work, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography, can support the diagnosis. The electrocardiogram is usually the most helpful test in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute pericarditis. Echocardiography can identify the presence and size of a pericardial effusion, potential presence of cardiac tamponade, and assess coexisting myocarditis by determining myocardial function.

A large pneumothorax may present with decreased chest excursion, diminished breath sounds, hyperresonant percussion, and decreased vocal fremitus on the affected side. Other signs of respiratory compromise may include tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and cyanosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous pneumothorax in children&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.) </p><p>Because the mediastinum is less mobile in older adolescents in whom spontaneous pneumothorax is most common, tension pneumothorax does not typically occur. When present, signs suggestive of tension pneumothorax include deviation of the trachea towards the contralateral side, tachycardia, hypotension, and cyanosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77092\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77092 \">figure 1</a>). Heart sounds may be diminished and the apical impulse shifted to the contralateral side. Tension pneumothorax is a respiratory emergency and requires urgent decompression.

Characteristic findings consist of air in the pleural space outlining the visceral pleura (pleural line) and hyperlucency and an attenuation of vascular and lung markings on the affected side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F90384\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90384 \">image 2</a>). Spontaneous pneumothorax occurs more commonly on the left side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F90378\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90378 \">image 3</a>). However, obtaining a chest radiograph should <strong>not </strong>delay needle or chest tube decompression in patients with life-threatening signs of tension pneumothorax.

Most commonly, however, the clinical manifestations of PE in children, especially younger ones, are not specific and often mimic the clinical symptoms of the underlying disease. For this reason and because infants and young children cannot verbalize their symptoms, PE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cardiorespiratory deterioration in all critically ill children.

Musculoskeletal pain can be traumatic or nontraumatic, although nontraumatic chest pain as an isolated complaint is more common. Occasionally, the clinician elicits a recent history of strenuous exercise of the chest muscles (eg, weight-lifting or push-ups) that has subsequently resulted in muscle soreness. Serious thoracic trauma is readily identified by history and physical examination in most patients and may result in chest wall or lung injury.

Only one area is usually involved, and young adults are more commonly affected. Tietze's syndrome is rare, and should be differentiated from more diffuse forms of myofascial chest pain (costochondritis) in which no areas of localized swelling are detected on examination. The cause of Tietze's syndrome is unknown, but antecedent upper respiratory infections and excessive coughing have been described in some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major causes of musculoskeletal chest pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Tietze's syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pleurodynia</strong> &ndash; Pleurodynia refers to an acute illness with marked paroxysmal spasms of the muscles of the chest and abdomen and fever. It most commonly occurs in association with group B coxsackie viruses. In children, characteristic vesicular stomatitis and rash on the palms and soles of the feet are often present as well (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53423\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53423 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52800 \">picture 3</a>). Most patients are ill for four to six days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-clinical-features-laboratory-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterovirus and parechovirus infections: Clinical features, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Pleurodynia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-and-herpangina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hand, foot, and mouth disease and herpangina&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic disorders</strong> &mdash; Chest pain rarely is caused by a neurologic disorder that affects one or more costal nerves. As an example, herpes zoster in a dermatomal distribution on the chest can cause pain, which may be manifest before lesions appear (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postherpetic-neuralgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postherpetic neuralgia&quot;</a>). Spinal cord compression, which may be caused by tumor or vertebral collapse, or epidural abscess is also a rare cause of radicular chest pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mitral valve prolapse</strong> &mdash; Although identified as a cause of chest pain in the past, whether patients with mitral valve prolapse have chest pain more frequently than normal children is unclear. In one study of 119 children, 18 percent had atypical chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, in a report of 813 children aged 9 to 14 years, 31 of whom had mitral valve prolapse, the incidence of chest pain was similar in affected and unaffected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Appropriately controlled studies in adult patients suggest that patients with mitral valve prolapse and control subjects are equally symptomatic. Thus, we do <strong>not</strong> typically attribute chest pain to mitral valve prolapse.
