In this topic review, we refer broadly to systemic sclerosis (SSc)-ILD and do not distinguish among the histopathologic subtypes. </p><p>In the vast majority of patients with SSc-ILD, the lung injury is characterized by a pattern termed nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Histopathologically, NSIP is characterized by varying degrees of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, with some forms being primarily inflammatory (cellular NSIP) and others primarily fibrotic (fibrotic NSIP). Although NSIP may have significant fibrosis, it is usually of uniform temporality. Fibroblast foci and honeycombing, which are hallmarks of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), if present, are rare. Patients with a more fibrosing form of NSIP have worse outcomes compared with those with cellular NSIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

This pattern is characterized by the presence of scattered foci of fibroblast proliferation (&quot;fibroblast foci&quot;) and a non-uniform distribution of areas of dense fibrosis, fibroblast foci, scant inflammation, normal lung, and honeycomb change. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias: Clinical manifestations and pathology&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATING THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment for systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) is not known. Based on the best available evidence, we suggest initiating immunosuppressive therapy in patients with symptomatic SSc-ILD and features suggesting a high likelihood of progression. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil is preferred over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> due to a better safety profile and comparable efficacy as described in the following sections. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a> is an alternative that can be considered for patients with contraindications to or intolerance of cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate. Patients can also be offered the opportunity to participate in a clinical trial (<a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=systemic+sclerosis&Search=Search&amp;token=7vutbvjTkgV8L5KmcEeYvR+dtDi/tYhpzkJDuwFHXnJHzyV5+VDaGTjXEORZx9fBz7BTZEAxwrBNxLTFRsg3y4TQ8J2kWUAMwiNW2rBGeK2nbcjh9CLYVyZC+Pce4RVC&amp;TOPIC_ID=4375\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">clinicaltrials.gov</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2004469349\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exact criteria for initiation of immunosuppressive treatment for SSc-ILD have not been established, and the decision about initiating therapy can be difficult because the benefits of therapy appear to be modest and the toxicities significant. As a portion of patients with SSc-ILD have stable or slowly progressive disease, the selection process requires a balance between avoiding potentially toxic agents in these patients, while providing therapy to those most likely to progress. Features that are associated with progressive disease are listed in the table and described below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105688 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>It is thought that patients are more likely to benefit from active therapy when it is initiated early in the course of disease, before a substantial loss of lung function has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. In approximately half of the patients with progressive ILD, the most rapid decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) occurs within the initial three years of disease onset, indicating that lung injury and fibrosis are early complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Features associated with ILD progression include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duration of ILD</strong> &ndash; Based on observational data, patients with early SSc-ILD are more likely to have active inflammation and to respond to pharmacologic intervention than those with long-standing disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although there is no uniform agreement on how early disease should be defined, it generally refers to the initial 12 to 24 months of SSc disease before significant irreversible organ fibrosis is established. However, results from the Scleroderma Lung Study (SLS1) showed that in some patients with SSc-ILD, lung disease can show progression even when present for more than four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary function</strong> &ndash; No specific pulmonary function test (PFT) values have been validated in SSc-ILD, as triggers for initiating therapy. Serial tests that demonstrate worsening pulmonary function (eg, a &ge;10 percent decline in FVC or diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]) are an indication of active disease and might be indications for considering intervention. Pulmonary function tests demonstrating a restrictive ventilatory defect (ie, reduced total lung capacity, often accompanied by a reduced FVC with a preserved forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] to FVC ratio) and decreased DLCO are consistent with SSc-ILD. A retrospective analysis of 80 patients with SSc-ILD from the Royal Brompton Hospital (London, United Kingdom) showed that mortality increased with decreasing initial FVC levels and decreasing initial DLCO levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Characteristic findings on PFTs are described separately.

In one study, radiologic changes affecting &gt;20 percent of the lung were shown to be predictors of greater mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A subsequent study of 172 patients confirmed these results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The finding of widespread honeycombing, on the other hand, suggests advanced fibrosis that is unlikely to respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Focal scarring may suggest recurrent aspiration that should be treated with measures to prevent aspiration rather than immunosuppressive therapy. The typical HRCT findings of SSc-ILD are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis of interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p>We do not use the results of bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts to determine the likelihood of response to immunosuppressive therapy, despite earlier small studies that suggested a correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Similarly, we do not obtain a lung biopsy to determine the histopathology, as the majority of patients with SSc-ILD have fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2656629032\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of an agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the decision has been made to initiate immunosuppressive therapy, we suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> based on evidence of comparable efficacy and a better adverse effect profile for MMF. This was illustrated in the Scleroderma Lung Study II (SLS II) that included 142 patients with SSc-ILD, characterized by a forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;80 percent, but &gt;45 percent, of predicted, exertional dyspnea grade 2 or higher on the Mahler Baseline Dyspnea Index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], ground glass opacities on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) with or without reticular opacities, and onset of the first non-Raynaud symptom of SSc within the prior 7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Participants were randomly assigned to MMF 1500 mg twice daily for 24 months or oral cyclophosphamide titrated up to a maximum daily dose of 1.8 to 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> for 12 months. Both groups demonstrated improvement in adjusted percent predicted FVC from baseline to 24 months: 2.19 percent (95% CI 0.53-3.84) in the MMF group and 2.88 percent (95% CI 1.19-4.58) in the cyclophosphamide group. No significant difference was noted between groups. Dyspnea improved in both groups based on the Transition Dyspnea Index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. MMF was better tolerated than cyclophosphamide based on a longer time to patient withdrawal and a lower incidence of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942183165\"><span class=\"h2\">Mycophenolate mofetil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MMF is an inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation that is often used in the treatment of extrapulmonary manifestations of SSc and other rheumatic diseases. Based on the SLS II trial described above that compared MMF with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, we suggest MMF as first line therapy in patients with SSc-ILD who are at risk for progressive ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Starting with lower doses may improve a patient's gastrointestinal tolerance of MMF. SLS II used a designated dose escalation schedule starting at 500 mg twice daily and increasing to the target dose over three to four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>The maximal dose of MMF should be reduced in patients with end-stage renal disease. A number of drug interactions can affect serum concentrations. In particular, proton pump inhibitors, antacids, and mineral supplements can decrease MMF absorption. Dosing of antacids and mineral supplements should be separated from MMF by least two hours. Dosing and potential drug interactions of MMF are described separately.

A complete blood count should be performed one to two weeks after the start of therapy. If there is no evidence of bone marrow suppression at that time, it is our practice to check complete blood counts every six to eight weeks. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal cramping, are frequent, but may improve with divided dosing (eg, three to four times a day) or a reduction in the total daily dose.

(See <a href=\"#H2004469349\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical benefits of immunosuppressive therapy for SSc-ILD appear to be modest and may be associated with substantial toxicity; therefore, the decision to initiate therapy must be made on a case-by-case basis after carefully balancing risk versus potential benefit and the importance of each to the patient. (See <a href=\"#H2004469349\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When deciding whether to initiate treatment for SSc-ILD, the extent and severity of ILD are assessed by a combination of clinical findings (eg, degree of dyspnea), high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and pulmonary function testing. These tests are used to estimate the extent of disease and likelihood of progression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105688\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105688 \">table 1</a>). Worsening pulmonary function demonstrated by serial testing (eg, a decrease in forced vital capacity or diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide &ge;10 percent) may be the most reliable indicator of progressive lung impairment. Bronchoalveolar lavage appears to have little utility in predicting disease progression or response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2004469349\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with SSc-ILD who have respiratory symptoms, abnormal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> declining pulmonary function, imaging evidence of ILD, and no evidence of active infection, we suggest initiating treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We prefer MMF over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> due to its better safety profile and the option for longer term therapy. Careful monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions is essential. (See <a href=\"#H2656629032\" class=\"local\">'Choice of an agent'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1942183165\" class=\"local\">'Mycophenolate mofetil'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an alternative to MMF, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> can be administered via monthly intravenous infusions for 6 months, or via daily oral dosing for 12 months. We prefer monthly intravenous treatments due to the lower cumulative dose, less frequent adverse effects (in our experience), and the ability to ensure adequate hydration prior to dosing. White blood cell count, renal function, and urinalysis should be monitored during cyclophosphamide therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2021550599\" class=\"local\">'Cyclophosphamide'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the use of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every effort should be made to avoid pregnancy during MMF or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> therapy. We advise giving prophylaxis to prevent <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (previously called <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em>) pneumonia for patients receiving cyclophosphamide. Such prophylaxis is less clearly needed and less routinely given, for patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> alone.

Typically, it is continued for at least 24 months and often for several years, depending on the patient&rsquo;s course. (See <a href=\"#H1153184496\" class=\"local\">'Dose and duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who receive an initial course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> are usually transitioned to another agent for maintenance therapy, due to the transient effect of cyclophosphamide. We generally select MMF over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> due to the impression of greater efficacy, but azathioprine is a reasonable alternative for those who do not tolerate MMF. (See <a href=\"#H23254633\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent maintenance therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in the patient's symptoms, subjective exercise tolerance, and pulmonary function are monitored at approximately three to six month intervals. Serial HRCTs are not obtained routinely, just when clinically indicated. For patients whose disease stabilizes or improves, maintenance therapy is continued until the improvement reaches a plateau at which time gradual withdrawal of therapy can be considered. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients whose disease is refractory to the above measures may be candidates for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> treatment or may prefer to explore experimental modalities for SSc-ILD (eg, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nintedanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nintedanib</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pirfenidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pirfenidone</a>); information about clinical trials is available at: <a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/home&amp;token=NK91I08KOJ1eJ1hT1o/oHgJu4vbbEBRl2V0d48fIIMDng+2205rRcoBrmv25kVW1&amp;TOPIC_ID=4375\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Clinicaltrials.gov</a>.
