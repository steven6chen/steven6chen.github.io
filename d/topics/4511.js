Despite the need for contraception, a national survey in the United States noted that sexually active obese women of reproductive age were significantly less likely to use contraception than women of normal weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It was unclear whether the disparity was due to patient, provider, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systems issues.</p><p>When counseling obese women about contraception, it is important to consider how obesity may affect the safety and efficacy of various contraceptive methods. Because contraceptive clinical trials excluded overweight or obese women until recently, evidence regarding contraceptive effectiveness and safety for this population is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. This topic will address the effects of obesity on contraceptive efficacy, as well as the effects of contraceptives on weight gain. Fertility and pregnancy issues in obese women are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in pregnancy: Complications and maternal management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193747533\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING A CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many factors need to be considered in choosing a contraceptive method (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;</a>). For obese women who want to maximize safety and efficacy, we suggest a copper- or levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (IUD). Intrauterine contraception has a very low rate of failure (compared with barrier methods), is not associated with weight gain (compared with depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> [DMPA]), and does not expose the woman to potential risks associated with estrogen-containing contraceptives. Visualizing the cervix and determining the size and direction of the uterus can be challenging in severely obese women during insertion of the device. Optimizing equipment by selecting a large speculum or removing the tip of a condom and placing it over the blades of the speculum can help with exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ultrasound may be helpful to guide insertion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Insertion and removal&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women who do not want to use intrauterine contraception, the potentially higher failure rates associated with oral contraceptives, the patch, and ring need to be balanced with the potentially high user failure rates associated with barrier methods. Contraception failure rates among obese oral contraceptive users are probably lower than in obese women using barrier methods, but women who choose to use oral contraceptive pills, the patch, or ring should consider using condoms as well to decrease pregnancy risk and the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, if applicable. In our opinion, the decision to use the pill, patch or ring should be based on the mode of hormonal delivery that the patient feels fits with her lifestyle. For all women who want to use a pill, we start with a pill containing 20 to 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. Although insufficient evidence exists to recommend a specific estrogen dose or use of a higher rather than a lower dose oral contraceptive pill, most pharmacokinetic studies in obese women used a pill containing 20 mcg ethinyl estradiol. We do not start any women on a pill with more than 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. If obese women are satisfied with a particular pill formulation, we do not switch them to a different pill unless they develop contraindications to estrogen use, in which case we discuss non-estrogen contraceptive options. Although it is tempting to simply double the dose of oral contraceptive used by obese women to achieve higher serum levels, alterations in the pharmacokinetics of steroid hormones based on weight and resulting end-organ suppression (prevention of ovulation) do not have linear relationships. Furthermore, doubling the dose could increase side effects and risks, so this is not recommended.</p><p>Because obese women, especially those with comorbidities, are at higher risk of pregnancy-related complications, avoidance of unintended pregnancy is especially important. In addition, obesity is a risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. Both types of IUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and hormonal contraceptives provide endometrial protection and have been associated with a decrease in this risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Hormonal contraceptives'</a>.)</p><p>The evidence for our approach is reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2269706994\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/pdf/summary-chart-us-medical-eligibility-criteria_508tagged.pdf&amp;token=jEVGVo6WqsDq698K1C6vDPPjIqTfzg54vW4qWS3doblDMO+X3NN/ro6R0xwK/I6IOwBh6DyNhV/q6vrv3T8nCaRCrZsEC+Wz9FPYFmXFzWEhd9uzeVTKQGeWKf6mT23Z1X5qsRVoFq27I5l+8ZoObQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5470\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use</a> are helpful for advising obese women about the safety of contraceptive methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>For obese women &ge;18 years of age without coexistent medical issues, the CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use categorizes progestin-only contraceptives and intrauterine devices (IUD) as class 1, which means that there are no restrictions in the use of these methods for obese women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Estrogen-containing contraception (pill, patch, ring) are categorized as class 2, which means that the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks. The class 2 rating is based on data that obesity is an independent risk factor for venous thrombosis (VTE) and case-control studies suggest that this risk is additive in users of estrogen-containing contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Of note, the Faculty of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care in the United Kingdom assigned estrogen-containing contraceptives for women with body mass index (BMI) 35 to 39 and &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> a class 3 and a class 4 rating, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Class 3 refers to a condition where the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method and class 4 refers to a condition which represents an unacceptable health risk if the contraceptive method is used. However, there is no consensus that this distinction is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and no safety data are available for women with BMI &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The presence of risk factors for VTE should be taken into account when counseling obese women about the risks of estrogen-progestin contraceptives. We offer estrogen-progestin contraceptives to obese women older than 35 years of age as long as they do not have other medical contraindications to use of these drugs. In epidemiologic studies, increasing age is consistently associated with an increased risk of VTE; however, the prevalence of comorbidities associated with increased VTE risk is also increased with increasing age. This makes the impact of age on VTE risk difficult to determine, particularly in reproductive aged women in whom the absolute incidence of VTE is low (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;</a>). The 2016 CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use category 2 rating (a condition for which the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks) for estrogen-containing contraceptives applies to women &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> regardless of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no evidence that any method of contraception is ineffective in obese women, but concerns have been raised that the efficacy of oral contraceptives is suboptimal in this population. It is important to remember that the overall rate of contraceptive failure is related to several factors, including the inherent effectiveness of the method, adherence and compliance with the method, fecundity of the population, and sexual behavior (eg, rare versus frequent sexual intercourse). It has been hypothesized that the inherent effectiveness of oral contraceptives may be diminished in obese women because obesity increases metabolic rate, increases clearance of hepatically metabolized drugs, increases circulating blood volume, and increases absorption of contraceptive steroids by adipose tissue. As a result, serum drug levels in obese women may be insufficient to maintain contraceptive effects, but data are limited and inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/2,12-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12-19</a>]. If contraceptive efficacy is reduced, the magnitude of effect is likely to be small as pharmacokinetic studies have estimated that body weight accounts for only 10 to 20 percent of the variability in hormone levels, which is consistent with normal variability in steroid levels among individuals.</p><p>Although obesity can affect fecundity, the vast majority of obese women ovulate regularly and are fertile. There is no evidence that obesity affects contraceptive <span class=\"nowrap\">adherence/compliance</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] or frequency of sexual intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2269710137\"><span class=\"h2\">Most effective reversible methods</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2269710205\"><span class=\"h3\">Intrauterine contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrauterine contraception (IUD) appears to be the best contraceptive option for obese women who have no contraindications to use of this method. The IUD is highly effective regardless of weight. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no evidence of impaired contraceptive efficacy in obese IUD users, either with the copper intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD) or the levonorgestrel-releasing IUD. A prospective cohort study reported no statistically significant difference in the contraceptive failure rate during the first two to three years of use among IUD users (copper-releasing or levonorgestrel-releasing [LNg20, 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> release, total <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> content 52 mg]) who were of normal body mass index (BMI) (n = 1584), overweight BMI (n = 1149), or obese BMI (n = 1467): the overall failure rate of less than 1 pregnancy per 100 woman years did not vary by BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The initial efficacy trial of a subsequent lower dose levonorgestrel-releasing IUD (LNg14; 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> release, total levonorgestrel content 13.5 mg) included women 38 to 155 kg (mean 68.7 kg) and BMI 16 to 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (mean 25.<span class=\"nowrap\">3kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and did not report lower efficacy for obese study participants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2269710211\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraceptive implant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> (LNg) and etonogestrel (ENg) contraceptive implants appear to be highly effective in overweight and obese women, although possibly less effective compared with women who weigh less. As an example, in a three-year trial of nearly 1000 women randomly assigned to receive the LNg implant, three pregnancies occurred, all in women weighing &ge;70 kg at conception, for a cumulative pregnancy rate of 0.4 per 100 women-years for all LNg users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. For nearly 1000 women randomly assigned to the ENg implant, there were no pregnancies in women &ge;70 kg compared with three pregnancies in women &lt;70 kg at conception. Because of the small total number of pregnancies study and relatively small number of women &ge;70 kg (fewer than 20 percent of subjects), it is unclear whether weight &ge;70 kg affects contraceptive implant efficacy and whether there is a true difference in efficacy between LNg and ENg implants at weights &ge;70 kg. Despite the small numbers, however, it is likely that there is no large difference in contraceptive implant efficacy between women &ge;70 kg and those &lt;70 kg.</p><p>Despite the limitations, the trial is consistent with pharmacologic studies in obese women reporting that plasma hormone concentrations for both ENg and LNg remain above the contraceptive threshold for the approved duration of the device, although these levels may be lower than for non-obese women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. </p><p>Of note, only the ENg implant is available in the United States.

In addition, a study of the pharmacokinetics of DMPA-SC in class I, II, and III obese women versus women with normal BMI observed that median medroxyprogesterone levels remained above the level needed to prevent ovulation, although estradiol levels fluctuated more in obese women than normal controls (normal BMI: 18.5 and 24.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</span> class I obesity: BMI 30.0 to 34.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</span> class II obesity: BMI 35.0 to 39.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>;</span> class III obesity: BMI &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Of note, the persistence of ovulation suppression following discontinuation of DMPA is related to weight: women with lower body weights conceive sooner than women with higher body weights after discontinuing the drug.

In a study including a cohort of more than 55,000 United States women, oral contraceptive pill failure was slightly higher for women with BMI &ge;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> compared with women with BMI &lt;35 (adjusted HR 1.5 (95% CI 1.3-1.8)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

A pooled analysis of three large studies examining the efficacy of the contraceptive patch reported contraceptive failure was low and uniformly distributed across the range of body weights &lt;90 kg (198 pounds), but suggested the patch may be less effective in the subgroup of women &ge;90 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In this analysis, 5 of the 15 pregnancies in patch users occurred in the 83 women (3 percent of study subjects) who weighted &ge;90 kg. The small number of pregnancies in this pooled analysis made it impossible to provide a good estimate of the excess risk of contraceptive failure in women weighing &ge;90 kg.</p><p>Efficacy studies of the contraceptive patch have included a higher proportion of overweight and obese women and a wider range of body weights than studies of other contraceptive methods. Most oral contraceptive studies excluded women more than 20 percent above their ideal body weight, whereas studies of the contraceptive patch included women as much as 35 percent above their ideal body weight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28036443\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraceptive ring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All large trials assessing the effectiveness of the estrogen-progestin vaginal ring have been conducted in nonobese women. A study of 128 pregnancies that resulted from a combined group of pill, patch, or ring users concluded three-year failure rates among women using these methods were not different across BMI categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, the methodology used and the possible effect of noncompliance may have masked the actual effect of BMI on contraceptive failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>A small pharmacokinetic study in ring users found that follicular development was minimal in both obese and normal BMI women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Theoretically, obesity should not affect the safety or efficacy of barrier contraceptives, but diaphragms should be resized if the patient has a large change in weight. Condoms (male and female), the diaphragm, cervical cap, and contraceptive sponge are the most common forms of barrier contraception. These are event-based methods of contraception, which makes them more prone to user-related contraceptive failure. If a double barrier method is used (eg, condom and vaginal spermicide, diaphragm and condom), efficacy increases substantially.

Women who undergo restrictive bariatric procedures can safely and effectively begin oral contraceptives. However, procedures causing malabsorption, such as biliopancreatic diversion or jejunoileal bypass or Roux-en-Y bypass, theoretically may interfere with the absorption of oral contraceptives, thus reducing their effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. For this reason, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) suggests that women undergoing bariatric surgery with a significant malabsorption component who want to use hormonal contraception should preferentially consider non-oral delivery of the contraceptive hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Non-oral hormonal contraceptives have been studied in only small numbers of obese patients, but appear to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. Nonhormonal methods are an acceptable alternative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility and pregnancy after bariatric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155018281\"><span class=\"h1\">EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=copper-intrauterine-device-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">copper intrauterine device</a> (IUD) is the most reliable method of emergency contraception in obese women. Oral drugs may be less effective or ineffective as emergency contraception in overweight and obese women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception#H368109296\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency contraception&quot;, section on 'Overweight and obese women'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1911344144\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These methods have a very low rate of failure (compared with barrier methods), are not associated with weight gain (compared with depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> [DMPA]), and do not expose the woman to potential risks associated with estrogen-containing contraceptives. (See <a href=\"#H193747533\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a contraceptive method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We agree with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines that the advantages of using an estrogen-containing contraceptive method (pill, patch, ring) generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks in obese women (see <a href=\"#H2269706994\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> above). Although insufficient evidence exists to recommend a specific estrogen dose, we generally start with a pill containing 20 to 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. (See <a href=\"#H193747533\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a contraceptive method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We offer estrogen-progestin contraceptives to obese women older than 35 years of age as long as they do not have other medical contraindications to use of these drugs. (See <a href=\"#H2269706994\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not recommend one method of estrogen-progestin contraception over another. The decision to use the pill, patch, or ring should be based on the mode of hormonal delivery that the patient feels fits with her lifestyle. For all women who choose to oral contraception, we start with a pill containing 20 to 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol. (See <a href=\"#H193747533\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a contraceptive method'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no strong evidence that any method of contraception is ineffective in obese women, but concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of oral contraceptives, as well as the patch and ring. The available literature suggests that oral contraceptives are generally effective at pregnancy prevention in obese women, but may be less forgiving of imperfect use because the pharmacokinetics of steroid hormones appear to be altered in obese oral contraceptive pill users compared with normal-weight users. However, ovulation is still suppressed in most obese oral contraceptive pill users. If contraceptive efficacy is reduced, the magnitude of effect is likely to be small. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is good evidence that use of combined hormonal contraceptives, progestin-only pills, intrauterine contraception, and contraceptive implants is not associated with substantial weight gain or discontinuation of contraception due to weight gain. Use of DMPA may be associated with weight gain. (See <a href=\"#H2269710839\" class=\"local\">'Weight gain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For obese women who desire a permanent method of contraception, we suggest hysteroscopic transcervical tubal occlusion over tubal ligation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Abdominal surgical procedures in obese women are associated with greater anesthesia risk and longer operating times. (See <a href=\"#H2269711226\" class=\"local\">'Surgical sterilization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bariatric surgery procedures causing malabsorption, such as biliopancreatic diversion or jejunoileal bypass, may interfere with the absorption of oral contraceptives, thus reducing their effectiveness. If hormonal contraception is used, we suggest non-oral hormonal contraceptives over oral hormonal contraceptives (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2269711396\" class=\"local\">'Contraception pre- and post-bariatric surgery'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contraception-counseling-for-obese-women/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Chuang CH, Chase GA, Bensyl DM, Weisman CS.
