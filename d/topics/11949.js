In most cases, it is not associated with a significant increase in the rate of any clinically important adverse <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> outcome. In case reports and small case series, tight nuchal cords have been associated with adverse outcomes, including fetal asphyxia and demise, but causality has not been proven. This topic will discuss issues related to prenatal diagnosis of nuchal cords, pregnancy and intrapartum management, and potential outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6183410\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term nuchal cord describes an umbilical cord that passes 360 degrees around the fetal neck. Nuchal cords can be classified as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single or multiple</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loose or tight (ie, compressing the fetal neck)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type A or B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108849\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108849 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type A &ndash; The placental end crosses over the umbilical end, entangling the neck in an unlocked pattern</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type B &ndash; The placental end crosses under the umbilical end, entangling the neck in a locked pattern </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2114083939\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The occurrence of a nuchal cord(s) appears to be a random event, with increased risk among fetuses with excessive movement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a long umbilical cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In a retrospective study of singleton vaginal deliveries at term, an excessively long cord (&ge;70 cm in length) was far more common in pregnancies with a nuchal cord than in those with no nuchal cord <span class=\"nowrap\">(403/1451</span> [28 percent] versus <span class=\"nowrap\">54/4733</span> [1 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91524134\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of nuchal cords increases with increasing gestational age. At term, reported incidence ranges from 15 to 34 percent in large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p>Single nuchal cords are more common than multiple nuchal cords (11 to 28 percent versus 2 to 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/6,7,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,10-12</a>]. In one study, the incidence of single, double, triple, and quadruple nuchal cords at delivery was reported to be 10.6, 2.5, 0.5 and 0.1 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6183676\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prenatal diagnosis of a nuchal cord is based on an ultrasound examination documenting that at least 75 percent of the neck is encircled by umbilical cord. This is because, near term and depending on the lie of the fetus, imaging 100 percent of the neck is not always possible.</p><p>Ultrasound cannot consistently and reliably distinguish between tight and loose nuchal cords [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]; however, indentation of the fetal neck (&quot;divot sign&quot;) suggests that the cord is tight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Tightness may change during labor as the fetus descends through the birth canal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3976083795\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic performance of ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both longitudinal and transverse views of the fetal neck should be obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54917\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54917 \">image 1</a>). Color Doppler imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67672\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67672 \">image 2</a>) or Doppler flow velocimetry enhances sensitivity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108023\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef108023 \">movie 1</a>). The sensitivity of ultrasound for diagnosis of a nuchal cord at term has generally been reported to be approximately 70 percent for gray-scale imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>], increasing to 83 to 97 percent with color Doppler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/13,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17-19</a>].</p><p>In a study that compared the diagnostic performance of two-dimensional, color Doppler, and three-dimensional ultrasound for predicting a nuchal cord at birth in 120 singleton pregnancies, the overall performance of these techniques was: gray-scale (sensitivity 68.6 percent, specificity 80 percent, accuracy 76.7 percent), color Doppler (sensitivity 82.9 percent, specificity 77.7 percent, accuracy 79.2 percent) and three-dimensional ultrasound (sensitivity 71.4 percent, specificity 82.4 percent, accuracy 79.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These differences were not significant, possibly due to the small number of pregnancies with a nuchal cord (n = 35) and the high proportion with multiple nuchal cords <span class=\"nowrap\">(5/35)</span>. Nuchal cords are easier to detect when there are multiple loops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. The authors' subjective assessment of the ease of visualization of nuchal cord was best with three-dimensional sonography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H405886460\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sonographic findings that may be misdiagnosed as a nuchal cord include a cord adjacent to but not encircling the fetal neck, posterior cystic neck mass, fetal skin folds, and amniotic fluid pockets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Obtaining multiple real-time images from different angles and Doppler imaging can readily distinguish a nuchal cord encircling the fetal neck from these other entities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4256066721\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not screen for the presence of a nuchal cord, given the lack of high-or even moderate-quality evidence that prenatal diagnosis of nuchal cords improves pregnancy outcome (see <a href=\"#H6183967\" class=\"local\">'Possible sequelae during pregnancy'</a> below). The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine does not consider attempts to visualize a nuchal cord a part of the standard prenatal ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and prenatally diagnosed nuchal cords are not routinely reported in ultrasound reports since they can be considered a normal finding.</p><p>In addition, screening is harmful if it causes maternal anxiety and leads to unnecessary sonographic follow-up appointments, antepartum fetal assessment, and intervention.</p><p>For patients who ask about a nuchal cord during their ultrasound examination, we reassure them that visualization of nuchal cord is a common incidental finding, often resolves, has not been associated with a markedly increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, and does not warrant specific changes in prenatal or intrapartum care based on this finding alone. (See <a href=\"#H6184752\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H229660345\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A nuchal cord may persist or resolve, and those that resolve may reform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>]. Although formation and resolution appear to be random events, persistence may be more likely at term and with multiple nuchal cords. The type of nuchal cord impacts the course: A type A nuchal cord can become undone with fetal movement, whereas a type B nuchal cord cannot undo itself and can form a true knot when it passes caudally over the fetal body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108849\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108849 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6183967\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE SEQUELAE DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The body of evidence from observational studies suggests that nuchal cords are not associated with a significant increase in the rate of any clinically important adverse <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> event. This evidence is of low quality due to factors such as publication bias, lack of comparison with an adequate control group, limitations of data derived from chart review and discharge coding, and small numbers of subjects and events.</p><p>In the largest available data set, in which a tight nuchal cord (defined as inability to manually reduce the loop over the head) was documented in 6.6 percent of 219,337 live births, there was no association with adverse neonatal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, a small increase in one or more adverse outcomes could not be excluded conclusively. In case reports and some small case series, nuchal cords have been associated with fetal demise, impaired fetal growth, meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and an increased frequency of intrapartum fetal heart rate abnormalities, operative delivery, low five-minute Apgar scores, and umbilical artery acidemia. Long-term, an increased risk of neurodevelopmental abnormalities has been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12602569\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal demise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from large retrospective studies have not demonstrated an increased risk of stillbirth in fetuses with nuchal cords compared with those without nuchal cords [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/8,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23-25</a>]. However, case reports of stillbirths with one or more nuchal cords, indentation marks in the tissue around the fetal neck, otherwise normal prenatal and postnatal evaluations, and no other explanation for the demise suggest that nuchal cords can rarely be a cause of fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The presence of a nuchal cord alone is insufficient evidence of demise due to strangulation, but causality is supported by the presence of the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Petechial hemorrhages of the head and neck, which are characteristic findings in strangulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular congestion and thrombosis of umbilical cord vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cord edema or hemorrhage into the Wharton's jelly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular ectasia, vascular thrombosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombotic vasculopathy (avascular villi, villous stromal karyorrhexis) involving the umbilical cord vessels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chorionic plate and stem villous vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of other conditions associated with fetal demise.</p><p/><p>One potential mechanism for fetal asphyxia is restriction of carotid artery blood flow from tight entanglement around the neck; however, severe venous congestion may be sufficient to cause asphyxia and demise. Another potential mechanism is compression of the umbilical cord vessels themselves when the cord becomes tightly compressed against itself or the fetal neck. Both mechanisms may be involved.</p><p>A tight nuchal cord may not be present at delivery because loss of fetal tone with increasing cerebral hypoxia may lead to loosening of the nuchal cord if multiple loops are not present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12602460\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired intrauterine growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether nuchal cords adversely affect fetal growth is unclear. Studies that have not discriminated between single and multiple nuchal cords have not reported a clinically significant impact of nuchal cords on birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/5,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,30</a>].</p><p>Several studies have observed a significant negative correlation between the number of nuchal cord entanglements and birth weight; multiple nuchal cords reduced birth weight by 93 to 180 grams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/6,10,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,31</a>]. However, others have reported discordant findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12602468\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormalities in tests for fetal evaluation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1363860404\"><span class=\"h3\">First-trimester combined test for Down syndrome screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A nuchal cord may be detected incidentally during measurement of nuchal translucency and may alter the nuchal translucency (NT) measurement if it is tight, or it may not be detected and incorrectly included in the measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The presence or absence of a nuchal cord can be easily determined by color Doppler, even in the first trimester (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108023\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef108023 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108024\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef108024 \">movie 2</a>). In one prospective study including 53 fetuses with a nuchal cord during NT measurement (incidence 4.65 percent), the largest NT measurement overestimated NT in 50 percent, underestimated NT in 48 percent, and estimated NT correctly in 2 percent of cases compared with the true NT measurement after resolution of the nuchal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>If a nuchal cord is indenting the fetal neck, we suggest obtaining a NT measurement after resolution, which typically occurs within a short period of time. The median time to resolution was 2.21 hours in the study described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. If the cord is loose, NT can be measured accurately as long as correct anatomic landmarks are used. If the nuchal cord does not resolve, measurements of NT above and below the cord will be different; the average of the two measurements is used to calculate risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H143095131\"><span class=\"h3\">Antepartum fetal monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Information on the effect of nuchal cords on the nonstress test is sparse. Theoretically, vigorous fetal movement can tighten the nuchal cord, resulting in compression of carotid and umbilical blood vessels. The potential fetal heart rate consequences are variable decelerations and possibly late decelerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/2,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,37-39</a>]. However, at least one small retrospective study of variable decelerations during reactive nonstress tests found no correlation with the frequency of nuchal cords or other cord entanglements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrapartum fetal heart rate assessment&quot;, section on 'Physiologic significance of selected FHR characteristics'</a>). Prospective studies have reported similar Doppler indices in the cerebral arteries of fetuses with and without nuchal cords [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/18,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,41,42</a>]. Other prospective studies of term and postterm pregnancies have not reported a reduction in prelabor amniotic fluid levels in pregnancies with nuchal cords [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/14,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,43,44</a>].</p><p>These findings in large series do not exclude the possibility that an individual fetus with a tight nuchal cord may become compromised. As an example, a case report described absent fetal movement on a routine ultrasound examination of a 30-week appropriate for gestational age fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Doppler velocimetry revealed absent end-diastolic Doppler flow and cardiotocography showed repetitive severe variable decelerations. Emergency cesarean delivery was performed with delivery of a 1200 gram, acidemic (pH 7.10) newborn with a tight double nuchal cord. Laboratory evaluation and placental histopathology were otherwise normal so the metabolic acidosis was attributed to the nuchal cords.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6184444\"><span class=\"h3\">Intrapartum fetal monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prospective studies of newborn outcomes after antenatal identification of nuchal cords have generally not described increased rates of nonreassuring fetal heart rate patterns or operative delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/14,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,43-45</a>]. However, each of these studies included fewer than 400 subjects. In contrast, two large retrospective studies including approximately 38,000 fetuses with a nuchal cord at birth reported these pregnancies had a 60 to 80 percent increase in the frequency of abnormal fetal heart rate tracings compared with pregnancies with no nuchal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/5,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,30</a>], although the cesarean delivery rate was not increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Both studies observed a higher rate of labor induction in pregnancies with a nuchal cord, which may account, at least in part, for the increased frequency of fetal heart rate abnormalities. Multiple nuchal cords appear to increase the risk of an abnormal fetal heart rate tracing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/7,25,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25,46</a>].</p><p>A study that used near-infrared spectroscopy to assess the intrapartum effect of nuchal cords on cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation found that nuchal cords were associated with an increase in cerebral blood volume during contractions, without a significant effect on cerebral oxygenation or neonatal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. An increase in variable decelerations was also noted. The authors hypothesized that these findings were due to transient compression of the jugular veins by the cord during contractions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6184752\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2833706761\"><span class=\"h2\">Antepartum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An incidental finding of a nuchal cord on ultrasound examination does not warrant a change in prenatal care, given the lack of evidence of a clinically significant increase in adverse pregnancy outcome. (See <a href=\"#H6183967\" class=\"local\">'Possible sequelae during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p>No randomized trials or prospective studies have compared potential approaches to management of pregnancies with nuchal cords diagnosed prenatally. A retrospective study compared the outcomes of 188 pregnancies with nuchal cords detected by sonography during the second and third trimesters with 115 pregnancies without prenatally detected nuchal cords [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. At delivery, 37 percent of pregnancies with prenatally diagnosed nuchal cords had nuchal cords versus 15 percent of the control group. Both groups had similar perinatal outcomes and few adverse events. This study of nuchal cords diagnosed remote from delivery, although small and retrospective, confirms previous data of generally good outcomes of nuchal cords diagnosed closer to the time of delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3354820296\"><span class=\"h2\">During labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a nuchal cord does not affect our intrapartum management. As discussed above, there is no strong evidence of a clinically significant increase in adverse pregnancy outcome (see <a href=\"#H6183967\" class=\"local\">'Possible sequelae during pregnancy'</a> above). As the fetal head descends or rotates, changes in the tightness of a nuchal cord may occur and may result in fetal heart rate decelerations, which should be managed as in any labor with fetal heart rate decelerations. In an observational study of pregnant women with fetuses with nuchal cords, Doppler ultrasound had poor sensitivity and specificity for predicting intrapartum fetal distress necessitating cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-intrapartum-category-i-ii-and-iii-fetal-heart-rate-tracings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of intrapartum category I, II, and III fetal heart rate tracings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1536697447\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a loose nuchal cord(s) is palpated after expulsion of the fetal head, it can usually be slipped over the head to free the fetus from the tether. If the cord(s) is too tight to easily slip over the head, it may be possible to slip it back over the shoulders and deliver the body through the loop.</p><p>These approaches may be unsuccessful if the cord is too tight. In these cases, it is important to avoid avulsing or tearing the cord while attempting to effect delivery. Occasionally, the body can be delivered without releasing the cord and without compromising the fetus. In most cases, we place a palm on the fetal occiput and push the face into the mother's thigh (or pubic bone), which allows the shoulders, then body, then legs to deliver (called &quot;somersault maneuver&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107944\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107944 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. The cord can then be unwrapped from the neck. In rare cases when this maneuver is not successful, the cord is doubly clamped and transected. However, early clamping and cord cutting decreases the volume of blood transferred from the placenta to the neonate, which may increase neonatal anemia, and may adversely affect the fetal to neonatal transition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of normal labor and delivery&quot;, section on 'Cord clamping'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1239056961\"><span class=\"h1\">NEONATAL OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248160759\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal intensive care unit admission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-term outcomes of neonates with a history of a tight nuchal cord are favorable. In a large retrospective study, term neonates with a tight nuchal cord were slightly more likely to be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit but not more likely to have <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dopamine</a> administered, have blood hemoglobin measured on the first day, receive a transfusion, or die [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Although the development scores of both groups were in the normal range and averaged well above the standard means, the nuchal cord group had slightly, but statistically, lower scores, which was attributed to the cases with multiple or tight nuchal cords with intrapartum signs of fetal compromise.</p><p>It is not clear whether a nuchal cord increases the risk for developing cerebral palsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-56</a>]. The collaborative study of cerebral palsy, a prospective multicenter study including over 12,000 infants, found no increased risk of clinical neurologic impairment at one year of age among the over 4200 infants with nuchal cords at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In contrast, a population-based case-control study of 271 singletons with spastic cerebral palsy and 217 controls without developmental disorders reported a 2.8-fold increased risk of spastic cerebral palsy in newborns with a nuchal cord (odds ratio [OR] 2.8, 95% CI 1.31-6.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>Some authors have suggested that tightness of the nuchal cord is the key factor increasing the risk of adverse outcome. A retrospective study reported that a tight nuchal cord at delivery increased the odds of developing unexplained spastic quadriplegia (OR 18, 95% CI 6.2-48) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Other presentations of nuchal cords, such as any or multiple entanglements, were not analyzed. However, tightness of the nuchal cord was not significantly associated with cerebral palsy in another retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. A retrospective study analyzing factors preceding neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) found that a tight nuchal cord was an independent risk factor for HIE (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.02-7.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>The possible association of a tight nuchal cord with cerebral palsy in retrospective studies may be due to recording bias: Documentation of a tight nuchal cord may be more likely when the infant is born in a poor condition. In a study comparing elective versus systematic recording of umbilical cords in healthy infants with low Apgar scores &lt;7 at one minute, documentation of a tight nuchal cord was six times more likely than when recording was systematic. Likewise, when the presence or absence of nuchal cords was recorded systematically, a significant association between nuchal cords or tight nuchal cords and cerebral palsy was not observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6184831\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nuchal cords can occur as single or multiple entanglements around the fetal neck. They may be loose or tight. They have been classified as type A or B (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108849\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108849 \">figure 1</a>) (See <a href=\"#H6183410\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The occurrence of a nuchal cord(s) appears to be a random event, with increased risk among fetuses with excessive movement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a long umbilical cord. (See <a href=\"#H2114083939\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nuchal cord can form at any gestational age but appears to be more common at term. It may persist, disentangle, or reform. Type B nuchal cords are more likely to persist than type A nuchal cords (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108849\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108849 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H91524134\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H229660345\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of nuchal cords at term ranges from 15 to 34 percent of births. Ninety percent are single. (See <a href=\"#H91524134\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H229660345\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prenatal diagnosis of an incidental nuchal cord is based on an ultrasound examination documenting that at least 75 percent of the neck is encircled by umbilical cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108023\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef108023 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F108024\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef108024 \">movie 2</a>). Color Doppler imaging or Doppler flow velocimetry (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67672\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67672 \">image 2</a>) helps to confirm a diagnosis made by gray-scale imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54917\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54917 \">image 1</a>). The sensitivity of ultrasound for detecting nuchal cords at term has been reported to be approximately 70 percent for gray-scale imaging and 83 to 97 percent with color Doppler. (See <a href=\"#H3976083795\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic performance of ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although available data are of low quality, the body of evidence suggests that nuchal cords are not associated with a significant increase in the rate of any clinically important adverse <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, in case reports and small case series nuchal cords have been associated with serious adverse outcomes, such as fetal demise and impaired fetal growth, as well as an increased rate of intrapartum fetal heart rate abnormalities leading to an increased rate of operative delivery. (See <a href=\"#H6183967\" class=\"local\">'Possible sequelae during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We<strong> </strong>suggest not<strong> </strong>screening for nuchal cords during pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). There is no high or even moderate quality evidence that nuchal cords adversely affect pregnancy outcome or that prenatal diagnosis of nuchal cords improves pregnancy outcome. (See <a href=\"#H4256066721\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6183967\" class=\"local\">'Possible sequelae during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An incidental finding of a nuchal cord on ultrasound examination does not warrant a change in prenatal or intrapartum care, given the lack of evidence of a clinically significant increase in adverse pregnancy outcome. (See <a href=\"#H2833706761\" class=\"local\">'Antepartum'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3354820296\" class=\"local\">'During labor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not report incidental detection of a nuchal cord, as it can be considered a normal finding. For patients who ask about a nuchal cord, we reassure the patient that a nuchal cord is a common finding that often resolves and that persistent nuchal cords have not been associated with a markedly increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. As in all pregnancies, the patient should be instructed to report decreased fetal movement to her provider. (See <a href=\"#H4256066721\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the cord is around the neck after expulsion of the fetal head, slipping the cord over the head or slipping it over the shoulders and delivering the body through the loop usually successfully frees the fetus from the tether. If delivery of the shoulders and body are compromised by a tight single or multiple nuchal cord that is not reducible, we perform a &quot;somersault maneuver.&quot; If this is not successful, the cord may be clamped and cut. (See <a href=\"#H1536697447\" class=\"local\">'Delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal demise due to strangulation is rare. The presence of a nuchal cord alone is insufficient evidence of causality. The presence of the following findings supports causality in these rare cases (see <a href=\"#H12602569\" class=\"local\">'Fetal demise'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One or more nuchal cords indenting fetal neck tissue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Petechial hemorrhages of the head and neck</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vascular congestion and thrombosis of umbilical cord vessels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cord edema or hemorrhage into the Wharton's jelly </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vascular ectasia, vascular thrombosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombotic vasculopathy (avascular villi, villous stromal karyorrhexis) involving the umbilical cord vessels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chorionic plate and stem villous vessels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absence of other conditions associated with fetal demise</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nuchal-cord/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Collins JH.
