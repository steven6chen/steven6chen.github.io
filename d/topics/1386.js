Markers placed in the stomach can often be detected in the lungs of healthy persons using scintigraphic methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sensitive tests show that at least one-half of healthy adults aspirate during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pulmonary sequelae depend upon the volume and contents of the inoculum and host defense mechanisms. Aspiration pneumonia refers to the pulmonary consequences resulting from this abnormal entry of fluid, particulate exogenous substances, or endogenous secretions into the lower airways. There are usually two requirements to produce aspiration pneumonia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compromise in the usual defenses that protect the lower airways including glottic closure, cough reflex, and other clearing mechanisms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An inoculum deleterious to the lower airways by a direct toxic effect (such as gastric acid), stimulation of an inflammatory process from bacterial infection, or obstruction due to uncleared fluid or particulate matter</p><p/><p>Most pneumonia arises following the aspiration of microorganisms from the oral cavity or nasopharynx. The term aspiration pneumonia should be reserved for pneumonitis resulting from the altered clearance defenses noted above. The pathogens that commonly produce pneumonia, such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, gram-negative bacilli, and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, are relatively virulent bacteria so that only a small inoculum is required, and the aspiration is usually subtle. A true aspiration pneumonia, by convention, usually refers to an infection caused by less virulent bacteria, primarily anaerobes, which are common constituents of the normal flora in a susceptible host prone to aspiration. In a review of 1348 patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, 13.8 percent were considered to be at risk for aspiration; risk factors included neurologic disorders, reduced consciousness, esophageal disorders, vomiting, or witnessed aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The standard teaching has been that the lower respiratory tract is normally sterile below the larynx so that specimens collected in such a way as to avoid contaminants from above that level (transtracheal aspiration, transthoracic aspiration, bronchoscopy with a protected brush) define pathology. However, more recent studies using culture-independent techniques have shown that there is a respiratory tract microbiome that extends from the nasal passages to the alveoli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. These data suggest that microaspiration is common and that aspiration pneumonia is a consequence of a large inoculum, the pathogenicity of the microbes aspirated, or both.</p><p>The predisposing conditions, clinical syndromes, diagnosis, and treatment of aspiration pneumonia will be reviewed here. Community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, pneumonia due to specific pathogens, empyema, and lung abscess are discussed separately.

Poor dental hygiene is also associated with increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, presumably due to the microbes and their high concentrations in the inoculum.</p><p>Increasing age is an important risk factor for aspiration pneumonia, with patients requiring care in long-term care facilities and those with comorbidities being particularly vulnerable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Risk factors for aspiration pneumonia were examined in a prospective population-based study of 1946 hospitalized patients with pneumonia admitted from continuing care facilities (CCFs) or the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ten percent of patients with community-acquired pneumonia had aspirated compared with 30 percent of those with CCF-acquired pneumonia. The risk factors for aspiration differed between the two groups. The most common risk factors for those with community-acquired aspiration pneumonia included impaired consciousness due to alcohol, drugs, or hepatic failure, whereas 72 percent of those with CCF-acquired aspiration pneumonia had neurologic disease that resulted in dysphagia. In another report that included 134 older adult patients (mean age 84 years), 55 percent had oropharyngeal dysphagia based on a water swallow test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>There is an association between use of acid-suppressive medications and community-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The assumed common mechanism in all of these conditions is loss of the gastric acid barrier resulting in a higher bacterial load in the lung when aspiration of gastric contents, which is both common and subtle, occurs.

Dysphagia can easily be confirmed with a bedside swallowing test using fluids in various volumes and consistencies. Some geriatricians also suggest pulse oximetry following a 10 cc fluid challenge as a simple and safe bedside test for identifying stroke patients who need fluid restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. More sensitive methods to more formally assess dysphagia are video fluoroscopic swallow studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] and endoscopic evaluations.

Nevertheless, a subsequent systematic review of randomized controlled trials of such measures found insufficient data to assess effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent randomized trial compared chin-down position and oral feedings of two consistencies (nectar thickened or honey thickened) on the incidence of aspiration as assessed by videofluorography in 711 patients with dementia or Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Significantly more patients aspirated on thin liquids using the chin-down posture (68 percent) than when using nectar-thickened liquids (63 percent) or honey-thickened liquids (53 percent). However, a separate report evaluating the incidence of pneumonia at three months in a subset of 515 patients found no significant difference between the two groups (9.8 versus 11.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

It might have been difficult to detect a difference between the groups since upright positioning during feeding is practiced routinely in nursing homes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and oral hygiene is also a common part of usual nursing home care.</p><p/><p>Techniques for the prevention of aspiration in hospitalized patients are discussed separately.

The three syndromes that are most frequently seen clinically and best studied are chemical pneumonitis, bacterial infection, and airway obstruction. Although there may occasionally be overlap and inability to classify individual cases, this classification is essential to an understanding of aspiration pneumonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66505 \">table 2</a>). An alternative classification is &quot;aspiration pneumonitis&quot; in reference to lung injury due to gastric acid and &quot;aspiration pneumonia&quot; with pneumonia due to bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term chemical pneumonitis refers to the aspiration of substances that are toxic to the lower airways, independent of bacterial infection. The prototype and best studied clinical example is chemical pneumonitis associated with the aspiration of gastric acid first described by Mendelson in 1946 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and sometimes referred to as Mendelson's syndrome.</p><p>The original series included 61 obstetrical patients who aspirated gastric contents during ether anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Respiratory distress and cyanosis rapidly followed, usually within two hours of a witnessed aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Chest radiographs showed infiltrates that were usually located in one or both lower lobes. Despite the initial severity of the illness, all 61 patients had a rapid clinical recovery within 24 to 36 hours, with radiographic resolution within four to seven days without the use of antimicrobial therapy.</p><p>Subsequent studies have shown that this form of aspiration pneumonia commonly follows a more fulminant course that may result in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In patients with aspiration pneumonia resulting in ARDS, blood gas studies usually show that the partial pressure of oxygen is reduced, accompanied by a normal or low partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> with respiratory alkalosis. Factors that contribute to hypoxemia include pulmonary edema, reduced surfactant activity, reflex airway closure, alveolar hemorrhage, and hyaline membrane formation. Pulmonary function tests show decreased compliance, abnormal ventilation-perfusion, and reduced diffusing capacity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major explanation for the difference in the clinical course of chemical pneumonitis since the initial report of the entity by Mendelson in 1946 is differences in the type of patients who develop this complication. Mendelson described healthy, young obstetrical patients, whereas the subjects of subsequent reports were often older, debilitated, or burdened with defined comorbid conditions.</p><p>Bile may also elicit an inflammatory response in the lungs and has been found frequently in endotracheal tubes of patients on ventilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of acid pneumonitis has been studied extensively in experimental animals using intratracheal installation of acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. These animal models require an inoculum that has a pH of &le;2.5 and that is relatively large (usually 1 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span>. This would translate to an inoculum of at least 25 mL of gastric acid in adult humans. It is probable that smaller volumes produce a more subtle process that either escapes clinical detection or causes a less fulminant form of pneumonitis. The clinical observation that patients with esophageal or gastric reflux experience frequent bouts of recurrent pneumonitis, often accompanied by pulmonary fibrosis, supports this concept [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>The pathologic changes in the preceding animal models of acid pneumonitis evolve rapidly. Within three minutes, there is atelectasis, peribronchial hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, and degeneration of bronchial epithelial cells. By four hours, the alveolar spaces are filled with polymorphonuclear leukocytes and fibrin. Hyaline membranes are seen within 48 hours. The lung at this time is also grossly edematous and hemorrhagic with alveolar consolidation.</p><p>All of the findings described above have also been noted on autopsy of patients with fatal aspiration pneumonia. The presumed mechanism is the release of proinflammatory cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a rabbit model, administration of an anti-IL-8 monoclonal antibody decreased IL-8 levels, neutrophil sequestration in air spaces, and prevented the acid-mediated abnormalities in oxygenation and extravascular lung water seen in control animals given hydrochloric acid into the lungs without anti-IL-8 antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a rat model, TNF-alpha levels in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and neutrophil sequestration were reduced in animals treated with a drug that inhibits the complement cascade at C5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

The dependent lobes in the upright position are the lower lobes. However, aspiration that occurs while patients are in the recumbent position may result in infection in the superior segments of the lower lobes and the posterior segments of the upper lobes.</p><p/><p>The course of this disease varies. In one retrospective review of 50 cases, three outcomes were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>12 percent of patients had a fulminant course and died shortly after aspiration, presumably from ARDS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>62 percent had a rapid clinical improvement with clearing of the chest radiograph</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>26 percent had initial rapid improvement but then developed new expanding infiltrates on chest radiograph, which probably represented secondary bacterial infection or the development of ARDS superimposed on the acid-injured lung</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of acid pneumonitis is usually presumptive based upon the clinical features and course noted above. After a suspected aspiration, chest radiograph abnormalities typically appear within two hours.

However, this maneuver will not protect the lungs from chemical injury, which occurs instantly in a manner that has been compared with a &quot;flash burn&quot;; the acid inoculum is rapidly neutralized by the physiologic response.</p><p>The major therapeutic approach is to support pulmonary function. Studies in animal models show benefit from positive-pressure ventilation, high molecular weight colloids given intravenously, and sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> infused into the pulmonary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>].

Animal studies have shown variable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>], but studies in humans have generally been unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The administration of glucocorticoids for acute respiratory distress syndrome has also been controversial and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-investigational-or-ineffective-pharmacotherapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Investigational or ineffective pharmacotherapy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies in experimental animals show that the acid-injured lung is highly susceptible to bacterial challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], and clinical studies show 13 to 26 percent of patients acquire pulmonary superinfections during the course of recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/25,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,48,49</a>]. Antimicrobial agents are commonly given because of the difficulty in excluding bacterial infection as a contributing or primary factor in patients with aspiration. In patients who are severely ill, the empiric use of antibiotics is appropriate. However, if no infiltrates develop after 48 to 72 hours, it is appropriate to stop antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Choice of regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>Some patients with chemical pneumonitis will have pulmonary infiltrates early following the aspiration event. In patients who are initially given antibiotics but who defervesce rapidly, it is appropriate to repeat a chest radiograph and discontinue antibiotics if the infiltrates and signs and symptoms of pneumonia have resolved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">BACTERIAL INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common form of aspiration pneumonia is caused by bacteria that normally reside in the upper airways or stomach. Historically, aspiration pneumonia has usually referred to an infection caused by less virulent bacteria, primarily oral anaerobes and streptococci, which are common constituents of the normal flora in a susceptible host prone to aspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67569 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. More recent studies have infrequently included adequate specimens for meaningful anaerobic culture. Nevertheless, the more recent work has disputed the dominance of anaerobic bacteria in aspiration pneumonia, with emphasis on the more common and more virulent bacteria encountered in hospital-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia such as <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, and other aerobic or facultative gram-negative bacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/16,51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,51-54</a>].</p><p>These differences in pathogens are best explained by variations in setting (community, chronic care facility, or hospital), presentation (acute versus subacute onset), sampling method to avoid upper airway specimen contamination (transtracheal aspiration, protected brush catheter, or transthoracic aspiration versus expectorated sputum or routine bronchoscopy), specimen handling, quality of the microbiologic testing, and prior use of antimicrobials. There is no question that sputum specimens from patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, even transtracheal aspiration specimens processed in specialized labs, show high yields of aerobic pathogens often in combination with obligate anaerobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. It also appears that the late sequelae of anaerobic lung infections, such as lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia, and empyema, are less common than they were in the past for unknown reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43493647\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaerobic bacteria are the dominant organisms in the upper airways. The critical role of these microbes in aspiration pneumonia, and its sequelae including lung abscess, and empyema was established in the 1970s in studies employing careful techniques for the isolation of anaerobes with transtracheal aspiration as a method to obtain uncontaminated specimens from the lower airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/23,56-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,56-65</a>]. Expectorated sputum is unsuitable for anaerobic culture because of inevitable contamination by the normal flora of the mouth. There is a limited experience with quantitative cultures of specimens obtained at bronchoscopy by a protected brush or bronchoalveolar lavage, but available data suggest these may be suitable when combined with high-quality anaerobic cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/61,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,66,67</a>].</p><p>Other problems are that anaerobic bacteria are difficult to cultivate and that identification of these microbes is time consuming, expensive, and tedious. The microbiology results are therefore often not available until long after treatment decisions have been made. Susceptibility testing is not generally performed since these results are generally predictable based on isolate identification. Clinical laboratories will not do anaerobic cultures on specimens that have contamination of normal flora. In current practice, anaerobic bacteria are virtually never detected in pulmonary infections due to lack of access to specimens that are uncontaminated with the normal flora of the upper airways. Specimens with well-established validity for anaerobic culture include transthoracic needle aspirate, transtracheal aspirates, and pleural fluid. If anaerobic cultures are done, the quality of the work is likely to be variable depending on the expertise and the resources of the laboratory. A concern even with high-quality laboratories is that it may take several days or even weeks before the complete report is available. This is often long after the initial antibiotic regimen is selected so that early communication with the laboratory regarding Gram stain results and relative concentrations are important. Growth of aerobes with be noted before growth of anaerobes. The yield of anaerobes using transtracheal or transthoracic aspiration in patients with aspiration pneumonia is 62 to 93 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/58,59,68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59,68-70</a>].</p><p>The major anaerobes that have been isolated from pulmonary infections are <em>Peptostreptococcus</em>, <em>Fusobacterium nucleatum</em>, <em>Prevotella</em>, <em>Bacteroides melaninogenicus</em>, and other <em>Bacteroides </em>spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/56-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-60</a>]. A subsequent prospective study of 95 patients from a long-term care facility admitted to an intensive care unit with pneumonia and risk factors for aspiration found that gram-negative bacilli were the most common isolates (49 percent), followed by anaerobes (16 percent) and <em>S. aureus </em>(12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Of the 43 patients with gram-negative bacilli isolated, 14 percent also had anaerobes recovered.</p><p>Expected findings on Gram stain include fusiform gram-negative bacilli (<em>F. nucleatum</em>), small, delicate gram-negative bacilli <em>(B. melaninogenicus</em>), long gram-negative bacilli (<em>Fusobacterium necrophorum)</em>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gram-positive cocci in chains (<em>Peptostreptococcus</em> and oral streptococci).</p><p>Most patients with aspiration pneumonia acquired in the community have a mixed infection that includes aerobes and anaerobes. A report from Japan using fine needle transthoracic aspiration or a protected brush catheter to obtain cultures in 212 patients with lung abscess showed streptococci to be the most common pathogens (60 percent of patients) and anaerobes to be the second most common (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. By contrast, patients with hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia commonly involve a mixture of anaerobes and gram-negative bacilli or <em>S. aureus</em>; therapy is usually directed at both the anaerobes and aerobes in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/55,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,59</a>], but the role of the anaerobes in this setting is unclear. One explanation for the difference in organisms accompanying anaerobic bacteria in hospitalized patients is the high frequency of upper airway colonization by aerobic pathogens, especially gram-negative bacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Most of the aerobic pathogens that are important for treatment decisions are easily recovered from a good quality expectorated sputum specimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presenting findings in aspiration pneumonia due to bacterial infection are highly variable depending upon the time the patient is seen during course of the infection, the bacteria involved, and the status of the host. Compared with most cases of community-acquired pneumonia, the tempo of aspiration pneumonia involving anaerobes often evolves slowly, and chills are uncommon. There is usually an association with periodontal disease, and this complication is less common in patients with good dental hygiene and those who are edentulous. Hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia often involves <em>S. aureus </em>or gram-negative bacilli, which commonly colonize the oral cavity of hospitalized patients.</p><p>Most patients present with the common manifestations of pneumonia, including cough, fever, purulent sputum, and dyspnea.

These agents are no longer favored because of high levels of resistance to beta-lactams (eg, penicillin) and the risk of <em>C. difficile</em> infection with clindamycin.

In addition, fluoroquinolones are associated with a higher risk of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection than certain other antibiotic classes. (See <a href=\"#H1393003980\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology#H402660\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clostridium difficile infection in adults: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic use'</a>.)</p><p>The use of other agents commonly employed for pulmonary infections such as macrolides, tetracyclines, and cephalosporins has not been systematically studied in aspiration pneumonia.

However, in patients with poor dentition, we generally use a regimen with activity against both aerobes and anaerobes. When there is a perceived need to treat anaerobic bacteria as well as resistant aerobic gram-negative bacilli (eg, in patients known to be colonized with resistant gram-negative bacilli or patients who have received IV antibiotics within the past 90 days), we suggest a carbapenem (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> since these agents will cover virtually all anaerobes as well as most aerobic gram-negative bacilli.

The former presents acutely with cough, fever, and dyspnea; the latter often presents with a mass seen on imaging in an asymptomatic patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are usually two requirements to produce aspiration pneumonia:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Compromise in the usual defenses that protect the lower airways including glottic closure, cough reflex, and other clearing mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56501 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An inoculum deleterious to the lower airways by a direct toxic effect, stimulation of an inflammatory process from a large enough bacterial inoculum, or obstruction due to a sufficient volume of material or particulate matter. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three syndromes that are most frequently seen clinically and best studied are chemical pneumonitis, bacterial infection, and airway obstruction. Although there may occasionally be overlap and inability to classify individual cases, this classification is essential to an understanding of aspiration pneumonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66505 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term chemical pneumonitis refers to the aspiration of substances that are toxic to the lower airways, independent of bacterial infection. The prototype and best studied clinical example is chemical pneumonitis associated with the aspiration of gastric acid. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Chemical pneumonitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an observed aspiration should have immediate tracheal suction to clear fluids and particulate matter that may cause obstruction. However, this maneuver will not protect the lungs from chemical injury, which occurs instantly in a manner that has been compared with a &quot;flash burn.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial agents are commonly given following a witnessed aspiration because of the difficulty in excluding bacterial infection as a contributing or primary factor. In patients who are severely ill, the empiric use of antibiotics is appropriate. However, if no infiltrates develop after 48 to 72 hours, it is appropriate to stop antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H3866772580\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common form of aspiration pneumonia is infection caused by bacteria that normally reside in the upper airways or stomach. Most patients with aspiration pneumonia acquired in the community have a mixed bacterial infection that includes strict anaerobes and facultative anaerobes such as oral streptococci (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67569 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Bacterial infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When anaerobic bacteria are probable pathogens in aspiration pneumonia and parenteral therapy is required, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-and-sulbactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin-sulbactam</a> (1.5 to 3 g IV every 6 hours) as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients who are not severely ill and who can tolerate an oral regimen, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> (875 mg orally twice daily) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Alternative regimens are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Choice of regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hospital-acquired aspiration pneumonia, most authorities feel that the companion aerobic bacteria, especially gram-negative bacilli and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, are more important than the anaerobes, are generally easily detected with heavy growth from adequate specimens, and that therapy should be directed at these organisms. However, in patients with poor dentition, we generally use a regimen with activity against both aerobes and anaerobes. When there is a perceived need to treat anaerobic bacteria as well as the aerobic gram-negative bacilli, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> since these agents will cover virtually all anaerobes as well as most aerobic gram-negative bacilli (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In patients with risk factors for methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA; eg, colonization with MRSA), we also suggest an agent with activity against MRSA (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>), but, if MRSA is not detected, then this agent should be discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Choice of regimen'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are initially treated with parenteral antibiotics can be switched to oral antibiotics when they are improving clinically, hemodynamically stable, able to take oral medications, and have a normally functioning gastrointestinal tract. For most patients, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> (875 mg orally twice daily) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients who have a serious allergy (eg, an IgE-mediated reaction) to penicillin, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (450 mg orally three times daily) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H444191891\" class=\"local\">'Switch to oral antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duration of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia is arbitrary and not well studied. The usual duration of therapy for cases that are not complicated by cavitation or empyema is 7 days. As some patients initially thought to have aspiration pneumonia actually have chemical pneumonitis, it is appropriate to repeat a chest radiograph in those who defervesce rapidly and discontinue antibiotics if the infiltrates and signs and symptoms of pneumonia have resolved. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspiration pneumonia may involve fluid or particulate matter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F100988\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100988 \">image 4</a>), which are not inherently toxic to the lung but can cause airway obstruction or reflex airway closure. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">BERSON W, ADRIANI J.
