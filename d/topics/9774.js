Ninety-nine percent of natural rubber comes from one source: the sap-like fluid (latex) from the commercial rubber tree, <em>Hevea brasiliensis</em> (Hev b), grown in Africa and Southeast Asia (Thailand, Indochina, Malaysia, and India) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A tube-like network of laticifer cells beneath the <em>H. brasiliensis</em> tree bark contains natural rubber (polymeric hydrocarbon 1,4 cis-polyisoprene), water, and cytoplasmic organelles. In addition, the cytoplasm contains a variety of enzymes and structural proteins that are involved in biosynthesis of polyisoprene, coagulation of latex, and plant defense against microbes. A number of these proteins are known to be potent allergens that elicit human immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody, leading to sensitization in exposed individuals and a spectrum of allergic reactions upon subsequent exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>This topic gives an overview of latex processing and latex allergens and discusses the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of latex allergy. The management of latex allergy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=latex-allergy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Latex allergy: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEVEA LATEX ALLERGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 250 different natural rubber latex polypeptides have been identified, of which 60 are able to bind human immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody. Only 15 of the principal allergens have been given official numbers (<em>H. brasiliensis</em> [Hev b] 1 through Hev b 15) by the International Nomenclature Committee of Allergens in the International Union of Immunological Societies (IUIS). These allergenic proteins are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71927 \">table 1</a>), including their molecular weight, plant family, and any known crossreactivity to structurally similar food, pollen, and mold allergens. The 15 allergenic <em>Hevea</em> proteins are involved in a broad range of activities in the rubber tree, including rubber biosynthesis, disease resistance, structure, and housekeeping. Nine additional <em>Hevea</em> proteins that can induce IgE antibody have been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71927 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Hev b 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.02, 7.01, and 13 have been identified as the most highly sensitizing of the <em>Hevea </em>allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. There is disagreement as to the relative clinical importance of certain <em>Hevea</em> allergens, such as Hev b 2 and Hev b 13. However, this discussion is largely academic because management of an individual with latex allergy involves avoidance of exposure to all Hev b allergens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hevea indicator allergens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four <em>Hevea</em> proteins are particularly useful as &quot;indicator&quot; allergens for assessment of the allergen content of rubber products or as markers of the presence of latex in the environment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71927 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hev b 1 (rubber elongation factor) and Hev b 3 (prenyltransferase) are associated with the surface of the polyisoprene rubber particle. These two allergens are more difficult to aerosolize, and, therefore, sensitization (IgE antibody production) to Hev b 1 and 3 requires direct mucosal exposure to <em>Hevea</em> rubber products that can occur during surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hev b 5 (acidic protein) and Hev b 6.<span class=\"nowrap\">01/6</span>.02 (mature hevein) are soluble allergens that are present in the latex cytosol or C serum. Using recombinant latex allergens, Hev b 5 and 6.<span class=\"nowrap\">01/6</span>.02 have been identified as major allergens involved in sensitizing health care workers. These proteins are released from dipped rubber products, mainly latex gloves, and transported via aerosolized powder used for glove donning or sloughed directly into the environment. Exposure to these allergens through direct contact or inhalation occurs most frequently in occupations in which protective rubber gloves are frequently worn.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-sensitization among latex, fruit, and pollen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 30 to 50 percent of individuals who are allergic to latex show an associated hypersensitivity to certain plant-derived foods, especially fresh fruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This is called latex-fruit or latex-food syndrome. Most patients with latex-food syndrome react to only a small number of foods. However, the reactions can be serious. In one case series, up to 50 percent of the reported food reactions were anaphylactic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Foods that contain cross-reactive allergens include banana, kiwi, avocado, chestnut, papaya, white potato, and tomato (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60713\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60713 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-19</a>]. The Hev b allergens that have structural homology with selected proteins in these plant foods are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71927 \">table 1</a>). The major panallergen responsible for much of the fruit-latex crossreactivity is a defense-related protein (class 1 chitinase) that displays structural homology to Hev b 6.01 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Hev b 5 possesses homology with an acidic protein in kiwi fruit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Hev b 6.02 (mature hevein) shares structural homology with wheat germ agglutinin and endochitinases in avocado and banana [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24,25</a>]. The Hev b 7 homologues (Hev b 7.01 and Hev b 7.02) are esterases that share structural homology with patatin (Sol t 1), the major storage protein in potato tubers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Hev b 8 is a profilin (actin-binding protein) that contributes to clinically important crossreactivity with other highly sensitizing profilins from tree, grass, and weed pollens and foods (eg, the birch allergen, Bet v 2 and the Timothy grass allergen, Phl p 12).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HEVEA LATEX PROCESSING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Hevea</em> latex can be separated by centrifugation into three discrete layers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,27</a>]. The top layer contains particles of natural rubber (approximately 27 percent), which are water insoluble and rich in Hev b 1 and 3. The middle fraction or C serum (latex cytosol; approximately 48 percent) contains soluble proteins, including plant enzymes. This fraction contains Hev b 5, 7, 8, and 9. The lower layer contains the lutoid pellet (B-serum; approximately 30 percent), which is composed of luciferous organelles that contain hevamines with chitinase and lysozyme activity and hevein, a fungitoxic protein. It is rich in Hev b 2, 4, 6.<span class=\"nowrap\">01/6</span>.02, 7, 10, 11, and 13. Both the B and C serum proteins are water soluble. A mixture of B and C serum proteins have been used to prepare diagnostic skin test extracts.</p><p>The milky fluid or latex from the rubber tree is processed by one of two pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 90 percent of <em>Hevea</em> latex is acid coagulated into dry sheets or crumbled particles and used to manufacture molded rubber products (eg, pneumatic tires for vehicles, catheters, syringe plungers, vial stoppers, and shoe soles). This processing involves prolonged treatment at high temperatures, which decreases allergenicity. Solid rubber products contain low levels of latex allergens, mainly Hev b 1 and Hev b 3.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The remaining 10 percent of <em>Hevea</em> latex is ammoniated to prevent bacterial growth. A variety of low-molecular-weight chemical additives (eg, antioxidants, accelerators, preservatives) are often used in the process. Ammoniated latex is used to manufacture dipped rubber products on porcelain molds (eg, medical gloves, condoms, catheters, and toy balloons). Dipped rubber products contain higher levels of latex allergens, including Hev b 5, Hev b 6, and Hev b 13, and the majority of allergic reactions to <em>Hevea</em> latex proteins result from exposure to dipped rubber products. Total extractable latex protein is significantly reduced in commercially produced latex gloves by treatment with natural proteases (papain, bromelain) following dipping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Even with these procedures that minimize protein content, results of a 2016 study confirm that concerning levels of allergenic latex protein from 215 to 1308 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> remain in 50 percent of commercial latex gloves tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p>Medical <em>Hevea</em> latex gloves can be categorized by their application and degree of sterilization (nonsterile examination gloves and sterile procedure and surgeon gloves) and by the presence or absence of donning powder (powdered versus powder free). Allergenic protein that adheres to cornstarch donning powder readily distributes into the environment following powdered glove use. Allergic airway symptoms can result from the aerosolized latex allergen but rarely from the cornstarch powder itself. Powder-free latex gloves generally contain the lowest levels of allergens as a result of a final chlorination wash process. Avoidance of <em>Hevea</em> latex products in general and, specifically, powdered latex products is the most efficient means of reducing <em>Hevea</em> latex allergen exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of latex <span class=\"nowrap\">sensitization/allergy</span> skyrocketed in the mid- to late-1990s due to a significant increase in the use of latex gloves by clinicians and other health care employees (clinicians, nurses, dentists, laboratory workers, housekeepers, emergency medical technicians, patient transporters) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Subsequent widespread avoidance of powdered latex gloves in many hospitals resulted in a marked decrease in the number of new cases of latex allergy among health care workers and patients receiving multiple surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, latex allergy continues to be a serious issue in countries where powdered latex gloves are still widely used by medical personnel, patient groups (eg dialysis patients), and in select occupations (eg, florists, food handlers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-39</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Latex allergy epidemic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors contributed to the epidemic of latex allergy in North America and Europe. In 1992, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issued the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard that required protective glove use. The introduction of &quot;universal precautions&quot; increased the use of medical gloves. This increased demand for natural rubber latex came at a time when the supply of latex was limited. Thus, latex was collected from increasingly younger trees that had been treated with stimulants to produce higher levels of latex per tree.</p><p>Both tapping of younger trees and the use of stimulant chemicals increased the level of allergenic proteins in the collected latex. The latex was processed without the customary delay when it arrived at the manufacturing facility, rather than being stored for extended periods. This rapid turnover of latex minimized the extent of protein denaturation that naturally occurs during storage at high pH caused by the presence of ammonia. Together, these factors increased the amount of allergenic protein in the raw material and ultimately in the finished latex medical gloves. Higher levels of protein exacerbated the problem of latex allergy among the medical and dental communities by increasing <em>H. brasiliensis</em> allergen exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence in the general population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevalence estimates of sensitization to latex allergens are highly dependent upon the population studied and the techniques and reagents used to identify cases (questionnaire, immunoglobulin E [IgE] antibody skin <span class=\"nowrap\">testing/serology</span> evaluation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. As an example, diagnostic procedures using skin test or serology reagents will be biased toward detecting individuals sensitized to Hev b 6.02 because this protein is the most abundant allergen in latex extracts.</p><p><em>Hevea</em> latex sensitization (IgE antibody positivity) among the general population was estimated at 3 to 9.5 percent in the mid-1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. The prevalence of latex sensitization in the general population fell to &lt;1 percent by 2006 in countries where <em>Hevea</em> latex avoidance was promoted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Rates of clinical IgE-mediated allergy are even lower. However, these numbers do not include individuals with allergic contact dermatitis to latex, a reaction that is not IgE mediated. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence in the health care community</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant numbers of cases of <em>Hevea</em> latex allergy were identified in the late 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. By 1991, latex allergy was such a serious health issue that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convened an international symposium on latex allergy. Increased occupational exposure to <em>Hevea</em> allergens occurred principally among the medical and dental communities. Use of latex gloves resulted in both direct cutaneous contact with <em>Hevea</em> allergens and inhalation of aerosolized <em>Hevea</em> allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>Latex allergy achieved epidemic proportions in the medical community by the mid-1990s. An estimated prevalence of sensitization among the general health care worker population in one study was 12.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A similar prevalence of sensitization to <em>Hevea</em> allergens of 10.7 percent was reported for routinely exposed operating room nurses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Rates fell to approximately 4 to 7 percent with the introduction of powder-free gloves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,51,52</a>]. It can be assumed that rates have decreased even further with the increased use of nonlatex gloves. However, new cases of latex allergy continue as a result of inadvertent exposures from high levels of <em>Hevea</em> allergen in less obvious sources, such as toy balloons and dental dams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Latex allergy continues to be a problem for health care workers in Asian countries that have not effectively instituted avoidance practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence in patients receiving multiple surgeries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A second high-risk group involved individuals who were frequently exposed to latex as a result of multiple surgeries, especially abdominal or genitourinary surgery. The most high-profile group was children with spina bifida who were sensitized through direct mucosal exposure to <em>Hevea</em> rubber products as a result of multiple surgeries early in life and frequent bladder catheterization and manual rectal disimpaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. It has been estimated that between one-third and two-thirds of children who underwent their surgeries in the 1990s became sensitized to <em>Hevea</em> allergens (developed IgE antibodies to latex allergens). A significant proportion manifested latex-induced allergic reactions upon subsequent exposure to latex gloves or urinary catheters. The rate of latex sensitization and allergy has decreased significantly in children with spina bifida since the implementation of latex avoidance compared with historical controls (55 versus 5 percent for sensitization and 37 versus 0.8 percent for allergy, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In some parts of the world, the prevalence of latex allergy in patients with myelomeningocele remains high at 19.5 percent, and &gt;5 surgeries is the single most important risk factor for this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main risk factors for latex allergy are occupational exposure and an atopic tendency.

The most reliable indicator of allergy is a strong clinical history, associating exposure and symptoms. Confirmatory tests (skin tests, serology, and provocation) are limited by reagent availability, varying reagent <span class=\"nowrap\">sensitivity/specificity</span> and composition, and significant potential risks for triggering serious reactions. Thus, a negative test in the setting of high clinical suspicion does not necessarily rule out latex allergy.

Associated risk factors include hand dermatitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">fruit/vegetable</span> allergy, and atopy (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above).

Commercially available skin test extracts are prepared using sterile filtered C serum from either nonammoniated or ammoniated <em>Hevea</em> latex, which is then glycerinated to increase its shelf life. The C serum contains both soluble and lutoid allergens that are released from the rubber particles. The nonammoniated form of C serum used in the skin test reagents in Europe is remarkably comprehensive in its allergen composition.</p><p>The skin test procedure involves performing a puncture with one of several lancet devices through a drop of latex extract at sequential concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> of protein. The results are read after 15 minutes and compared with the positive histamine and negative saline controls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Prick/puncture method'</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity ranged from 65 to 96 percent and specificity from 88 to 94 percent for use of the available extract products in pediatric patients with a history of urticaria, rhinoconjunctivitis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asthma suspected to be triggered by natural rubber latex allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>There is no commercial skin test reagent available in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. This has forced allergists in the United States who want to attempt skin testing to create extracts prepared in the office from <em>Hevea</em> latex products that vary widely in their allergen content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>]. Extracts prepared from examination gloves are unstable, uncharacterized, and of highly variable potency. The inability to document the presence and content of <em>Hevea</em> allergens in office-prepared extracts has led to concerns about false-negative diagnostic skin test results. Another concern is the potential for systemic reactions occurring as a result of skin testing with nonstandardized <em>Hevea</em> extracts due to potentially high levels of <em>Hevea</em> allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. For these reasons, use of these preparations is discouraged.</p><p>Puncturing through a <em>Hevea</em>-containing product (powdered glove) as an alternative or secondary testing method is also not encouraged, since it is not possible to know how much allergen has been distributed into the skin. There is a risk of a systemic allergic reaction from high-dose exposure or inadvertent inhalation with this testing method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/56,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Serology testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A preferred alternative to a <span class=\"nowrap\">prick/puncture</span> skin test for confirming sensitization when commercial skin test reagents are not available is the measurement of <em>Hevea</em> latex-specific IgE antibody in serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/latex-allergy-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/56,75,77,82,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,75,77,82,86</a>].

A commercial version of this chip microarray (ImmunoCAP-ISAC) that contains recombinant Hev b 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8 is under investigation.

Patients who are uncertain as to whether they tolerate latex-related foods that they may encounter are not routinely evaluated for sensitization to these foods. Rather, skin prick testing with extracts or fresh food or serum food-specific IgE testing and possibly oral challenge are reserved for patients with latex allergy who specifically request evaluation for possible cross-sensitization. The primary reason for limiting testing is that performing skin or serology testing in the absence of a positive history of a reaction to a cross-reactive food can lead to &quot;positive&quot; IgE antibody results of unknown clinical significance and inappropriate avoidance practices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67228893\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
