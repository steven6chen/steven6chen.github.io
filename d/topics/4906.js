For this reason, it is imperative that health care providers identify overweight and obese children so that counseling and treatment can be provided.</p><p>The definition, epidemiology, and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents will be presented here. Comorbidities of obesity in children and adolescents and the clinical evaluation of the obese child or adolescent are discussed separately.

However, the methods used to directly measure body fat are not available in daily practice. For this reason, obesity usually is assessed by the relationship between weight and height (ie, anthropometrics), which provides an estimate of body fat that is sufficiently accurate for clinical purposes.</p><p>The body mass index (BMI) is the accepted standard measure of overweight and obesity for children two years of age and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. BMI provides a guideline for weight in relation to height and is equal to the body weight (in kilograms) divided by the height (in meters) squared (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71431 \">table 1</a>). Other measures of childhood obesity, including weight-for-height (which is particularly useful for the child younger than two years), measures of regional fat distribution (eg, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio), and the growth standards developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-body-composition-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of body composition in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;, section on 'Growth standards'</a>.)</p><p>Adults with a BMI between 25 and 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> are considered overweight; those with a BMI &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> are considered to be obese. Obesity in adults is subcategorized as class I (BMI &ge;30 to 35), class II (BMI &ge;35 to 40), and class III (BMI &ge;40). Because children grow in height as well as weight, the norms for BMI in children vary with age and sex. In 2000, the National Center for Health Care Statistics and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) published BMI reference standards for children between the ages of 2 and 20 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60784%7EPEDS%2F68478\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60784 graphicRef68478 \">figure 1A-B</a>). BMI percentiles also can be determined using a calculator for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-percentiles-for-boys-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) and for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-percentiles-for-girls-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>).

Therefore, this threshold appears to define a group with medically significant obesity in children and adolescents. Adolescents with this severe degree of obesity should be treated within a tertiary care program utilizing a multidisciplinary pediatric weight management team. Treatment may include more intensive interventions operating via established protocols, such as medications, very-low-calorie diets, meal replacements, and weight loss surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Among obese six-year-old children with an obese parent, 50 percent remained obese as adults, and among obese 10- to 14-year-old children with an obese parent, 80 percent remained obese as adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Similar findings were reported in a large international cohort, in which 82 percent of individuals who were obese as children (age 11.4 &plusmn; 4.0 years) remained obese as adults at follow-up approximately 23 years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. A separate study used data from several large national datasets in the United States to simulate growth trajectories into adulthood, and predicted that almost 60 percent of all US children who are alive today will be obese by the time they reach 35 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The risk for adult obesity increases with age and childhood BMI. For children with severe obesity, tracking is strong and occurs early in life: a two year-old child with severe obesity has an 80 percent chance of being obese at age 35, while a five-year-old child with severe obesity has a 90 percent chance of remaining obese. These long-term studies must be interpreted with caution since the dietary habits and activity levels of today's children may differ from those of the children in the studies, thereby altering the risk of obesity in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Most adolescents with obesity will remain obese in adulthood. In a study of adolescents from a single city in the United States, obesity persisted into young adulthood in about two-thirds of adolescents, while one-third &quot;exited&quot; obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The severity of obesity during adolescence is an important predictor of whether the obesity is likely to persist into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,46</a>]. In a large population study in the United States, about 75 percent of adolescents with severe obesity (BMI &gt;120 percent of the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile) remained severely obese as adults (BMI &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Meanwhile, 8 percent of adolescents with more moderate obesity developed severe obesity as adults. In adolescents, the tracking of severe obesity is even stronger than in younger age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Whether gender affects the risk that obesity will persist into adulthood varies markedly among studies in different populations. In one study from 1980, approximately 80 percent of obese adolescent girls remained obese into adulthood, whereas approximately 30 percent of obese adolescent males did so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This was presumably related to changes in body composition that occur at puberty, when body fat decreases in boys and increases in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, in later cohorts, obesity in adolescent boys is more likely to be persistent, and the risk of persistent obesity is similar to that of girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. In one study from Australia, both boys and girls who were obese during adolescence had a 50 to 60 percent chance of remaining obese as young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

The contributions of specific environmental influences are the subject of considerable discussion and research. Environmental factors explain only part of obesity risk, but are important targets for treatment because they are potentially modifiable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. </p><p>Increasing trends in glycemic index of foods, sugar-containing beverages, portion sizes for prepared foods, fast food service, diminishing family presence at meals, decreasing structured physical activity, increasing use of computer-oriented play activity, school meal nutrition content, and elements of the built environment (eg, availability of sidewalks and playgrounds) have all been considered as causal influences on the rise in obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. In particular, a number of well-designed studies have shown associations between intake of sugar-containing beverages or low physical activity and obesity or metabolic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/63-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-70</a>]. Causal associations seem likely but are difficult to establish with certainty. </p><p>Results of individual studies testing interventions to prevent childhood obesity are variable. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions from the literature because interventions tested vary in form and intensity, the populations studied are heterogeneous and subject to selection bias, and there are many potential unmeasured confounders that could affect weight outcomes. Moreover, it appears that effects of lifestyle interventions on body mass index (BMI) are small at best, with substantial variation, and thus are not detectable without very large sample sizes. </p><p>Despite these limitations, meta-analyses conclude that interventions to prevent childhood obesity are generally effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. One meta-analysis reported that children enrolled in intervention groups had a mean reduction in adiposity as compared with control groups (standardized mean difference in BMI of -0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> [95% CI -0.21 to -0.09]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. While the effect size is small, this represents a clinically important difference across a population. The best supported strategies were school-based programs that enhance physical activity, nutrition education, and quality of food served at school, as well as parent-focused interventions designed to encourage children to be more active and reduce screen time. Studies targeting younger children (ages 6 to 12 years) were most effective. Because the intervention strategies and results varied widely among the included studies, the effect of each intervention component is not clear. In a separate meta-analysis, the strongest evidence was for school-based interventions emphasizing physical activity (with or without an associated dietary intervention), but with a home component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Accordingly, guidelines and policy statements in the United States have advocated improvements in nutrition quality for children, including consumption of a diverse, nutrient-dense diet, emphasizing vegetables, fruits, and whole grains; with quality protein sources and low-fat or non-fat milk and dairy; limited intake of sugar-sweetened beverages; modest fat content; and moderate portion sizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. In particular, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued policy statements discouraging access to sugar-sweetened beverages in schools, including soft drinks and beverages marketed for rehydration during sports, and encouraging clinicians to advocate for these goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>].

Moreover, a randomized trial demonstrated that reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages among overweight and obese adolescents was associated with a modest decrease in BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In a separate randomized trial in 5- to 12-year-old children (primarily normal-weight), consumption of one serving of an artificially sweetened beverage daily was associated with less weight gain and fat accumulation as compared with consumption of a sugar-sweetened beverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Of note, in a large observational study in adults, the association between obesity and sugar-sweetened beverages appeared to be mediated in part by genetic factors, which were quantified by a &quot;genetic-predisposition&quot; score, based on 32 BMI-associated loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p>In each of these studies, the observed effect sizes were small.

As examples, two studies found that energy expenditure of playing some common sport-simulating exergames was higher than that of sedentary games, but not as high as playing the sport itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/116,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">116,119</a>]. The energy expenditure depends on the game: in one study, energy expenditure during six different activity-enhancing games ranged 4.2 metabolic equivalents (mets) for Wii boxing to 7.1 mets for Sportwall, compared with 4.9 mets for walking at 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">miles/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. </p><p>The long-term effect of activity-enhancing games probably depends on the intensity and participant enjoyment of the game, as well as the activities replaced by the gaming. A small study reported that use of one of these games had no long-term effect on obesity status, and that use of the game declined sharply over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. On the other hand, other reports described good patient retention and clinically significant reductions in BMI among adolescent patients participating in a multifaceted obesity management program, which featured one-hour group exergaming sessions or provision of exergame equipment for home use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/122,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">122,123</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Sleep</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mounting evidence suggests an association between shortened sleep duration and obesity.

As an example, in a large longitudinal study, among pre-school aged children with early bedtimes (8:00 PM or earlier), 10 percent developed obesity by adolescence, compared with 23 percent of those with late bedtimes (9:00 PM or later) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. Children with early bedtimes had a relative risk of adolescent obesity of 0.48 compared with late bedtimes, after adjustment for several confounding variables, including maternal obesity, maternal education and income level. Additional support for a causal association comes from a short-term experimental study in which sleep deprivation for one week was associated with increased food intake, weight gain, and higher leptin levels as compared with the child's usual sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].

BMI provides a guideline for weight in relation to height and is equal to the body weight (in kilograms) divided by the height (in meters) squared (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71431 \">table 1</a>). Reference standards vary by age and sex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60784%7EPEDS%2F68478\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60784 graphicRef68478 \">figure 1A-B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children between 2 and 20 years of age, the following weight categories are used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78725\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78725 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Overweight</strong> &ndash; BMI between the 85th and 95th percentile for age and sex. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Obesity</strong> &ndash; BMI &ge;95th percentile for age and sex. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Severe obesity</strong> &ndash; BMI &ge;120 percent of the 95th percentile values, <strong>or</strong> a BMI &ge;35 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90747%7EPEDS%2F91083\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90747 graphicRef91083 \">figure 2A-B</a>). This corresponds to approximately the 99th percentile, or BMI Z-score &ge;2.33.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About one-third of children and adolescents in the United States are either overweight or obese (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101297\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101297 \">figure 3</a>). The prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents tripled from the late 1970s to 2000, and subsequently plateaued for most age and weight categories, although the prevalence of severe obesity continues to increase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62778\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62778 \">figure 4</a>). Several regions or subpopulations have shown slight decreases in childhood obesity since 2008. The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity also increased in many other resource-rich countries worldwide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68479\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68479 \">figure 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The likelihood of persistence of childhood obesity into adulthood is related to age, parental obesity, and severity of obesity. A substantial component of adolescent obesity is established before five years of age. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Persistence into adulthood'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of environmental factors probably contribute to the development of obesity in children, including increasing trends in glycemic index of foods, sugar-containing beverages, larger portion sizes for prepared foods, fast food service, diminishing family presence at meals, decreasing structured physical activity, shortened sleep duration, and changes in elements of the built environment (eg, availability of sidewalks and playgrounds). Television viewing is one of the best established environmental influences on the development of obesity during childhood. For a few children, medications (eg, certain psychoactive drugs) have an important causal role. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Environmental factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic factors play a permissive role and interact with environmental factors to produce obesity. Studies suggest that heritable factors are responsible for 40 to 85 percent of the variation in adiposity, but most of the genetic polymorphisms responsible have not yet been isolated. A few specific syndromes and single-gene defects which are linked to obesity in childhood have been identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70658\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70658 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76948\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76948 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrine causes of obesity are identified in less than 1 percent of children and adolescents with obesity. The disorders include hypothyroidism, cortisol excess (eg, the use of corticosteroid medication, Cushing syndrome), growth hormone deficiency, and pseudohypoparathyroidism. Most children with these problems have short stature <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypogonadism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63990\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63990 \">table 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothalamic lesions tend to cause rapidly progressive severe obesity, which is particularly difficult to treat. In the pediatric age group, hypothalamic obesity most often arises after surgical treatment for craniopharyngioma, and usually is associated with panhypopituitarism. Similar patterns may be caused by trauma, tumor, or inflammatory disease affecting the hypothalamus. (See <a href=\"#H272342934\" class=\"local\">'Hypothalamic obesity'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is increasing evidence to support a role for &quot;metabolic programming&quot; in the development of obesity. Metabolic programming refers to the concept that environmental and nutritional influences during critical periods in development, particularly during gestation, can have permanent effects on an individual's predisposition to obesity and metabolic disease. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic programming'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Strauss RS, Pollack HA.
