In a study of the natural history of HBV-related cirrhosis in the pre-nucleos(t)ide analogue era, the five-year survival was 71 percent for the entire group of patients, but only 14 percent for those with decompensated disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57621\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57621 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The initial results with liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis B in the 1980s were disappointing, with graft reinfection rates approaching 80 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In many patients, reinfection was associated with severe and rapidly progressive liver disease, resulting in two-year graft and patient survival of 50 percent compared to 80 percent in those transplanted for other types of chronic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. With these poor results and limited supply of donor organs, many centers and third-party payers abandoned liver transplantation for patients with chronic hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Since the late 1980s, the introduction of effective measures to prevent and treat reinfection using strategies involving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> (HBIG) and subsequently nucleos(t)ide analogues have significantly improved the outcome of liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. The overall survival of patients transplanted for HBV-related cirrhosis exceeds 85 percent at one year and 75 percent at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/7,10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10-14</a>]. Furthermore, rates of transplantation for HBV-related end-stage liver disease have dropped substantially, with a 24 percent decrease in liver transplantation waiting list registrations since 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HBV REINFECTION AFTER LIVER TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The high rate of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reinfection after liver transplantation is probably due to enhanced virus replication resulting from immunosuppression and direct stimulatory effects of steroid therapy on the glucocorticoid-responsive enhancer region of the HBV genome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

One study of 177 patients reported that HBV recurrence occurred in 50, 7.5, and 0 percent of patients whose serum HBV DNA at the time of transplant were higher than 100,000, 200 to 100,000, and less than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The authors concluded that serum HBV DNA higher than 100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (~20,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL)</span> at the time of transplant was associated with significantly higher risk of HBV recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">De novo HBV infection/reactivation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative recipient acquiring HBV infection following liver transplantation from a hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc)-positive donor is generally low, but rates as high as 80 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The risk of acquiring HBV infection may be higher from donors who are HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. One of the largest studies to address this issue found that hepatitis B (HBsAg-positive hepatitis) developed in 18 of 23 (78 percent) recipients of liver transplants from anti-HBc-positive donors, compared with only 3 of 651 (0.5 percent) recipients of livers from anti-HBc-negative donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The HBV infection was mild in most cases; 50 percent of patients had normal serum aminotransferases, while 85 percent had no or only mild inflammatory activity on liver biopsy one year after transplantation. Nevertheless, liver transplantation from an anti-HBc-positive donor was associated with a decreased four-year survival.</p><p>A second study looked at 64 patients who were anti-HBc negative and received a liver from a donor who was HBsAg negative but anti-HBc positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. De novo HBV infection developed in nine patients (14 percent). De novo HBV infection was not associated with an increased risk of death or graft rejection at one and five years, and no graft loss or death was attributed to de novo HBV infection.</p><p>Eliminating livers from anti-HBc-positive individuals could result in a significant reduction in the potential donor pool, particularly in countries where HBV infection is endemic. Optimal strategies to prevent de novo infection in this setting have not been established. Reserving livers that are anti-HBc positive for recipients with chronic hepatitis B is one potential approach, since such patients will be receiving hepatitis B antiviral prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]. Recipients who have hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-HBc at the time of transplantation are also less likely to develop de novo infection after receiving a graft from an anti-HBc-positive donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/22,24-26,29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24-26,29-34</a>]. The lowest risk of de novo infection is in recipients who are anti-HBs and anti-HBc positive. Intermediate risk is seen in recipients who are anti-HBs positive and anti-HBc negative (mean 21 percent) or are anti-HBs negative and anti-HBc positive (mean 12 percent). The highest risk is seen in patients who are both anti-HBs and anti-HBc negative (mean 76 percent).</p><p>Various prophylactic regimens have been reported to prevent de novo HBV infection when livers from HBsAg negative, anti-HBc-positive donors are transplanted into HBsAg-negative recipients. Many were based upon regimens that included <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, most studies involved small numbers of patients with short duration of follow-up. In a systematic review looking at patients who received livers from donors who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive, the rate of de novo HBV infection in 110 patients given lamivudine prophylaxis was 3.6 percent after a mean follow-up of 25 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Entecavir</a> and tenofovir, which are associated with lower rates of drug resistance, may be more appropriate as life-long treatment will be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>HBIG prophylaxis has been studied for recipients who are HBsAg negative. One study included 56 HBsAg-negative patients who received livers from HBsAg negative, anti-HBc-positive donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. HBV infection occurred in 8 of 45 (18 percent) recipients who received prophylaxis compared with 7 of 11 (64 percent) recipients who did not. The rate of infection was highest among HBV-seronegative patients who did not receive prophylaxis (five of five patients) and was intermediate among HBV-immune recipients (two of six patients; 33 percent). HBV-seronegative patients who received prophylaxis also had an intermediate rate of infection (6 of 19; 32 percent). Recipients who were HBV-immune and received prophylaxis had low rates of infection (2 of 26; 8 percent). These data confirm a high rate of transmission of HBV infection from liver grafts of HBsAg negative, anti-HBc-positive donors. The low efficacy of HBIG in preventing HBV transmission is not surprising because HBIG is not effective in inhibiting HBV replication in the liver.</p><p>HBIG prophylaxis has also been combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> with improved results compared with HBIG monotherapy. A systematic review examined patients who received livers from donors who were HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive. The rate of de novo HBV infection in the 73 patients who received HBIG and lamivudine prophylaxis was 3.6 percent after a mean follow-up of 31 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, the de novo infection rate for combination therapy with HBIG and lamivudine was similar to that seen for lamivudine monotherapy (2.7 percent), suggesting that the addition of HBIG to the regimen does not provide any added benefit.</p><p>De novo HBV infection has also been reported after liver transplantation from donors who are serologically negative for HBV markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/22,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,39,40</a>]. These donors are thought to have occult HBV infection because of the presence of HBV DNA in their sera or liver tissue. Although the risk of reactivation appears to be low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], routine HBV vaccination prior to liver transplantation may prevent this problem and should be recommended to all liver transplant candidates. Unfortunately, the success of hepatitis B vaccination in this group of older individuals with poor immune response secondary to cirrhosis has been disappointing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reactivation of HBV replication has also been reported in recipients who are HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive pretransplant, and received liver grafts from donors who are HBsAg and anti-HBc negative. In one study of 22 patients, HBV DNA was detected in the liver in five (23 percent) HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive patients pretransplant, and in two of these five patients post-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, none of the patients became HBsAg positive or developed clinical hepatitis post-transplant. These data have not been confirmed by other studies, and there is no evidence that prophylactic antiviral therapy is necessary in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HBV reinfection has traditionally been diagnosed by the reappearance of HBsAg in the serum. Most reinfected patients are also HBeAg positive and have high levels of circulating HBV DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Immunohistochemical staining of liver biopsies for HBsAg and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) usually shows intense staining.</p><p>Studies using PCR assays have demonstrated that HBV DNA can be detected in serum prior to the reappearance of HBsAg or elevation of aminotransferases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Conversely, studies in which a nucleos(t)ide analogue without HBIG is used to prevent HBV reinfection found that some patients remained HBsAg positive but had undetectable HBV DNA in serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. These findings suggest the need to re-examine the definition of HBV reinfection and the criteria for initiating rescue therapy.</p><p>Reinfection is almost always accompanied by recurrent liver disease, which is often severe and rapidly progressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. If untreated, cirrhosis occurs within one to two years of reinfection.</p><p>An unusual form of liver disease with severe cholestasis and rapidly progressive liver failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80015\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80015 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/42,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,45,46</a>], termed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, characterized by prominent cholestasis and extensive fibrosis, was observed in the 1990s. Liver injury in this condition is believed to be a result of direct cytopathic effects of HBV since liver biopsies usually show very high levels of both HBsAg and HBcAg expression. This condition is rarely seen now as a result of early diagnosis of HBV reinfection and availability of effective antiviral therapies.</p><p>Some patients have detectable levels of HBV DNA in liver or peripheral blood mononuclear cells when tested by sensitive PCR assays but remain HBsAg negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/47-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-51</a>]. Most of these patients do not have clinical or histologic evidence of recurrent hepatitis B. Whether these patients will eventually develop overt reinfection and recurrent liver disease remains to be determined. These observations underscore the importance of continuous prophylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF HBV REINFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reinfection includes use of antiviral therapy pre-transplant and continuation of antiviral therapy with or without hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) post-transplant.

However, liver failure may continue to progress since clinical improvement takes three to six months and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can still develop in patients who have clinical improvement. In patients who present late, the goal is to achieve viral suppression, thereby stabilizing liver disease, allowing the patient to receive a liver transplant, and (in those who proceed to transplant) decreasing the risk of HBV reinfection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice and timing of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiviral therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients with HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis and detectable serum HBV DNA, regardless of HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase levels. Although early studies used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, the high rate of drug resistance and the need for life-long treatment make this a suboptimal therapy. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Entecavir</a> is attractive as a first-line antiviral agent in nucleoside-na&iuml;ve transplant patients because it is more potent, has a low rate of drug resistance, and is not associated with nephrotoxicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83184\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83184 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Lactic acidosis in patients with severe liver dysfunction had been reported in case series, but the incidence is unclear, and in some cases, other factors such as sepsis may be contributory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. One series compared six patients with decompensated cirrhosis receiving entecavir with six patients with non-HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis who were not receiving entecavir. Among the patients receiving entecavir, lactic acidosis was seen in one patient who was suffering from septic shock. No lactic acidosis was seen among the patients not receiving entecavir. Lactic acidosis may be a class effect of nucleos(t)ide analogues. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Entecavir</a> has been compared with other agents in studies of patients with decompensated cirrhosis who have not yet undergone liver transplantation.

An improvement in the Child-Pugh score of two or more points was seen in 35 percent of patients receiving entecavir and 27 percent of patients receiving adefovir. The mean decreases in Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score from baseline were 2.6 and 1.7, respectively. The rate of serious adverse events was consistent with advanced liver disease and was similar between those treated with entecavir and adefovir (69 versus 66 percent). There was no significant difference between those treated with entecavir and adefovir with regard to HCC development (12 versus 20 percent) or mortality (23 versus 33 percent). Seven percent of patients treated with entecavir discontinued the medication due to an adverse event, compared with six percent of those treated with adefovir. </p><p>Another trial assigned 112 patients with HBV and decompensated cirrhosis to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a>, tenofovir, or tenofovir-emtricitabine and found results with entecavir to be similar to those with the other treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Treatment was discontinued due to a treatment-related adverse event in 9, 7, and 4 percent of patients, respectively, with a mortality rate at the end of the 48-week study of 9, 4, and 4 percent, respectively.</p><p>Many experts have recommended de novo combination therapy, but data in support of this approach are not available and it is unclear if combination therapy is superior to monotherapy with drugs that have a high genetic barrier to resistance such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> or tenofovir. In a report of a study comparing entecavir monotherapy with entecavir plus tenofovir combination therapy in 379 nucleos(t)ide-na&iuml;ve patients with compensated liver disease, there was no advantage of de novo combination therapy over monotherapy with regard to viral suppression, except in patients who were hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive and had very high HBV DNA levels (&gt;10<sup>8</sup> international <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Adefovir</a> is associated with a lower rate of drug resistance than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, but nephrotoxicity has been observed in up to 20 percent of pre- and post-liver transplant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. While many factors, such as hepatorenal syndrome and concomitant nephrotoxic medications, may contribute to impaired renal function, adefovir is not an ideal first-line antiviral in transplant patients because of its weak antiviral activity and a high rate of primary nonresponse, which is likely to be higher in patients who require dose reductions due to renal insufficiency.
