The monthly schedule causes more neutropenia and stomatitis, while the weekly schedule causes more diarrhea. Furthermore, five-day bolus regimen appears to be more toxic in women than in men.

Although objective response rates were significantly higher with cetuximab (69 versus 54 percent), median overall survival from the time of diagnosis was similar (32 months for cetuximab and 31.2 months for bevacizumab), as was median PFS (11.4 versus 11.3 months).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An intriguing retrospective reanalysis of data from this trial suggests that the site of the primary tumor may impact benefit from first-line <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> in patients with <em>RAS</em> WT tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-completed-clinical-trials/abstract/183\" class=\"abstract_t\">183</a>]. The total population with KRAS WT tumors on the left side (n = 732) or the right side (n = 293) was included in this analysis. In a preliminary report presented at the 2016 annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, overall survival was significantly higher for left-sided tumors (median 33.3 versus 19.4 months), a finding that has been noted by others, including in a retrospective analysis of the FIRE-3 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-completed-clinical-trials/abstract/229-231\" class=\"abstract_t\">229-231</a>].

Unfortunately, this meta-analysis has methodological issues that may compromise the conclusions. The data extraction was not described, and there was no mention of the quality of the follow-up in any of the trials. Furthermore, only 1011 of the 2014 patients included in all three trials were included in the analysis (largely because of the absence of <em>KRAS</em> evaluation in the CALGB and FIRE-3 trials), and there was no analysis performed to compare patients included and excluded in the analysis; these issues introduce the possibility of substantial bias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A similar relationship between location of the primary tumor and benefit from anti-EGFR agents has been reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-completed-clinical-trials/abstract/186,205,234\" class=\"abstract_t\">186,205,234</a>].

Historically, mCRC was considered non-immunogenic, that is, incapable of inducing immune-mediated tumor destruction. However, the importance of the immune system in the biology of CRC is underscored by the finding that infiltration of the tumor by specific T cell immune infiltrates is highly correlated with better disease-free and overall survival at all tumor stages. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer#H1319388909\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and prognostic determinants of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Host immune response'</a>.)</p><p>These data suggest that an immune response to specific tumor antigens might drive improved outcomes. However, most tumor-associated antigens in CRC, while expressed at higher levels within tumor, are also expressed in other tissues. As a result, the tolerance mechanisms that suppress the immune response to self-antigens to minimize autoimmune disease may also serve to suppress the immune response to these tumor antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-completed-clinical-trials/abstract/255\" class=\"abstract_t\">255</a>]. Based upon data on the immunogenicity of mutated antigens in melanoma, it has been hypothesized that &quot;neoantigens&quot; generated from tumor-specific mutations of self-antigens within CRC may be recognized by the immune system as foreign and could therefore trigger an antitumor immune response.

These include tumor recognition, presentation of tumor antigen to T cells, T cell activation, and direct attack of tumor. Several immune checkpoints exist to dampen the immune response in order to protect against detrimental inflammation and autoimmunity. In the setting of malignancy, such immune checkpoints can lead to immune tolerance of the tumor and subsequent progression of malignancy. One well-characterized checkpoint being targeted in several tumor types, including mCRC, is the programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1). PD-1 is upregulated on activated T cells, and upon recognition of tumor via the T cell receptor, PD-1 engagement by programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) can lead to T cell inactivation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90346 \">figure 1</a>).
