Early identification of patients with RA and, in particular, of those likely to assume a more rapidly destructive form of disease is important because of the possible benefit from early, aggressive intervention with disease-modifying agents. This realization has prompted the investigation and measurement of numerous biologic &quot;markers&quot; in blood and joint fluids that may serve as indicators of prognosis and the response to therapy. Although some of the markers under consideration are accessible in routine practice, many are in the stage of experimental evaluation and require access to specialized technology and customized reagents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICALLY USEFUL MARKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the many biologic markers that have been assessed for usefulness in estimating disease activity and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), only a few have found a role in clinical practice. The main clinically useful biologic markers in patients with RA include rheumatoid factors (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). These tests and their clinical use in diagnosis and assessment of disease outcome are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Commercially available assays for the detection of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), including antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP), are widely used clinically in the evaluation of RA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biologic markers in the diagnosis and assessment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies'</a>.)</p><p>Antikeratin antibodies (AKA) were originally identified in 1979 in patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A related antibody, antiperinuclear factor antibody (APF), is also associated with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Study of APF and AKA led to the appreciation that both types of antibodies recognize epidermal filaggrin, an intermediate filament-associated protein involved in cornification of the epidermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A major determinant of antibody binding to filaggrin is the presence of citrulline, formed by a post-translational modification of arginine. Citrullination is catalyzed by peptidylarginine deiminase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Antibodies against this antigen had higher specificity for RA than did rheumatoid factor (RF). However, assays for these antibodies were technically demanding and never widely available.</p><p>Identification of these and other post-translationally modified peptides and proteins containing the amino acid citrulline led to the development of the more convenient and standardized assays for antibodies to citrullinated proteins, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for anti-CCP antibodies.

All patients with detectable AKA developed at least some erosions by the end of the eight-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. One cohort with recent-onset RA was followed by the same investigators; the initial presence of AKA was associated with active and treatment-resistant disease at up to three years but did not predict radiologic progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Others have reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, among patients with chronic erosive RA, APF and AKA do not define any subgroup with a particularly aggressive course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar to RF, the presence of AKA, APF, or antifilaggrin antibodies may antedate clinical RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. In addition, detection of either AKA or APF in a healthy individual with a positive sensitized sheep red blood cell agglutination test further increases the relative risk of developing RF-positive RA by a factor of five [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, a significant number of antibody-positive patients do not develop disease. As an example, in the study just quoted, 12 of 70 RF positive patients who did not develop RA tested positive for either AKA, APF, or both antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A negative AKA may help exclude a diagnosis of RA in patients who are RF-positive and present with symptoms suggestive of RA but who have other disorders.

Antibodies to mutated citrullinated vimentin (anti-MCV) may be associated with more severe disease than anti-CCP antibodies and may be comparable to anti-CCP in predicting radiographic progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28</a>]. A commercial assay for antibodies to MCV is available, and the information below is presented for historical perspective.

Anti-Sa antibodies were much less sensitive (44 versus 72 percent) with a similar specificity (96 versus 94 percent). Anti-Sa and anti-CCP antibodies were discordant in 47 of 87 patients with RA. Thus, assays for anti-Sa antibodies were proposed as being useful when anti-CCP antibodies are negative but RA is still suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28680483\"><span class=\"h4\">Other autoantibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other autoantibodies have also been the subject of investigation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-p68 (BiP) antibodies &ndash; A protein that serves as a chaperone in the endoplasmic reticulum and binds to immunoglobulin heavy chains is a p68 autoantigen named BiP.

Furthermore, it has been postulated that anti-RA33 antibodies are an early and stable marker of RA, since all seven patients in the Austrian study who had initially unclassified anti-RA33 positive arthritis went on to develop RA within three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-biologic-markers-in-the-diagnosis-and-assessment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].
