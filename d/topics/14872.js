However, many children complete schooling without achieving more than basic literacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pediatric clinicians are well positioned to identify children at risk for reading difficulties and children who have unexpected difficulties in learning to read. Early identification and timely intervention for such children improve long-term outcome.</p><p>Interventions for children with reading difficulty in children will be discussed here.

Different terms may be used in different settings and by different groups (eg, educators, health care providers). Definitions for the terms that are used in this topic review are provided below. A detailed discussion of terminology is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reading difficulty in children: Normal reading development and etiology of reading difficulty&quot;, section on 'Terminology and conceptual framework'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Reading difficulty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Reading difficulty&quot; is defined from a normative perspective (ie, how a child performs in reading compared with peers or educational expectations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Reading difficulty has a number of causes, one of which is reading disability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Reading disability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reading disability is best defined as &quot;an unexpected difficulty in learning how to read despite adequate intelligence, instruction, and motivation&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The terms &quot;dyslexia,&quot; &quot;developmental dyslexia,&quot; &quot;specific reading disability,&quot; and &quot;reading disorder&quot; also are used to describe this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], although a more specific definition for &quot;dyslexia&quot; is provided below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Dyslexia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;dyslexia&quot; is used as a synonym for specific reading disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The International Dyslexia Association defines dyslexia as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]:</p><p>&quot;Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neurological in origin. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonologic component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede the growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.&quot;</p><p>This definition also has been adopted by the United States National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development. In the text that follows, &quot;reading disability&quot; is used synonymously with &quot;dyslexia.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with reading disability may require lifelong assistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The optimal management strategy depends upon the individual's age and circumstances. Strategies for preschool children focus on early literacy promotion. Strategies for children who are learning to read but who are slightly behind compared with classmates focus on remediation of the underlying problems in phonologic processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Strategies for children who are learning to read but who are significantly behind classmates or who have disordered patterns in acquisition of reading skills focus on both remediation and compensation (usually through special education interventions). Strategies for children who have begun to read focus on increasing sight word vocabulary and reading comprehension. Strategies for children in secondary school and beyond focus on accommodation.</p><p>Effective intervention programs provide children with systematic instruction in five critical areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phonemic awareness &ndash; The ability to focus on and manipulate phonemes (the smallest units of spoken language) in spoken words</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phonics &ndash; Knowledge of relationships between letters and sounds and spelling-sound correspondence, which allows fluent phonologic decoding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluency &ndash; The ability to read orally with accuracy, speed, and expression</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vocabulary &ndash; The storage of word meanings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comprehension &ndash; The ability to think about and extract the information provided in text while reading (ability to construct meaning from the recognized words) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p/><p>In addition to systematic and structured training exercises in phonemic awareness and phonics, children with reading difficulty require practice in reading stories aloud [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Reading practice allows children with reading disability to use their decoding skills while reading words in context and to experience reading for meaning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reading-difficulty-in-children-normal-reading-development-and-etiology-of-reading-difficulty#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reading difficulty in children: Normal reading development and etiology of reading difficulty&quot;, section on 'Normal reading development'</a>.)</p><p>The evaluation of interventions for reading difficulty has occurred primarily in children beginning to read (eg, in kindergarten and first grade). Phonemic awareness and phonics instruction have been evaluated in a number of randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Interventions for older children are not well studied, and there are no firm conclusions regarding the best way to teach fluency, vocabulary, and reading comprehension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Management of reading disability may involve educators, psychologists, and pediatric clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Interventions usually are provided by educators within the school system <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or,</span> depending upon family resources, by private tutors.

Nearly all code-based interventions emphasize phonologic awareness, either in isolation or in combination with other code-focused instruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Language enhancement &ndash; Language-enhancement interventions are instructional efforts aimed at improving language development in young children. Such interventions enhance a wide range of measures of oral language, including expressive and receptive language skills, phonemic awareness, and verbal intelligence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shared reading &ndash; Shared-reading interventions involve reading one-on-one to children with varying degrees of child-reader interaction.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that regular literacy promotion begin during infancy and continue until entry into school and supports the regular provision of books at well-child visits for vulnerable populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>No existing research has evaluated the effect of ROR on early reading skills (eg, print knowledge, phonologic awareness) or beyond entry into kindergarten [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, randomized, quasi-experimental, and observational studies indicate that ROR affects parents' reading frequency, behaviors, and attitudes and improves language development in young, high-risk children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/16,18-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-25</a>].

Intensive instruction can consist of three to five sessions weekly, lasting 30 to 60 minutes each, occurring in a small group setting (ie, three students or less), and provided over the course of several weeks to a year. More severely disabled readers may need intensive instruction over the course of years. The intensity of instruction can be increased by increasing the number of sessions per week, increasing the duration of the sessions, and by reducing the number of sound-symbol correspondences that are taught each week. Low-intensity supplemental tutoring for a few minutes two or three times per week, or instruction provided in groups of 6 to 10, are not likely to result in an adequate response and may not be cost effective in the long run [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reading-difficulty-in-children-interventions/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Intervention programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Orton-Gillingham approach to reading intervention has been used since the 1930s.

Strategies for preschool children focus on early literacy promotion. Strategies for children who are learning to read but are slightly behind compared with classmates focus on remediation. Strategies for children who are learning to read but who are significantly behind classmates or who have disordered patterns in acquisition of reading skills focus on both remediation and compensation (usually through special education interventions). Strategies for children who have begun to read focus on increasing sight word vocabulary and reading comprehension. Strategies for children in secondary school and beyond focus on accommodation.
