It may or may not be preceded by preterm labor. Seventy to eighty percent of preterm births (PTBs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113391 \">table 1</a>) are spontaneous: due to preterm labor (40 to 50 percent) or preterm premature rupture of membranes (20 to 30 percent); rarely cervical insufficiency results in spontaneous preterm birth. The remaining 20 to 30 percent of PTBS are iatrogenic: due to maternal or fetal issues that jeopardize the health of the mother or fetus (eg, preeclampsia, placenta previa, abruptio placenta, fetal growth restriction, multiple gestation). Complications of pregnancy can lead to both spontaneous and provider-initiated preterm births.</p><p>There are many risk factors for PTB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68992 \">table 2</a>) and many pathways from these risk factors to the terminal cascade of events resulting in labor. Preterm labor likely occurs when local uterine factors prematurely stimulate this cascade or suppressive factors that inhibit the cascade and maintain uterine quiescence are withdrawn prematurely. The four major factors leading to preterm labor are intrauterine infection, decidual hemorrhage, excessive uterine stretch, and maternal or fetal stress. Uteroplacental vascular insufficiency, exaggerated inflammatory response, hormonal factors, cervical insufficiency, and genetic predisposition also play a role. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spontaneous preterm birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ideally, identification of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors for PTB before conception or early in pregnancy will lead to interventions that help prevent this complication. However, few interventions have been proven to prolong pregnancy in women at risk. This goal has been elusive for several reasons: two-thirds of PTBs occur among women with no risk factors, causality has been difficult to prove (eg, a cofactor may be required thus complicating the chain of causality), and no adequate animal model exists for study of spontaneous PTB (sPTB).</p><p>Risk factors for PTB and potential interventions to mitigate risk, when possible, will be reviewed here. Pathogenesis of PTB and diagnosis and treatment of preterm labor are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spontaneous preterm birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhibition-of-acute-preterm-labor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhibition of acute preterm labor&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-preterm-labor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of preterm labor&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REPRODUCTIVE HISTORY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">History of spontaneous preterm birth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of sPTB is the major risk factor for recurrence, and recurrences often occur at the same gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Women at highest risk are those with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No term pregnancy between the previous sPTB and the current pregnancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of multiple sPTBs</p><p/><p>In large series, the frequency of recurrent sPTB was 15 to 30 percent after one sPTB and increased after two sPTBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. The odds of recurrent sPTB in three high income countries (New Zealand, Sweden, Slovenia) ranged from 4.5 to 7.1, in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In a large prospective series, approximately 5 percent of women who had an early sPTB at 23 to 27 weeks in their prior pregnancy delivered at &lt;28 weeks in their subsequent pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. By comparison, if there was no previous history of sPTB, then the risk of sPTB &lt;28 weeks was only 0.2 percent.</p><p>Other characteristics of the prior sPTB may also predict recurrence risk. In a small retrospective cohort study, women who presented with painless advanced cervical dilation were significantly more&nbsp;likely to have recurrent sPTB than women with a history of PPROM or PTL (55 versus 27 versus 32 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1613249247\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> below.).</p><p>A prior sPTB of twins, especially if before 34 weeks, is associated with an increased risk of sPTB in a subsequent singleton pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The overall risk of sPTB in twin pregnancy is significantly higher in multiparous women whose previous singleton pregnancy was a sPTB: 67.3 percent versus 20.9 percent if the previous singleton delivery was at term (odds ratio 7.8, 95% CI 5.5-11.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1570148936\"><span class=\"h3\">Intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progesterone supplementation reduces the risk of PTB by approximately 30 percent in women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of spontaneous PTB.

The March of Dimes encourages women to space pregnancies at least 18 months apart. (See <a href=\"#H3098818486\" class=\"local\">'Short interpregnancy interval'</a> below.)</p><p>Although an increase in uterine activity is a prerequisite for labor, randomized trials and a meta-analysis have shown that self-measurement of the frequency of uterine contractions by <span class=\"nowrap\">self-palpation/detection</span> of signs of labor or through use of a home uterine activity monitor does not lead to a reduction in the rate of PTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Moreover, such an approach increases the frequency of unscheduled antenatal visits. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends not using home uterine activity monitoring as a screening strategy for prediction or prevention of PTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Prophylactic tocolytic therapy for prevention of PTB in high-risk asymptomatic women is not effective, although few randomized trials have been conducted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

The rate of recurrent PTB was 23 percent for women with a prior indicated PTB and 31.6 percent for women with a prior sPTB. Women with a prior indicated PTB were at particularly high risk for recurrent indicated PTB (relative risk [RR] 9.10, 95% CI 4.68-17.71) but also at increased risk of sPTB (RR 2.70, 95% CI 2.00-3.65). Women with a prior sPTB were at five- to sixfold increased risk for recurrent sPTB, but also appeared to be at slightly increased risk for indicated PTB (RR 1.61, 95% CI 0.98-2.67).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H853071459\"><span class=\"h3\">Intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interventions to reduce the risk for recurrent indicated PTB depend on the indication for PTB. For example, administration of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> to women with a history of early delivery because of preeclampsia with severe features can reduce their risk for recurrent preeclampsia and PTB (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-prevention#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Prevention&quot;, section on 'Low-dose aspirin'</a>). A secondary analysis of data from trials of aspirin for prevention of preeclampsia in high risk women found that aspirin might reduce the risk of spontaneous PTB as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History of abortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a 2015 systematic review of pregnancy outcome after uterine evacuation including over one million women (31 studies involving termination of pregnancy, five studies involving spontaneous abortion), women with a history of surgical uterine evacuation had a small but statistical increase in risk for PTB in a subsequent pregnancy compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preterm-birth-risk-factors-and-interventions-for-risk-reduction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Women who underwent medical termination of pregnancy had a similar future risk of PTB as women with no history of pregnancy termination. Although surgical uterine evacuation appeared to be a risk factor for subsequent PTB, observational studies are flawed because they are subject to recall bias and inadequate adjustment of many of the other risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome.
