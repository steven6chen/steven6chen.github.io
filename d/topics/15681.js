Some people with diabetes use an insulin pump instead of insulin shots as a way to get their insulin treatment.</p><p>An insulin pump is about the size of a cell phone. People wear or carry their pump on their body all the time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130048\"><span class=\"h1\">How does an insulin pump work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An insulin pump delivers insulin through a thin tube that goes under the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F84008\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef84008 \">figure 1</a>). People need to use a small needle (or a device that has a small needle) to put the tube under their skin. Then they cover the tube with a patch and leave it in place for 2 to 3 days. After this time, the tube needs to be taken out and put under the skin in a different spot.</p><p>Only short-acting (regular) insulin or rapid-acting insulins are used with a pump. If you use a pump, your doctor or nurse will help you figure out the amount of insulin that you should get continuously &ndash; all day and night. This is called a &quot;basal&quot; rate. Then, before meals, you will program your pump to give a higher dose of insulin (called a &quot;bolus&quot;). This amount will depend on what you plan to eat and what your blood sugar level is.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2480028706\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I still need to check my blood sugar every day?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Just like people who use insulin shots, people with an insulin pump need to check their blood sugar level a few times each day. This usually involves pricking a fingertip 4 or more times a day.</p><p>Some people also use a device that measures the blood sugar all the time. This is called &quot;continuous monitoring.&quot; The person wears a special sensor that attaches to the skin with a sticky patch. It measures blood sugar and sends the information to a small box that can attach to clothing or go in a bag. People who have continuous monitoring still need to check their blood sugar by pricking their skin several times a day. This is to make sure the monitoring device is working correctly.</p><p>Some insulin pumps are combined with the continuous monitoring device. Using this kind of combined system can make it easier to figure out what dose of insulin you need. Some newer systems will even adjust the dose automatically based on your blood sugar level. This is called an &quot;artificial pancreas.&quot; That's because the system does the job the pancreas (an organ in the belly) normally does, producing the amount of insulin the body needs. Depending on which system you have, you might still need to choose your bolus dose before meals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130080\"><span class=\"h1\">Who might use an insulin pump?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People of all ages can use an insulin pump. Most often, insulin pumps are used in people with type 1 diabetes. But more and more, people with type 2 diabetes are using them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130095\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits of an insulin pump?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared to insulin shots, an insulin pump has the following benefits:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It does not involve getting insulin shots every day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with an insulin pump have more choices about when and what they eat. They don't always have to plan their meals in advance. They can just give themselves a bolus dose to cover the food they plan to eat and the activities they plan to do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using an insulin pump might help people keep their blood sugar levels under better control, with fewer highs and lows.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130110\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the downsides of an insulin pump?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The downsides of an insulin pump include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It takes time to learn how to program and use an insulin pump.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the tube slips out of the skin or gets a kink in it, people won't get any insulin. Then their blood sugar level can get too high, which can lead to serious problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin pumps usually cost more than insulin shots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People sometimes gain weight when they use it, because they have more choices about what and when they can eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing or carrying an insulin pump all the time can be bothersome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The area where the tube goes into the skin can get infected.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130125\"><span class=\"h1\">How do people wear or carry their pump?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People wear or carry their pump in different ways. They can put it in their waistband, shorts, underwear, or bra. They can also keep it in their pocket or clip it to a belt.</p><p>At night, people can put their pump in their pajamas or clip it to a blanket, sheet, or pillow.</p><p>Most people can disconnect their pump and take it off for short periods of time, about 1 to 2 hours. That way, people don't need to wear it when they shower, bathe, swim, or have sex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130140\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I decide if I should switch to an insulin pump?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You, your doctor, and your family will need to discuss whether an insulin pump is right for you. To help you decide, discuss the benefits and downsides of using a pump, and your individual situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4130155\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-1-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 1 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=using-insulin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Using insulin (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-insulin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child insulin (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diabetic ketoacidosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carb-counting-for-children-with-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Carb counting for children with diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-blood-sugar-in-people-with-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low blood sugar in people with diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-1-insulin-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 1: Insulin treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-insulin-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Insulin treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-low-blood-sugar-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
