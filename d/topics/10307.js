The disorder most frequently affects elderly adults and classically presents with generalized pruritic urticarial plaques and tense subepithelial blisters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F72866%7EDERM%2F79112%7EDERM%2F78910\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72866 graphicRef79112 graphicRef78910 \">picture 1A-C</a>). </p><p>First-line therapy for bullous pemphigoid consists of topical or systemic corticosteroids; both interventions are rapidly effective for this disease. Additional immunomodulatory therapies are often added to treatment to minimize the adverse effects of chronic corticosteroid therapy or to augment improvement in the disease.</p><p>The management of bullous pemphigoid will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, potential triggers, clinical features, and diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid are discussed separately.

In addition, the implementation of skin care measures and referrals to appropriate specialists for mucosal involvement may help to manage and minimize morbidity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4033433827\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of drug-induced disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although drug-induced pemphigoid likely accounts for a small proportion of cases of bullous pemphigoid, a wide variety of drugs have been associated with the development of this disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F56085\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56085 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Therefore, a medication history should be obtained and drugs suspected of inducing bullous pemphigoid should be discontinued if feasible. Bullous pemphigoid may develop up to three months after ingestion of the inciting medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-bullous-pemphigoid-and-mucous-membrane-pemphigoid#H590419\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of bullous pemphigoid and mucous membrane pemphigoid&quot;, section on 'Infections and drugs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1140896512\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to treatment efficacy, cost, and availability, other factors influence the approach to therapy for bullous pemphigoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Since patients are often elderly and dependent upon relatives or health care workers for personal care activities, their ability to comply with treatment must be considered. As an example, topical corticosteroid therapy is not a favorable option for patients who are unable to properly apply the medication and lack access to assistance. </p><p>Because much of the morbidity and mortality related to bullous pemphigoid results from the combined effect of patient comorbidities and adverse effects of treatment, rather than from direct effects of the disease, treatment should be conservative. Elderly patients often have medical conditions that may increase risk for drug-related side effects. Thus, the minimal amount of medication required to achieve remission should be given.</p><p>Our preferred first-line therapy for patients with bullous pemphigoid is a high potency topical corticosteroid due to evidence that supports the efficacy and relative safety of this treatment. A systemic glucocorticoid is another acceptable first-line treatment option that we typically use when factors such as drug cost, drug availability, or an inability to properly administer topical treatment preclude the use of topical therapy. In addition, patient preference for systemic therapy based upon quality of life concerns may prompt the selection of systemic treatment for patients who are more likely to tolerate oral glucocorticoids well (eg, nonelderly, otherwise healthy individuals). Particularly for patients with widespread involvement, systemic therapy is faster and easier to administer than topical therapy.</p><p>Due to the chronic nature of bullous pemphigoid and the multiple adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids, adjunctive agents are often added in an attempt to reduce long-term glucocorticoid-dependence. Immunosuppressants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> are commonly prescribed. Anti-inflammatory agents, including tetracyclines administered with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicotinamide-niacinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicotinamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> may also be of benefit.</p><p>Biologic therapies may be effective for bullous pemphigoid which cannot be satisfactorily managed with the treatments above alone. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> and intravenous immunoglobulin are options for additional therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24368186\"><span class=\"h2\">General skin care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best approach to the care of blistered skin has not been definitively established. In our experience, daily rupturing of tense blisters is useful for reducing lateral extension of the blister edges. We instruct patients and caregivers to cleanse blisters with alcohol prior to rupturing them with a sterile needle. Since the overlying epithelial layer (blister roof) can act as a natural wound dressing, it should be left in place. Open erosions should be covered with non-stick dressings to reduce pain and the risk for infection.</p><p>Superinfection is a significant concern in patients with bullous pemphigoid, particularly when numerous skin lesions are present and systemic immunosuppressants are being utilized for treatment. Patients and caregivers should be informed about the warning signs of infection to facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1140896641\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of bullous pemphigoid is a multidisciplinary affair that ideally consists of management by a dermatologist in conjunction with the patient&rsquo;s primary care physician. Because mucosal surfaces can be involved, additional specialists may be added as needed. As an example, patients with signs of ocular involvement (eg, itching, burning sensations, visual changes) should be referred promptly to an ophthalmologist. Likewise, referral to a gastroenterologist or otolaryngologist should be performed for the rare patient who exhibits symptoms suggestive of esophageal, laryngeal, or pharyngeal disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24368200\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Corticosteroids, administered topically or systemically, are the cornerstone of therapy. A topical corticosteroid is our preferred first-line treatment. When the clinical scenario indicates that topical corticosteroids are not an appropriate choice, we utilize a systemic glucocorticoid as the initial treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1140896512\" class=\"local\">'Approach to pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24368207\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The topical corticosteroid selected should be a high potency agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 2</a>). We typically utilize <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> 0.05% cream.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691465063\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of topical corticosteroids as monotherapy for bullous pemphigoid (BP) is supported by a multicenter randomized trial which found that patients with extensive bullous pemphigoid who were treated with topical corticosteroids had better clinical outcomes than patients with extensive bullous pemphigoid who were treated with systemic glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The trial included 341 patients with newly diagnosed bullous pemphigoid (153 patients with moderate bullous pemphigoid [defined as &le;10 new bullae per day] and 188 patients with extensive bullous pemphigoid [defined as &gt;10 new bullae per day]). The patients were treated with either topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% cream (a total daily dose of 40 g that was given through twice-daily applications of clobetasol to the entire cutaneous surface by the patient, a caregiver, or nurse) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for moderate disease and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for severe disease). Treatment was continued in this manner until 15 days after disease control. Subsequently, clobetasol was gradually reduced over the course of 12 months. The dose of prednisone was reduced by 15 percent every three weeks until treatment was discontinued after 12 months.</p><p>The results of the trial are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>One-year survival rates were significantly higher</strong> for patients with extensive bullous pemphigoid who were treated with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> than for patients with extensive bullous pemphigoid who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (76 versus 58 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with extensive bullous pemphigoid who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> <strong>responded significantly more quickly</strong> to treatment than patients with extensive disease who were treated systemically.

Among the patients with moderate bullous pemphigoid, the differences between the topical and systemic therapy groups for one-year survival (both 69 percent), likelihood of disease control by day 21 (100 versus 95 percent, respectively), and severe complications (32 versus 38 percent, respectively) were not statistically significant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691465005\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacies of two treatment regimens with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% cream were compared in a second randomized trial of 312 patients with newly-diagnosed bullous pemphigoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A milder regimen (10 to 20 g per day for moderate disease and 20 to 30 g per day for extensive disease until 15 days after disease control, then tapered to discontinuation over four months) was as effective for attaining control of moderate and extensive bullous pemphigoid as the regimen used in the trial above (40 g per day tapered slowly over 12 months). In the trial, disease control was achieved by day 21 in 98 versus 100 percent of patients, respectively. As may have been expected, relapses were more likely to occur during the one-year trial in patients in the less aggressive treatment group (this group discontinued treatment after four months); one year disease-free survival rates were 30 versus 45 percent, respectively.</p><p>In addition, after adjustments were made for patient age and general health status (Karnofsky score), a statistically significant reduction in the risk for mortality and life-threatening adverse effects was detected among patients with moderate bullous pemphigoid who were treated with the milder regimen compared to those treated with the higher dose regimen (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30-0.97). A significant difference in these factors was not seen among patients with extensive disease (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.76-1.82). </p><p>When treating patients with topical corticosteroid therapy, we typically prescribe twice daily applications of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% cream. For patients with limited involvement, we focus on application to affected areas. For patients with widespread lesions, we instruct patients and caregivers to apply the treatment to the trunk and extremities.</p><p>After active inflammation, new blister formation, and pruritus have ceased for at least two weeks and 80 percent of existing blisters have healed, we begin to taper topical corticosteroid therapy by slowly reducing the amount of medication applied and the frequency of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Tapering is continued as tolerated, and typically lasts four months or longer. </p><p>The cost of topical corticosteroids (generally higher than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) and limited access to these agents may inhibit the use of topical corticosteroids in some clinical settings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1140896757\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High potency topical corticosteroids can result in cutaneous atrophy, striae, and folliculitis. Adrenal suppression is an additional concern with the extensive application of topical corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Among a subset of 28 patients evaluated for adrenal suppression in the dose-comparison trial above, only 5 of 18 patients in the mild regimen group (28 percent) and 1 of 8 patients in the higher dose regimen group (12 percent) had positive cosyntropin tests (an indicator of adrenal sufficiency) after seven days of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In the trial, 95 and 91 percent of patients with moderate or extensive bullous pemphigoid, respectively, who were treated with a systemic glucocorticoid achieved disease control by 21 days.

A similar but lesser effect was observed for BP230 antibodies.</p><p>BP is a potentially fatal disease. Estimates for one-year overall mortality of patients with BP have ranged from 11 to 48 percent, with most studies finding increased rates of mortality compared subjects without BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-bullous-pemphigoid/abstract/78-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-82</a>].

Multiple immunomodulatory therapies are utilized for the management of this disease. (See <a href=\"#H24368172\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24368179\" class=\"local\">'Approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with bullous pemphigoid we recommend treatment with a high-potency topical corticosteroid such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> 0.05% cream (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). If topical corticosteroid therapy is not practical or feasible due to patient-specific characteristics or preferences, we recommend treatment with a systemic glucocorticoid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H24368200\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because bullous pemphigoid often persists for years, an immunosuppressive glucocorticoid-sparing agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, is often added to reduce the risk for glucocorticoid side effects. Tetracyclines and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> are additional options. Data to confirm the value of glucocorticoid-sparing agents in BP are lacking. (See <a href=\"#H24368221\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid-sparing agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who require systemic treatment, but in whom systemic glucocorticoid therapy cannot be utilized (due to comorbidities or other factors), a glucocorticoid sparing agent may be utilized as the primary therapy. We typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H24368221\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoid-sparing agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biologic therapy may be useful for the management of patients who fail to respond to topical corticosteroids, systemic glucocorticoids, and glucocorticoid-sparing agents. For these patients, we suggest treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H691465200\" class=\"local\">'Refractory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course of bullous pemphigoid is variable. In addition to the clinical assessment, the measurement of serum levels of BP180 antibodies is useful for following the response to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1483971202\" class=\"local\">'Assessing response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remission may occur after months or years. Bullous pemphigoid is a potentially fatal disease.
