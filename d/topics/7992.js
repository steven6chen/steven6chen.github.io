Children who complain of headache usually are brought to medical attention by their parents due to missing school or social activity or concerns of an ominous etiology such as a brain tumor or an untreatable cause. The first step in evaluation is a thorough history, physical, and neurologic examination. If these are abnormal or suspicious for a secondary etiology, additional diagnostic testing is performed.</p><p>An overview of the causes, evaluation, and management of headache in children will be presented here.

In a population-based study, 1.5 percent of middle school students (age 12 to 14 years) had &quot;chronic daily headache&quot; (15 headache days per month with chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headaches making up the majority, and chronic migraine most frequently presenting for evaluation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-children-approach-to-evaluation-and-general-management-strategies/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

It is characterized by recurrent episodes of head pain that is typically moderate to severe in intensity, lasting 2 to 72 hours if not treated, characterized by focal pain that is throbbing and worsens with activity or reduced activity. It can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity, and sound sensitivity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50876 \">table 2A</a>). In children, particularly young children, the duration of headache is typically shorter than in adults, lengthening with age. Migraines in children are more often bilateral (bifrontal or bitemporal). Headaches that are occipital in location have an increased risk of a secondary cause (although migraine remains the most common cause of occipital headaches) and need to be investigated further.

It is defined as headaches on 15 or more days per month with at least eight having migraine features. Chronic migraine is a considerable problem in children. In a population-based study of middle school students (age 12 to 14 years), the overall prevalence was 1.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-children-approach-to-evaluation-and-general-management-strategies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Motion sickness precipitated by reading in a car is a common feature in migraine sufferers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-children-approach-to-evaluation-and-general-management-strategies/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>A diary in which the quality, location, severity, timing, precipitating and palliating factors, and associated features of the headache are recorded prospectively may be a useful adjunct if the child is willing and able to complete on a daily basis. A diary is not subject to recall error, may reveal a pattern that is typical for a certain type of headache, and provides important diagnostic information for children who are unwilling or unable to provide sufficient detail during the office interview [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-children-approach-to-evaluation-and-general-management-strategies/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1170681233\"><span class=\"h3\">Headache pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining if a headache is new or represents a recurrent problem is useful in differentiating primary from secondary headaches. Most primary headaches are episodic headaches that may transform to more frequent headaches (chronification). Asking about all headaches, not just the one that is being brought to attention, can help identify this pattern.

Headaches features and frequency may vary with time, so the full history must be utilized to guide neuroimaging decision making. Neuroimaging also is usually not indicated for children with migraine who lack neurologic abnormalities. However, it may be difficult to differentiate early migraine episodes from headache secondary to a space-occupying lesion because the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria for migraine will not have been met, as five headache episodes are required (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50876 \">table 2A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-children-approach-to-evaluation-and-general-management-strategies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The yield of neuroimaging in detecting clinically significant intracranial abnormalities in children without neurologic abnormalities is extremely low.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache in children and adolescents may be due to a primary headache disorder (ie, migraine, tension-type headache, trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70794\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70794 \">table 1</a>)) or secondary to an underlying medical condition. Secondary headaches usually are related to fever or infection (eg, upper respiratory infection, influenza) but may be due to central nervous system infection or space-occupying lesion. (See <a href=\"#H661157729\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of headache in children includes a thorough history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71717\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71717 \">table 3</a>), physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59967\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59967 \">table 4</a>), and neurologic examination, with particular emphasis on clinical features suggestive of intracranial pathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F79664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79664 \">table 5</a>). The headache pattern helps to determine the etiology. (See <a href=\"#H358186556\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroimaging should be performed in children with headache and neurologic signs or symptoms suggestive of intracranial pathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F79664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79664 \">table 5</a>). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually preferred. Head computed tomography (CT) is performed if MRI is not available or imaging is needed immediately (eg, suspected acute hemorrhage, rapid diagnosis of space-occupying lesion). MRI with gadolinium or CT with contrast should be performed if the clinician suspects an inflammatory cause or breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (eg, abscess, tumor). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine laboratory evaluation usually is not necessary for children with recurrent or chronic headaches. The laboratory evaluation for secondary headache should be tailored to evaluate conditions suggested by information from the history and examination. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of primary headache disorders is made clinically, based upon the criteria of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50876%7ENEURO%2F79672%7ENEURO%2F80843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50876 graphicRef79672 graphicRef80843 \">table 2A-C</a>). The diagnosis of chronic headache also is made clinically (headache on &gt;15 days per month for &gt;3 months in the absence of detectable organic pathology). The diagnosis of secondary headaches depends upon identification of the underlying condition. (See <a href=\"#H1170682877\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of recurrent and chronic headaches requires a systematic approach over several months through which the child returns to normal activities of daily living. It is critical to address excessive school absence and overuse of over-the-counter analgesic medications. (See <a href=\"#H661158522\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/headache-in-children-approach-to-evaluation-and-general-management-strategies/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Barea LM, Tannhauser M, Rotta NT.
