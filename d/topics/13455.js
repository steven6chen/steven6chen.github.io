The catheter exit site, tunnel, and peritoneum are prone to bacterial infection, which can cause morbidity and result in catheter removal.</p><p>This topic reviews the prevention, evaluation, and treatment of catheter-related infections including exit-site infections (ESIs) with or without tunnel infections. The microbiology and treatment of peritonitis and diagnosis of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-therapy-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and therapy of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fungal-peritonitis-in-continuous-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fungal peritonitis in continuous peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-peritonitis-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12690226\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The catheter and exit site become colonized with bacteria soon after catheter placement. Bacteria secrete a biofilm, which encourages further bacterial growth and protects the colonizing organisms from antibodies, white blood cells, and antimicrobial agents.</p><p>Colonization predisposes to infection, which occurs following mild exit-site trauma. The infection may involve the exit site alone or the exit site and tunnel in which the catheter resides. A tunnel infection usually occurs only in the presence of an exit-site infection (ESI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Most exit site with or without tunnel infections are caused by gram-positive bacteria, usually <em>Staphylococcus</em> species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. Gram-negative organisms (<em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Escherichia coli</em>) cause the majority of the remainder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2401242325\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exit-site infections (ESIs) have decreased since clinicians started using antimicrobial prophylaxis and other preventive measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/2,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8-10</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below). Since daily topical antibiotic cream for infection prophylaxis became the standard of care, the reported rate of ESIs is approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">12/100</span> patient-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The causative agents have also changed with routine antibiotic prophylaxis. Although most infections are still caused by gram-positive organisms, the percentage caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> appears to have decreased with increases in other gram-positive organisms and gram-negative organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. In one study in which prophylactic topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> was used at the exit site, ESI was caused by <em>S. aureus</em> in 33 percent, other gram-positive organisms in 27 percent, and gram-negative organisms in 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A sterile culture was obtained in 13 percent.</p><p>In addition, several studies have reported infection caused by uncommon organisms such as atypical mycobacteria and non-diphtheria corynebacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>The relative proportion of fungal infections has increased with prophylactic antibiotics, although the frequency has not, which reflects the decrease in bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>].

The following measures are largely consistent with the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) published guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4035905496\"><span class=\"h2\">Prior to catheter placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We administer systemic antibiotics immediately prior to surgery. Although the 2017 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and ISPD guidelines recommend screening and treating patients for <em>S. aureus</em> nasal carriage prior to peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion, we do not do this, because compliance is difficult and because routine exit-site care includes the application of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a> cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>].

In a 2010 systematic review of 14 studies enrolling 1233 patients, the topical agent, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a>, was associated with a lower risk of ESI (relative risk [RR] 0.57, 95% CI 0.46-0.66) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>We suggest daily application since this was used in most of the trials that showed benefit and since less frequent use may be less effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] or associated with antimicrobial resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].</p><p>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a> are commonly used. We use 0.1% topical gentamicin sulfate rather than mupirocin. Although initial studies used mupirocin, we believe topical gentamicin is as effective as mupirocin against <em>S. aureus</em> and may be more effective against gram-negative organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peritoneal-catheter-exit-site-and-tunnel-infections-in-peritoneal-dialysis-in-adults/abstract/6,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,31-33</a>].

The use of gentamicin was associated with a lower rate of gram-negative ESIs (RR = 2.125 compared with mupirocin), but the risk of gram-positive infection was similar in both groups.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gentamicin</a> is also generally less expensive than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a>.
