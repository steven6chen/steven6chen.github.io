As a result, clinicians must be aware of the interactions between various drugs and thyroid function, including measurements of serum thyroid hormones and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).</p><p>Issues relating to the major drug-induced or drug-related abnormalities in thyroid hormone secretion, transport, and metabolism will be reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50439\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50439 \">table 1</a>). Many of these interactions are discussed in detail separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROID HORMONE METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before discussing the different drug interactions with thyroid hormones, it is helpful to review briefly thyroid hormone metabolism and the pathways that may be affected by the administration of drugs.</p><p>Thyroidal synthesis and secretion of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are dependent on thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76931 \">figure 1</a>). Under the influence of TSH, thyroid follicular cells sequentially perform the following functions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transport of iodide from serum into the cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxidation of iodide and iodination of tyrosine residues</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synthesis of T4 and T3</p><p/><p>The latter two steps occur within thyroglobulin at the interface between the follicular cells and the lumen of the thyroid follicles. The thyroglobulin subsequently reenters the cell and is hydrolyzed to its constituent amino acids, including the thyroid hormones. The hormones are then secreted into the circulation, where they are tightly bound to serum binding proteins, mostly thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) but also transthyretin and albumin. Most of the secreted hormone is T4; by comparison, serum T3 is mainly produced by deiodination of T4 in extrathyroidal tissues.</p><p>The principal pathway of thyroid hormone metabolism is progressive deiodination to inert metabolites. However, 20 percent of thyroid hormones are conjugated either with glucuronide or sulfate and excreted into the bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the gut, some of these conjugates are hydrolyzed by bacterial enzymes and the freed hormones are then reabsorbed into the circulation.</p><p>The thyroid gland requires TSH for synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones. In normal subjects, the serum concentrations of thyroid hormones and TSH are intimately related by a delicate negative feedback system by which serum thyroid hormones inhibit TSH secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75399\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75399 \">figure 2</a>). In the absence of hypothalamic or pituitary disease, the serum TSH concentration is the most valuable guide to the assessment of thyroid function and the most sensitive index of thyroid hormone action. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Drugs can affect any aspect of the thyroid hormone system, including TSH secretion, thyroidal production of T4 and T3, their transport in serum, and their metabolism. The result may be either overt thyroid dysfunction or biochemical abnormalities that do not result in clinically important thyroid dysfunction but may be misinterpreted as indicating its presence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid function in nonthyroidal illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUGS THAT AFFECT TSH SECRETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several drugs inhibit thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion.

The effect of iodide administration in patients with abnormal thyroid glands differs from that in normal subjects and depends upon the underlying disease process (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-induced-thyroid-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction&quot;</a>). As an example, iodide administration may result in hyperthyroidism in patients with endemic goiter and iodine deficiency and, in areas of iodide sufficiency, in euthyroid patients with nodular goiters containing autonomous nodules. These nodules probably function autonomously (independent of thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]); however, they do not secrete excessive amounts of thyroid hormones in the absence of exposure to high concentrations of iodide.</p><p>Administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> and radiocontrast agents is a common cause of hyperthyroidism.

In one report, 12.1 percent of amiodarone-treated patients in an iodine-sufficient area became hyperthyroid after a mean duration of therapy of 21 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Patients with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism who have an underlying thyroid adenoma or toxic nodular goiter can be treated with a thionamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, this approach is ineffective in patients with thyroiditis, who respond best to glucocorticoid therapy. In one report, as an example, 12 patients with amiodarone-induced thyroiditis (eight of whom had failed to respond to thionamides) were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (initial dose 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Normal serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations were achieved after an average of eight days. Four patients relapsed as the prednisone dose was tapered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-and-thyroid-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone and thyroid dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lithium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although better known as a cause of hypothyroidism, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> has been associated with hyperthyroidism.

In a trial evaluating alemtuzumab versus interferon&ndash;beta-1a in patients with multiple sclerosis, thyroid dysfunction occurred more frequently in patients taking alemtuzumab (34 versus 6.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Among patients with alemtuzumab-related thyroid dysfunction, Graves' hyperthyroidism occurred most commonly (22 percent), followed by hypothyroidism and subacute thyroiditis (7 and 4 percent, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUGS THAT CAUSE HYPOTHYROIDISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several drugs can cause hypothyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F50439\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50439 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Iodine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High doses of iodine can cause hypothyroidism. Normal thyroid follicular cells have several autoregulatory functions that protect against a sudden increase in iodide availability. Upon exposure to high concentrations of iodide, thyroid cells decrease the oxidation of iodide and thyroid hormone formation (the Wolff-Chaikoff effect) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The efficiency of iodine transport decreases over a few weeks, thereby restoring the intrathyroidal iodide pool and thyroid hormone production toward normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iodine-induced-thyroid-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, in normal subjects, exposure to high serum iodide concentrations causes only a small and transient decrease in serum thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations. However, in euthyroid patients who have Hashimoto's disease, have previously been treated with radioactive iodine, or have had thyroid surgery, escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect is impaired, and therefore, they may become hypothyroid when given high doses of iodide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Similar considerations apply to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>. In one report, as an example, hypothyroidism developed in 6.9 percent of patients treated with amiodarone for a mean of 21 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This complication primarily occurred in patients with preexisting thyroid disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Lithium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> may cause hypothyroidism. A serum lithium concentration in the therapeutic range results in an increase in thyroid size in approximately 50 percent of patients and causes mild hypothyroidism in approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Some of the patients with hypothyroidism have antithyroid antibodies. If hypothyroidism develops, appropriate treatment is the administration of T4, not cessation of lithium therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-and-the-thyroid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lithium and the thyroid&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63808039\"><span class=\"h2\">Tyrosine kinase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, motesanib) used for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia, and in other cancers can cause hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Hypothyroidism may occur in patients with previously normal thyroid function and may be preceded by a destructive thyroiditis and transient suppression of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In patients with preexisting hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone requirements may increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/16,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23,24</a>]. Sorafenib treatment is associated with increased type 3 deiodination, which increases the metabolism of T4 and T3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This finding may explain, in part, the increased thyroid hormone requirements in patients taking these drugs.</p><p>Of the kinase inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> appears to cause thyroid dysfunction most frequently, with subclinical hypothyroidism reported in 30 to 80 percent of patients treated with sunitinib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It is possible that kinase inhibitors like sunitinib that broadly target tyrosine kinases, specifically vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, are more likely to cause hypothyroidism by causing capillary regression and thyroid ischemia. Other possible mechanisms include a destructive thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/22,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27</a>], impaired iodine uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], reduced thyroid peroxidase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], or decreased clearance of TSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-interactions-with-thyroid-hormones/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
