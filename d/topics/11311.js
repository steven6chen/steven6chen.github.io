It causes fever, sore throat, tiredness, and swelling of the neck glands. Some people call mono &quot;the kissing disease.&quot; That's because kissing is 1 of the ways you can catch mono. It usually affects children, teenagers, and young adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475485626\"><span class=\"h1\">How did I get mono?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The virus that causes mono lives in saliva. You can catch it from someone who has mono if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kiss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Share a fork, spoon, or knife</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink from the same glass</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475485633\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for mono?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can give you a blood test to check for mono. But even if you do have mono, the test might not show the infection during the first 2 weeks of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475485640\"><span class=\"h1\">How is mono treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no treatment that cures mono. But medicines like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) can relieve the pain and fever mono causes. If you take these medicines, be sure to follow the directions on the label.</p><p>Antibiotics do not work on mono.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475485647\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Get plenty of rest. And drink enough fluids so that your urine is pale yellow instead of dark yellow. Drinking fluids is really important if you are taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a>. That's because ibuprofen can cause problems with your kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475485654\"><span class=\"h1\">When can I go back to work or school?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can go back to school or work when you feel better. But you might need to avoid sports or other physical activities for at least a month. That's because mono can cause 1 of the organs in your body to become bigger than it should be. This organ is called the spleen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61816\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61816 \">figure 1</a>). When it is too big, it can get damaged during physical activity.</p><p>If your spleen gets big when you have mono, you will have to avoid physical activity until your doctor or nurse says you can go back to it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475485661\"><span class=\"h1\">When will I feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will probably start to feel better in 1 to 2 weeks. But it can be a month or more before you get back to normal. Most people get over mono with no lasting problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H475485668\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sore throat in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-mononucleosis-mono-in-adults-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Infectious mononucleosis (mono) in adults and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
