One- and five-year patient survival for deceased donor liver transplants has reached 86 and 72 percent, respectively, and for living donor liver transplants, 90 and 78 percent, respectively, due to advances in surgical techniques, immunosuppression, and organ preservation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While the number of liver transplants performed in the United States has reached approximately 6000 per year, the demand for donor organs far exceeds the supply. As a result, there are more than 1800 deaths per year on the liver transplant waiting list [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The relative shortage of donor organs provides the basis for many of the ethical issues associated with liver transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ORGAN DONATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The current system of organ donation in the United States is based on the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 1968 and is referred to as &quot;opting in&quot; or &quot;expressed volunteerism&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This statute authorizes competent adults to specify their preferences regarding organ donation. Procurement agencies generally exceed the provisions of the statute and ask for consent from the next of <span class=\"nowrap\">kin/legal</span> decision-maker even when there is a signed donor card or online organ donation registration, to be sure that the <span class=\"nowrap\">family/legal</span> decision-maker is in support of donation. More frequently, there is no signed donor card or other evidence of an advanced directive about organ donation. In this circumstance, the family is asked to make a judgment about the wishes of the deceased. Donation is carried out in the absence of a donor card if the next of <span class=\"nowrap\">kin/legal</span> decision-maker is in agreement. However, asking a grieving family member to make a difficult decision in a time of crisis poses a significant barrier to donation. Further efforts are underway to enhance the process of obtaining advanced directives about organ donation.</p><p>A number of states adopted a revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (1987) stipulating that the next of <span class=\"nowrap\">kin/legal</span> decision-maker need not consent to organ donation if the deceased made his or her wishes known in writing to a clinician prior to death. Many states have enacted a &quot;first person consent&quot; law making a person's wish to be an <span class=\"nowrap\">organ/tissue</span> donor legally binding. The position of the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs of the American Medical Association is consistent with this legislation. The Council stated: &quot;It is ethically preferable for the individual, rather than the family, to decide to donate organs&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A further iteration of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act proposed in 2006 contained a provision prioritizing organ donation over other end-of-life care in an effort to increase organ availability. The Act raised ethical concerns that organ donation should not trump other end-of-life management decisions such as refusal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A revised version was proposed subsequently that provides for resolution of any conflict between end-of-life care and organ donation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Efforts to increase donor organ availability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The organ donation process is relatively inefficient for a number of reasons. Organs are lost when clinicians fail to recognize criteria for brain death. Educational programs for health care providers could be helpful in clarifying the laws regarding the declaration of brain death. Requests for donation often have been handled by inexperienced personnel, a factor associated with a reduced consent rate. Regulations from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) require hospitals to report pending deaths and deaths to their local organ procurement organization. Now, only persons approved by the organ procurement organization are authorized to request organ donation from the next of <span class=\"nowrap\">kin/legal</span> decision-maker. Finally, families decline to consent to donation for reasons including lack of awareness about donation and difficulty in making a rapid decision at a time of emotional turmoil.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other systems for organ donation have been proposed:</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Mandated choice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Mandated choice&quot; is an alternative system that would require competent adults to record their preference for organ donation. According to this approach, all persons would be asked to complete a standard document, perhaps at the time of applying for a driver's license or filing a tax return. Decisions would not be subject to reversal by family members. Advantages of mandated choice include removing the burden on family members to make decisions about organ donation, while respecting individual autonomy, and ameliorating fears that organs might be harvested from non-consenting individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Presumed consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other approaches that might increase organ donation, including &quot;presumed consent&quot; (opting out) and the provision of economic incentives, are more controversial. Presumed consent permits the removal of suitable organs from the deceased unless objection was provided in writing before death or the family objects at the time of death. Presumed consent has increased rates of organ donation in some European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], but has been considered objectionable in the United States because it has the potential to interfere with autonomy and self-determination and could run counter to the cultural or religious beliefs of the deceased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H984647846\"><span class=\"h2\">Controlled donation after cardiac/circulatory death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Controlled donation after <span class=\"nowrap\">cardiac/circulator</span> death (DCD) is defined as &quot;planned withdrawal of ventilator and organ-perfusion support in the face of catastrophic illness&quot; and allows the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> family to donate when death by neurologic criteria will not be met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Institutions often have specific policies, protocols, or practice guidelines in place to assist with the DCD procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H147196182\"><span class=\"h3\">Uncontrolled donation after cardiac/circulatory death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncontrolled DCD protocols are another method to increase the donor pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Potential donors are persons with an unexpected, observed, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. After standard life support attempts by emergency medical service providers (ie, 30 min of advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]) are deemed futile, potential donors are transported to the hospital with continuing CPR and other interventions to preserve organs. Once at the hospital, the potential donor is declared dead, and further measures aimed at organ preservation (eg, normothermic extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO] or in-situ cooling) are initiated. These measures are continued until authorization for donation is given by the family. <br/></p><p>Several ethical concerns related to this approach have been raised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are invasive measures to preserve organs acceptable prior to establishing the wishes of the potential donors or their families?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will some potential donors be denied potentially life-saving, unconventional resuscitation procedures? Evidence suggests that some people with cardiac arrest treated with out-of-hospital CPR may benefit from continued CPR combined with unconventional resuscitation procedures that aim to treat the cause of the cardiac arrest while preserving neurologic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. As a result, international resuscitation guidelines now recommend treatment of the known or suspected causes of refractory cardiac arrest prior to discontinuing CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Such procedures include thrombolysis treatment during CPR, ECMO as a bridge to extracorporeal life support devices in the intensive care unit, and percutaneous coronary intervention. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will the methods used for organ preservation retroactively negate the cause of death? By reinstituting cerebral blood flow, ECMO can restore the potential donor's brain function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. To avoid this, some recommend blocking the aorta with a balloon obturator to separate the brain from the organs being perfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17</a>]. The concern is that such measures could be seen as contributing to the potential donor's death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Economic incentive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Economic incentive&quot; consists of payment for organ donation. As an example, individuals might pledge their organs against a death benefit that would be paid to surviving family members. Such payment could help to foster the belief that society is dealing fairly with families regarding organ donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, payment for organs raises a number of questions such as who would serve as the organ broker, would the precedent foster a black market trade in organs, should prospective donors receive a payment, and would vulnerable individuals be coerced into living organ donation by others? Opinion in the United States has been opposed to the commercial trade of organs that was outlawed by the National Organ Transplantation Act of 1984.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Living donor liver transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) provides a means to expand the organ supply. Donor morbidity is low with left lateral segmentectomy required for transplantation of small children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. It is generally considered reasonable for parents or other close relatives to accept a small amount of risk in an effort to save the life of the child. Many transplant centers are now performing adult LDLT in which a healthy adult donates approximately 55 to 60 percent of his or her liver to another adult with advanced liver disease. Right lobectomy engenders more risk to the donor than left lateral segmentectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>One of the main ethical questions regarding the use of living organ donors is whether it is ever justified to expose a healthy person to harm primarily for the benefit of another. A second related question is whether or not informed consent can really be secured in situations where a person is committed to give part of their liver to save the life of a loved one. The concept of equipoise also provides a basis for ethical concern regarding adult LDLT. That is, the overall benefit to the recipient must be favorable to warrant the risk to the healthy living donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Revisions to the CMS rules and regulations mandate transplant centers that perform living donor transplants to have some form of living donor advocate or advocate team for the purpose of protecting the living donor's health and safety and to ensure that principles of medical ethics and informed consent standards are applied to the practice of living donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H984647870\"><span class=\"h2\">Altruistic/stranger donors and the use of social media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most living organ donation takes place between family members or close friends; however, the number of nonrelated or stranger altruistic living organ donors has increased over the last 20 years, making up approximately 21 percent of living donors (kidney and more recently liver donors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Social media has assisted with matching a stranger donor up with a person in need of a living organ transplant. There are websites strictly for this purpose, though it remains illegal to pay a donor for an organ. The ethical issues are complex with respect to using the various social media options to seek organ donors, and the process is hard to regulate, putting vulnerable persons at risk of manipulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Prisoners</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of organs from prisoners, such as those facing the death penalty, has been suggested as another means to increase organ availability. Allowing prisoners to trade organs (eg, part of a liver) for a reduction in sentence raises a number of concerns. Living donation would put prisoners at risk for complications including mortality, potentially imposing the death penalty in some cases. Obtaining consent for organ donation from a death row prisoner with the promise of a reduced sentence could be viewed as coercive. Another theoretical concern is that jurors could be influenced to impose harsher sentences, knowing that doing so could benefit society by promoting organ donation. Furthermore, prisoners who were unable to donate an organ would face a more severe punishment than those who committed a similar crime and were able to serve as donors. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) Ethics Committee oppose any strategy regarding organ donation from condemned prisoners until all of the potential ethical concerns have been satisfactorily addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Allocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UNOS oversees organ distribution in the United States. The organ sharing system was designed in an effort to balance utility, justice, and autonomy, irrespective of race, gender, and financial or social status. The principle of utility gives preference to actions that result in the greatest aggregate good. The utilitarian perspective favors allocating livers to recipients who have the best chance of long-term graft and patient survival. Justice refers to fairness in distribution of the life-saving therapy of transplantation. The concept of justice in organ allocation can be defined in a number of ways. For example, justice can be interpreted as giving priority to patients in most immediate need, to those who have demonstrated compliance with medical care, or to individuals who will benefit society after transplantation. Autonomy allows people to make decisions about their body related to their own health care.</p><p>In the present system, organs are first directed locally within an Organ Procurement Organization boundary. Priority for transplantation within the boundaries of organ procurement organizations in the 11 UNOS regions is based upon medical urgency within a particular blood group as determined by the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The medical urgency component of the allocation process shifts organ distribution toward patients who are most in need (those most likely to die in the short-term). The system favors justice over utility because patients with a greater severity of illness, who are at increased risk for perioperative mortality, are given priority over patients who are less ill and would be expected to have superior post-transplant survival. Some authors advocate the development of a post-transplant prognostic index to further incorporate the concept of utility into the organ allocation process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>There is considerable controversy as to whether the current regionally based allocation system or a proposed national system would best serve transplant candidates.</p><p>MELD scores at the time of transplantation are higher in some geographic areas and also differ by transplant center volume. A study of one UNOS region found that transplants were performed at higher MELD scores in organ procurement organizations serving more populated areas with more than one transplant center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. An analysis of over 20,000 transplant recipients between 2002 and 2006 showed that waiting times were shorter and transplants were performed at lower MELD scores at high volume (&ge;100 transplants per year) centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a nationally based system, patients with the highest priority would receive an available organ from anywhere in the country.</p><p>There is considerable controversy as to whether the current regionally-based allocation system or a proposed national system would best serve transplant candidates. In 2012, the <span class=\"nowrap\">OPTN/UNOS</span> Board of Directors agreed that the &quot;geographic disparities in candidate access to liver transplants are unacceptably high.&quot; The board has charged the <span class=\"nowrap\">OPTN/UNOS</span> Liver and Intestinal Organ Transplantation Committee with developing a new approach for the allocation and distribution of livers for transplant that would minimize the effect of geography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSPLANTATION FOR SPECIFIC POPULATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of liver disease and the clinical setting also raise specific ethical issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol-related liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attitudes regarding transplantation for alcoholic cirrhosis have evolved as understanding of alcoholism and experience with transplanting alcoholics has increased. In the early 1990s, some authorities proposed that alcoholics should have lower priority for transplantation than patients with causes of liver disease that are not self-induced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Their premise was that alcoholics were responsible for their liver disease, or at least for failing to stop drinking once they began to develop symptoms, and should be held accountable for their self-destructive behavior. Furthermore, transplantation of alcoholics would cause a public backlash that could reduce organ donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>More recently, alcoholism has been viewed as a disease state with physical and psychosocial components as opposed to a moral weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Twin studies showing a higher concordance of alcoholism in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins, and the higher incidence of alcoholism observed in adopted children with alcoholic birth parents, support a biological basis for alcohol abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Application of the principle of justice in organ allocation to patients with alcoholic liver disease suggests that alcoholics should be given similar consideration for transplantation as patients with other medical illnesses. The principle of utility implies that alcoholic patients should have similar transplant outcomes to other recipients if they are to be considered equally.</p><p>Survival data from large transplant centers show that post-transplant survival of patients with alcoholic liver disease is comparable to that of patients transplanted for other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In one report, for example, one- and two-year survival rates were similar in patients transplanted for alcoholic liver disease versus other causes (78 and 73 versus 70 and 65 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In another series, a 60 percent seven-year post-transplant survival rate observed in patients transplanted for alcoholic liver disease was similar to or better than that reported for other diseases, including primary biliary cirrhosis (76 percent), hepatitis C (57 percent), hepatitis B (49 percent), and hepatocellular carcinoma (27 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-alcoholic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>). A case-control study showed that resource utilization, as well as outcomes, was equivalent between patients transplanted for alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Alcohol recidivism is the primary factor that jeopardizes transplant outcomes in alcoholic patients. Recidivism puts recipients at risk for recurrent alcohol-related liver disease and for allograft rejection due to noncompliance with medications. Studies evaluating recidivism after transplantation have used different means to identify patients who have returned to drinking and different definitions of recurrent alcohol use (any drinking versus return to destructive drinking). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using phone surveys, an early study of 52 transplanted alcoholics showed that only 11.5 percent consumed alcohol after transplant compared with 20.4 percent of non-alcoholic transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Neither group reported excessive alcohol consumption. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More recently a recidivism rate of 32 percent, defined as <strong>any</strong> drinking following transplantation, was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, this did not translate to a significant difference between relapsers and non-relapsers with regard to acute or chronic rejection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study showed that 13 percent of patients transplanted for alcoholic liver disease exhibited increasing patterns of moderate to heavy drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p>Most transplant programs now follow an integrated approach designed to minimize the risk of recidivism. Thorough psychosocial and chemical dependency assessments are included in the transplant evaluation process and often continue post-transplant if needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Patients with a history of alcohol abuse are enrolled in an alcohol treatment program and may be required to submit to random alcohol testing while awaiting transplantation. Criteria including a defined period of abstinence (often six months), stable social support for the patient, and absence of other substance abuse and psychiatric disability predict continued abstinence after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Liver transplantation for patients with past alcohol abuse who are judged to have a low risk of recidivism has become accepted practice based on the good long-term outcomes that have been achieved. Contrary to initial concerns, transplanting alcoholics has not adversely affected organ donation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Convicted criminals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United Network for Organ Sharing Ethics Committee Position Statement regarding transplant evaluation for convicted criminals states that because the allocation system is based upon the principles of equity and medical utility, prisoners should not be precluded from consideration for transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Excluding patients on the basis of criminal conviction would, in effect, impose additional punishment on persons who have already undergone legal sentencing. However, in the authors' opinion, prisoners serving a life sentence or facing the death penalty provide an exception. Using a scarce allograft to prolong the life of a prisoner so that he or she may fulfill a death sentence seems to conflict with the principle of utility in organ allocation. Psychosocial factors that could jeopardize compliance with post-transplant care deserve special consideration in the evaluation of convicted criminals for transplant candidacy. Moreover, a lack of insurance coverage for transplantation often precludes liver transplantation for prison inmates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Suicidal overdoses/attempts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who present with acute liver failure following a suicide attempt involving a toxic ingestion, such as an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> overdose, require prompt psychological, social work, and chemical dependency evaluation before hepatic coma ensues. In some instances, the suicidal behavior represents an isolated response to a reactive depression with a clear precipitating cause. Such patients who do not have comorbid factors, who express a desire to live, and who meet standard medical criteria have been suggested as appropriate transplant candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, some patients have histories including previous suicidal behavior, chronic psychiatric illness, ongoing substance abuse, and limited social support. In these more complicated cases, the transplant committee must decide whether they feel that a particular patient is at high risk for future self-destructive behavior that would jeopardize post-transplant survival, such as noncompliance with medications or additional suicide attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. In our experience, active alcohol or drug abuse sometimes limits transplant candidacy in adult patients with liver failure related to a suicide attempt.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Transplantation in HIV-infected patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of liver disease, particularly related to viral hepatitis, have increased in patients with HIV who now achieve long term survival on antiretroviral therapy. A number of liver transplant programs perform transplants in HIV-infected recipients. Ethical concerns include the allocation of scarce donor organs to patients who might have inferior outcomes relative to patients without HIV, the risk of rapidly progressive hepatitis C in <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV</span> co-infected transplant recipients, and the risk of HIV transmission to a member of the transplant team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Some have argued that it is not justified to withhold transplantation from patients with well-controlled HIV in the absence of evidence of reduced survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46</a>]. Studies are underway to assess the outcomes of transplantation of patients with HIV including the effect of immunosuppression on HIV progression and the effect of HIV infection on graft survival, particularly in patients with hepatitis C.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Retransplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retransplantation accounts for approximately 10 percent of liver transplants in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The allocation of scarce organs to patients who received a liver transplant and developed graft failure provides an ethical dilemma. &#160;According to the UNOS database, the three-year survival rate in retransplanted patients was 53.7 percent compared with 77.4 percent in primary transplant recipients. A subsequent analysis found that outcomes are particularly reduced for retransplantation of high-risk cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The utilitarian approach to organ allocation would favor primary transplants over repeat transplants, based upon the principle that scarce resources should be distributed to those most likely to benefit. Furthermore, some authorities have argued that retransplant candidates should be given lower priority on the transplant waiting list due to their less favorable outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ethical-issues-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Some also favor primary transplant candidates because they have yet to experience the benefit of liver transplantation, in contrast to those who were previously transplanted. The use of a living liver donor for retransplantation might be justified as there would be no use of scarce cadaveric organs. On the other hand, others feel a moral obligation to provide all available care to transplant recipients, including repeat transplantation. Most centers exclude patients with graft failure related to noncompliance with immunosuppressive medications or alcoholic recidivism. However, patients requiring retransplantation for other indications are often given the same priority as primary transplant candidates, with allocation based upon the MELD score.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61552553\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the number of liver transplants performed in the United States has reached approximately 6000 per year, the demand for donor organs far exceeds the supply. The relative shortage of donor organs provides the basis for many of the ethical issues associated with liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The current system of organ donation in the United States is based on the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 1968 and is referred to as &quot;opting in&quot; or &quot;expressed volunteerism.&quot; This statute authorizes competent adults to specify their preferences regarding organ donation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Organ donation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living donor liver transplantation provides a means to expand the organ supply. One of the main ethical questions regarding the use of living organ donors is whether it is justified to expose a healthy person to harm primarily for the benefit of another. A second related question is whether or not informed consent can really be secured in situations when a person is committed to give part of their liver to save the life of a loved one. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Living donor liver transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The United Network for Organ Sharing oversees organ distribution in the United States. The organ sharing system was designed in an effort to balance utility, justice, and autonomy, irrespective of race, gender, and financial or social status. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Allocation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of liver disease and the clinical setting also raise specific ethical issues.
